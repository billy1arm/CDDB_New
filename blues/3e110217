EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nCapable of producing music at a sufficient volume, the p
EXTT0=iano was a widely popular instrument in African-American entertainmen
EXTT0=t spots across the south in the 1920s and 1930s. Like the guitar, it
EXTT0=s ability to combine harmony and melody simultaneously also made it ve
EXTT0=ry versatile for both solo performance and group accompaniment. Juke J
EXTT0=oint Saturday Night collects 23 of the sort of piano "blues, rags, an
EXTT0=d stomps" one might have heard at a weekend hot spot during the earl
EXTT0=y part of the century. Kicking off with a pair of dazzling piano instr
EXTT0=umentals from "Jabo" Williams, the compilation highlights barrelhous
EXTT0=e players Louis Johnson, James Wiggins, Little Brother Montgomery, Ski
EXTT0=p James, and many more. Best known for his inimitable guitar pieces, J
EXTT0=ames had an equally unique approach to the piano. "22-20 Blues" demons
EXTT0=trates his wild, animated attack. The song is answered immediately wit
EXTT0=h James Wiggins' "Forty-Four Blues." Also included is the tamer but n
EXTT0=o less accomplished "If You Haven't Any Hay," featuring James' call an
EXTT0=d response piano work and a shuffle rhythm provided by his feet. The M
EXTT0=ississippi bluesman acquired the melody for his "Special Rider Blues
EXTT0=" from Little Brother Montgomery, in exchange for teaching the latte
EXTT0=r "Vicksburg Blues." A showcase for his milky vibrato and punctuated w
EXTT0=ith unusual bass runs, "Vicksburg" would become Montgomery's most popu
EXTT0=lar number. Another prominent presence on Juke Joint, Louise Johnson
EXTT0=, first recorded at a session arranged by Charlie Patton. Johnson's vi
EXTT0=brant and bawdy "On the Wall" was apparently representative of her fas
EXTT0=t-living reputation. By the late '30s, jazz and other urban music styl
EXTT0=es began eclipsing country-blues in popularity. While the brass and wo
EXTT0=odwind instruments began replacing acoustic guitars, the piano manage
EXTT0=d to survive. Musicians like Roosevelt Sykes (heard here on "3-6 and 9
EXTT0=") bridged the gap between the older blues and the developing jazz, sp
EXTT0=anning both during his successful career. Like many Yazoo releases, Ju
EXTT0=ke Joint offers a portrait of a style in one of its purest forms, befo
EXTT0=re times and tastes forced it to change.  Nathan Bush
