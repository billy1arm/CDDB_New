EXTD=aking them stars in the process. It couldn't have happened to a better rec

EXTD=right on this, their third album. As their sound gelled, producer Bill Ham
EXTD=discovered how to record the trio so simply that they sound indestructibl
EXTD=e, and the group brought the best set of songs they'd ever have to the tab
EXTD=le. On the surface, there's nothing really special about the record, since
EXTD=it's just a driving blues-rock album from a Texas bar band, but that's wh
EXTD=at's special about it. It has a filthy groove and an infectious feel, than
EXTD=ks to Billy Gibbons' growling guitars and the steady propulsion of Dusty H
EXTD=ill and Frank Beard's rhythm section. They get the blend of bluesy shuffle
EXTD=s, gut-bucket rocking, and off-beat humor just right. ZZ Top's very identi
EXTD=ty comes from this earthy sound and songs as utterly infectious as "Waitin
EXTD=' for the Bus," "Jesus Just Left Chicago," "Move Me on Down the Line," and
EXTD=the John Lee Hooker boogie "La Grange." In a sense, they kept trying to r

EXTD=nal Mix Is Finally Restored, March 6, 2006 \nBy  razzorjet2 (York, PA]\n\n
EXTD=After years of only being able to get the bogus remixed and re-recorded ve
EXTD=rsions of the first 6 ZZ records, Rhino has finally begun issuing the Top 
EXTD=back catalog (Tres Hombres and Fandango so far) faithfully restoring the o
EXTD=riginal mixes of these classic records. The fact that these fine records w
EXTD=ere altered to begin with is a complete travesty. I had to resort to burni
EXTD=ng the original vinyl as CDs because of the previous butchery and doctorin
EXTD=g of these vintage 70's recordings. But now the original mixes are finally
EXTD=available and they sound incredible. Tres Hombres has one of the best mix
EXTD=es of a hard rock album from the early 70's anyway, and to hear it in rema
EXTD=stered digital form is an almost religious experience. Fandango sounds jus
EXTD=t as good, with a little more top end to the recording. I hope Rhino doesn
EXTD='t delay releasing the other 4 albums along with Deguello in original mix,
EXTD=remastered form. I can't wait to hear them. So if you are considering buy
EXTD=ing any of the first 7 ZZ Top CD's, only buy the 2006 remastered, original
EXTD=mix version of Tres Hombres and Fandango, and wait until the others get r
EXTD=eleased in the same format. You'll be glad you waited and saved your money
EXTD=, I can't emphasize enough how terrible the previous releases of these CD'
