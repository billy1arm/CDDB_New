EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nThere's a lot of Reverend Gary Davis out there, but thi
EXTT0=s CD, recorded between 1955 and 1957, is one of the best. Davis was a
EXTT0=t the peak of his powers then. His playing on the instrumentals (of wh
EXTT0=ich there are a surprising number) testify to that, fluid and sturdy
EXTT0=, and when he sings, he's never sounded in better voice. Of particula
EXTT0=r interest is the fact that many of these pieces are made up on the sp
EXTT0=ot  although you'd be hard pressed to tell without the notes. Elsewhe
EXTT0=re come pieces more familiar, albeit in different versions, and  a re
EXTT0=al treat  some that have never been recorded elsewhere. What truly se
EXTT0=ts this apart, though, is a long extract of Davis preaching in church
EXTT0=, a side that's never been documented before. And he's very much a ra
EXTT0=w gospel preacher, of a style that had fallen out of fashion by the 5
EXTT0=0s. To hear him is an absolute revelation  you can feel the fervor i
EXTT0=n his voice, and his power over the congregation. The sound quality th
EXTT0=roughout is superb, and this is an important addition to the Davis can
EXTT0=on.  Chris Nickson
EXTT1=Rev. Gary Davis\n\nIn his prime of life, which is to say the late '20s
EXTT1=, the Reverend Gary Davis was one of the two most renowned practitione
EXTT1=rs of the East Coast school of ragtime guitar - 35 years later, despit
EXTT1=e two decades spent playing on the streets of Harlem in New York, he w
EXTT1=as still one of the giants in his field, playing before thousands of p
EXTT1=eople at a time, and an inspiration to dozens of modern guitarist/sing
EXTT1=ers including Bob Dylan, Taj Mahal, and Donovan - and Jorma Kaukonen, D
EXTT1=avid Bromberg, and Ry Cooder, who studied with Davis. \nDavis was part
EXTT1=ially blind at birth, and lost what little sight he had before he wa
EXTT1=s an adult. He was self-taught on the guitar, beginning at age six, an
EXTT1=d by the time he was in his 20s he had one of the most advanced guita
EXTT1=r techniques of anyone in blues - his only peers among ragtime-based pl
EXTT1=ayers were Blind Arthur Blake, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Blind Willi
EXTT1=e Johnson. Davis himself was a major influence on Blind Boy Fuller
EXTT1=\n\nDavis' influences included gospel, marches, ragtime, jazz, and m
EXTT1=instrel hokum, and he integrated them into a style that was his own. I
EXTT1=n 1911, when Davis was a still teenager, the family moved to Greenvill
EXTT1=e, SC, and he fell under the influence of such local guitar virtuosi a
EXTT1=s Willie Walker, Sam Brooks, and Baby Brooks. Davis moved to Durham i
EXTT1=n the mid-'20s, by which time he was a full-time street musician. He w
EXTT1=as celebrated not only for the diversity of styles that his playing em
EXTT1=braced, but also for his skills with the guitar, which were already vi
EXTT1=rtually unmatched in the blues field. \n\nDavis went into the recordin
EXTT1=g studio for the first time in the '30s with the backing of a local bu
EXTT1=sinessman. Davis cut a mixture of blues and spirituals for the America
EXTT1=n Record Company label, but there was never an equitable agreement abo
EXTT1=ut payment for the recordings, and following these sessions, it was 1
EXTT1=9 years before he entered the studio again. During that period, he wen
EXTT1=t through many changes. Like many other street buskers, Davis always i
EXTT1=nterspersed gospel songs amid his blues and ragtime numbers, to make i
EXTT1=t harder for the police to interrupt him. He began taking the gospel m
EXTT1=aterial more seriously, and in 1937 he became an ordained minister. Af
EXTT1=ter that, he usually refused to perform any blues. \n\nDavis moved t
EXTT1=o New York in the early '40s and began preaching and playing on stree
EXTT1=t corners in Harlem. He recorded again at the end of the 1940s, wit
EXTT1=h a pair of gospel songs, but it wasn't until the mid-'50s that a rea
EXTT1=l following for his work began developing anew. His music, all of it n
EXTT1=ow of a spiritual nature, began showing up on labels such as Stinson
EXTT1=, Folkways, and Riverside, where he recorded seven songs in early 1956
EXTT1=Davis was "rediscovered" by the folk revival movement, and after som
EXTT1=e initial reticence, he agreed to perform as part of the budding fol
EXTT1=k music revival, appearing at the Newport Folk Festival, where his ras
EXTT1=py voiced sung sermons - most notably his transcendent "Samson and Deli
EXTT1=lah (If I Had My Way)"  a song most closely associated with Blind Wil
EXTT1=lie Johnson  and "Twelve Gates to the City," which were highlights o
EXTT1=f the proceedings for several years. He also recorded a live album fo
EXTT1=r the Vanguard label at one such concert, as well as appearing on seve
EXTT1=ral Newport live anthology collections. He was also the subject of tw
EXTT1=o television documentaries, one in 1967 and one in 1970. \n\nDavis bec
EXTT1=ame one of the most popular players on the folk revival and blues revi
EXTT1=val scenes, playing before large and enthusiastic audiences - most of t
EXTT1=he songs that he performed were spirituals, but they weren't that fa
EXTT1=r removed from the blues that he'd recorded in the 1930s, and his guit
EXTT1=ar technique was intact. Davis' skills as a player, on the jumbo Gibso
EXTT1=n acoustic models that he favored, were undiminished, and he was a sta
EXTT1=rtling figure to hear, picking and strumming complicated rhythms and c
EXTT1=ounter-melodies. Davis became a teacher during this period, and his st
EXTT1=udents included some very prominent white guitar players, including Da
EXTT1=vid Bromberg and the Jefferson Airplane's Jorma Kaukonen (who later re
EXTT1=corded Davis' "I'll Be Alright" on his acclaimed solo album Quah!)
EXTT1=\n\nThe Reverend Gary Davis left behind a fairly large body of moder
EXTT1=n (i.e. post-World War II) recordings, well into the 1960s, taking th
EXTT1=e revival of his career in his stride as a way of carrying the messag
EXTT1=e of the gospel to a new generation. He even recorded anew some of hi
EXTT1=s blues and ragtime standards in the studio, for the benefit of his st
EXTT1=udents.  Bruce Eder-=AMG
