EXTD=pendium contains the complete run -- four sets over two nights --
EXTD=by the Doors' at the Felt Forum in New York City January 17 and 
EXTD=18, 1970. Although previously unavailable in its entirety, music 
EXTD=from these programs has shown up prominently throughout several l
EXTD=ive packages -- namely Absolutely Live (1970), and Alive She Crie
EXTD=d (1983). Additionally, over an hour was excerpted to create the 
EXTD="Live in New York" CD within The Doors Box Set (1997). Most any u
EXTD=nissued live material from the original quartet of John Densmore 
EXTD=(drums), Robbie Krieger (guitar), Ray Manzarek (keyboards/vocals)
EXTD=and Jim Morrison (vocals/percussion) could be considered cause f
EXTD=or celebration. However, the experience of hearing the band's ebb
EXTD=and flow as they organically develop the performance in real-tim
EXTD=e -- as opposed to hearing a package of material that has been ch
EXTD=erry-picked after the fact -- is one of several advantages that t
EXTD=he Live in New York (2009) anthology has over its predecessors. A
EXTD=nother is the stunning fidelity throughout, thanks to the work of
EXTD=Doors' original producer/engineer Bruce Botnick and the exhausti
EXTD=ve processes of restoring the eight-track, open-reel master tapes
EXTD=With so much territory to cover -- over seven hours in all -- t
EXTD=here are, inevitably, a few audio dropouts. In those rare instanc
EXTD=es, very good quality substitutions from other sources (of the ex
EXTD=act same material) almost seamlessly fill in any moments that mig
EXTD=ht be missing due to reel changes and the like. Always a question
EXTD=mark in terms of performance quality, Morrison is on pretty good
EXTD=behavior and in exceptional voice. Immediate evidence can be fou
EXTD=nd on the soulful reading of "Blue Sunday" from the first show. H
EXTD=owever, by the final outing, his husky and raspy vocals make it c
EXTD=lear that he is rapidly losing his range. Morrison has also clean
EXTD=ed up his stage prattle in the wake of the infamous occurrence wh
EXTD=ere it was alleged that on March 1, 1969 in Miami, FL Morrison ex
EXTD=posed himself during the show. A warrant was subsequently issued 
EXTD=for his arrest on one felony count of lewd and lascivious behavio
EXTD=r and three misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure, open profani
EXTD=ty, and drunkenness. Certainly far from scared straight, he seems
EXTD=to have gotten the message, and was actually awaiting trial at t
EXTD=he time of these recordings. He even jokingly refers to it during
EXTD=the spoken "Only When the Moon Comes Out" interlude on the 18th.
EXTD=On paper, there is little variance between each of the four set 
EXTD=lists. However, the energy and vibe vacillate significantly from 
EXTD=version to version and show to show. The core inclusions of "Road
EXTD=house Blues," "Ship of Fools," "Alabama Song," "Light My Fire," a
EXTD=nd a combo pairing "Back Door Man" with "Five to One" were played
EXTD=every time. While "Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)," "Break on Through
EXTD=(To the Other Side)," and "Who Do You Love" were done a bit less
EXTD=frequently. On the other hand, there are rarities aplenty as "Bl
EXTD=ue Sunday," "Love Hides," "Little Red Rooster," "Crawling King Sn
EXTD=ake," a half-hearted "Wild Child," "The End," "Celebration of the
EXTD=Lizard," "Close to You" (sung by Manzarek) -- plus the four-song
EXTD=encore on the 18th that includes "Rock Me Baby," "Going to N.Y. 
EXTD=Blues," "Maggie M'Gill," and "Gloria" were only unleashed once. D

EXTD=en, November 20, 2009 \n\nSo I'm 13, and I'm slouching through Ha
EXTD=rvard Square on my way to get Pink Floyd boots at the used record
EXTD=store. I'm just starting to grow my hair long-- which never real
EXTD=ly worked out-- and I'm wearing a grey t-shirt sporting the hundr
EXTD=ed-yard-stare of Jim Morrison of the Doors. From across the stree
EXTD=t, a guy three times my age shouts: "Fuck! Yeah! The Doors!" And 
EXTD=for that moment, we are brothers.\n\nThe Kids in the Hall's Bruce
EXTD=McCulloch argued that Doors fans are born, not made. But he duck
EXTD=s the question of why we're not making them anymore. Today, one o
EXTD=f the first standard-bearers of rock is less hip than Journey. Le
EXTD=t's review the case against the band: First we have Morrison hims
EXTD=elf, who's been blown into a caricature by his super-sexual perso
EXTD=na, his wifty poetry, and his early death in a Paris bathtub. The
EXTD=music sounds like a weird cross between shit-kicking blues-rock 
EXTD=and brain-spraining acid-jams, and it's easier to get your avant-
EXTD=garage fix from the Velvet Underground, your rock shaman verse fr
EXTD=om Patti Smith (or not at all), or your psychedelic extravagance 
EXTD=from countless Nuggets bands. As dead 1960s rockers go, Jimi's le
EXTD=gacy has left Janis and Jim in the dust. It may be a strange way 
EXTD=to put it, but the problem with the Doors is that they were not e
EXTD=fficient.\n\nLet's say that's where you are with this band. So he
EXTD=re's how this set might change your mind.\n\nRhino has reissued a
EXTD=ll four sets from their gig at the Felt Forum in January 1970, ri
EXTD=ght before the release of Morrison Hotel-- and still in the shado
EXTD=w of Morrison's drunken, obnoxious, and allegedly obscene perform
EXTD=ance in Miami, which threatened him with jail time. Many tracks f
EXTD=rom these shows have been released before, but on this box you ca
EXTD=n listen to them bootleg-style, with all the repeated songs, tuni
EXTD=ng breaks, and banter with the audience.\n\nThe Live in New York 
EXTD=set sounds like an unedited performance, but in fact, the tapes h
EXTD=ad been so worked-over for other live albums that the team had to
EXTD=meticulously reconstruct it from 8-track and 2-track source tape
EXTD=s, using fan tapes as reference. Guest John Sebastian's harmonica
EXTD=wasn't even captured in the original mix - producer Bruce Botnick
EXTD=brought him back to the studio this year to replay the solos, ba
EXTD=sed on what they got from tape bleed. Why go to the trouble? Beca
EXTD=use this is the truth. It's what the Doors sounded like, without 
EXTD=the heavy hand of an Oliver Stone looking for the juicy parts-- a
EXTD=nd without the impatience of the iPod generation trying to trim i
EXTD=t down.\n\nAs you listen to the set, Morrison doesn't come off as
EXTD=a self-absorbed mystic: He's far more like the troubled kid in s
EXTD=chool who couldn't sit still and didn't fear anything. He demands
EXTD=and rewards attention. He's petulant with the audience, even bar
EXTD=king at them or pleading to "give the singer some" when they won'
EXTD=t stop talking.\n\nThe vibe from the crowd may explain why the fo
EXTD=urth show starts rough: After scolding the crowd, Morrison sounds
EXTD=disengaged or mocking as he wanders through the first few songs.
EXTD=But then he suddenly rewards the audience with a rare performanc
EXTD=e of his rock suite/poetry slam, "Celebration of the Lizard". The
EXTD=piece isn't exactly a lost classic-- it's not his most powerful 
EXTD=verse, and musically it doesn't gel like "The End"-- but the best
EXTD=thing about this recording is how into it Morrison gets, from th
EXTD=e quiet couplets to the screams. It's easy to see how people fell
EXTD=in love with the poet no matter the poetry, although some of his
EXTD=verse is still dangerous: The "Horse Latitudes" poem that he int
EXTD=erjects in "Moonlight Drive" boasts his strongest imagery, and th
EXTD=e contrast between that and the seaside groove is still striking.
EXTD=\n\nThe rest of the band is here to support the star, and it neve
EXTD=r lets him down: The Doors were a loose, groovy, and ferocious co
EXTD=mbo, here playing a setlist that sticks to rock and blues and ski
EXTD=ps all the winsome and folky stuff that cluttered up Waiting for 
EXTD=the Sun and The Soft Parade. Organist Ray Manzarek played the hoo
EXTD=ks that turned songs like "Hello, I Love You" into pop hits, but 
EXTD=here he's focused on driving the rhythm section. Even his legenda
EXTD=ry solo on "Light My Fire" changes in concert from a melodic impr
EXTD=ovisation to a jam that climaxes in frustration, as you can hear 
EXTD=him stabbing the keys with all ten fingers and wishing he had ano
EXTD=ther ten besides. On the other hand, guitarist Robby Krieger is f
EXTD=erocious right from the riff of "Roadhouse Blues", and he makes t
EXTD=heir cover of Bo Diddley's "Who Do You Love" one of the best reco
EXTD=rdings the Doors ever made.\n\nHistory hates this band for its ex
EXTD=cess, but so what? The Doors thrived on excess. When Morrison gea
EXTD=rs up the crowd with his groin and his ego and roars, "gonna have
EXTD=a re-al, good time," no excess, no overdose, no scream is big en
EXTD=ough for the good time he's got in mind. And that's the way to re
EXTD=member him.\n\n\n-- RELATED INFO --------------------------------

EXTD=from RollingStone.com\n\nDoors' Final New York Concerts Emerge as
EXTD=Six-Disc Collection \n8/27/09, 10:03 am EST\n\nThe Doors' final 
EXTD=four concerts with Jim Morrison in the Big Apple will be released
EXTD=in their entirety November 10th in a six-disc collection called 
EXTD=Live in New York. Nearly a third of the set's 90 tracks were prev
EXTD=iously unreleased, including performances of "Break on Through," 
EXTD="Soul Kitchen" and "When The Music's Over." The four shows were r
EXTD=ecorded on January 17th and 18th, 1970, with both days featuring 
EXTD=early and late gigs at New York's Felt Forum (the adjunct venue n
EXTD=ext to Madison Square Garden now called the WaMu Theatre).\n\nAft
EXTD=er playing Madison Square Garden in 1969, the Doors opted for the
EXTD=Felt Forum to showcase their then-new album Morrison Hotel. "It 
EXTD=was more intimate, and you could feel the audience more," drummer
EXTD=John Densmore said in a statement. "There was more interaction, 
EXTD=and the acoustics were much better, because it was designed for m
EXTD=usic." \n\nKeyboardist Ray Manzarek added that the concerts were 
EXTD=reminiscent of the Doors' small-club days in Los Angeles. "We use
EXTD=d to do four sets a night at the London Fog, and we only had a sm
EXTD=all block of songs written up to that time. So we would do other 
EXTD=people's material. And in New York, it was like the same thing," 
EXTD=Manzarek said. "We've got four shows to play here, two sets tonig
EXTD=ht, two sets tomorrow night. Let's play whatever we want! Let's j
EXTD=ust go!"\n\nIn addition to the Live in New York collection, Rhino
EXTD=will also rerelease all of the Jim Morrison-era Doors albums on 
EXTD=180-gram vinyl on September 15th. \n\n\n-- RELATED INFO ---------

EXTD=ors - Live In New York (Bright Midnight R2 521457]\nNovember 23, 
EXTD=2009, gsparaco @ 2:29 pm\n\nThe Doors' four Felt Forum shows in N
EXTD=ew York in 1970 were among the most requested and anticipated  sh
EXTD=ows collectors wanted to see released when Bright Midnight began.
EXTD=After almost a decade of waiting Live In New York was finally r
EXTD=eleased this November.  The sound and editing on these discs is t
EXTD=remendous, perhaps some of the best work yet to be released by th
EXTD=is label.  \n\nThe notes accompanying this set claim:  "A long, l
EXTD=ong time ago, when nobody thought that we would ever need the 8-t
EXTD=rack tapes again, many bits and pieces were removed from these sh
EXTD=ows and were scattered through many Doors albums. Large chunks we
EXTD=re used in Absolutely Live, An American Prayer, and Alive, She Cr
EXTD=ied. Goings-on between Jim and the audience, as well as parts of 
EXTD=songs from the 8-track masters, have disappeared forever, though 
EXTD=some do exist on the live 2-track tapes. Through the generous hel
EXTD=p of a few of our Doors collectors, we were able to obtain person
EXTD=al copies of audience recordings that helped us sort out the road
EXTD=map, show us what bits went where, and determine exactly what wa
EXTD=s missing.\n\n"In putting this project together, The Doors and I 
EXTD=agreed that it was very important to have complete shows. The pla
EXTD=n was to insert the audience and the live 2-track recordings wher
EXTD=e chunks were missing from our masters, in order to have a faithf
EXTD=ul reproduction of the concert. So, you might be rocking to 'Five
EXTD=To One' or 'Light My Fire,' and all of a sudden the sound might 
EXTD=change into the live 2-track or an audience recording, and then b
EXTD=ack again. We tried to keep this at a minimum, but felt that goin
EXTD=g about it in this fashion would, in the end, be a more satisfyin
EXTD=g experience.  Beyond the audience recordings that have been circ
EXTD=ulating through the Doors-o-sphere, this is the first time that w
EXTD=e have all four concerts complete."\n\nThe sound quality and edit
EXTD=ing done on these shows is so good that they are not noticeable a
EXTD=t all.  Bright Midnight have more than atoned for their messing u
EXTD=p of the Matrix shows earlier in  the year with this release.  \n
EXTD=\nThe previous Doors show in New York was a year before on Januar
EXTD=y 24th, 1969 at Madison Square Garden, being one of the first roc
EXTD=k bands to play the venue.  These four are at the relatively inti
EXTD=mate, 5,000 capacity Felt Forum.  Occuring three weeks before the
EXTD=release of  Morrison Hotel, they preview several new songs like 
EXTD="Roadhouse Blues," "Peace Frog," "Ship Of Fools," and "Maggie M'G
EXTD=ill."  The band's tactic at this time, after the cool reception o
EXTD=f The Soft Parade, was a return to the roots by playing the blues
EXTD=This was reflected not only in the style of the new album, but
EXTD=also by their inclusion of covers such as Bo Diddley's "Who Do Y
EXTD=ou Love," Howlin' Wolf's "Little Red Rooster," and John Lee Hooke
EXTD=r's "Crawling King Snake."\n\nThe Doors are not represented well 
EXTD=in the current underground market.  There have been two silver Do
EXTD=ors boots released in the past three years.  But the Forum shows 
EXTD=are among the earliest Doors tapes to be booted in the late eight
EXTD=ies and early nineties.  Build Me A Woman - The Live Experience (
EXTD=Great Dane Records GDR CD 8908) in 1989, Live In New York 1970 (A
EXTD=rmando Curcio Editore DIR 46) in 1990 and New York 1970 - Live (S
EXTD=tentor Sten 91.001) in 1991 were a mixture of the two January 17t
EXTD=h shows.\n\nOther songs can be found on various bootleg compilati
EXTD=ons such as Break On Through (Live and Alive LA CD 110) released in
EXTD=1993 and Celebration Of The Lizard (Sarabandas (Allegra) CD 9019
EXTD=) a few yers after.  A few are dedicated to one of the particular
EXTD=shows such as New York Blues (Document Records DR 033) in 1988 a
EXTD=nd disc one of Do You Wanna Have Fun Tonight (Oh Boy OH BOY 2-912
EXTD=7) in 1991 feature the late show on January 17th and Freedom Man 
EXTD=The Doors in 1970 (Banzai BZBX 036/037/038) with the January 18
EXTD=th early show.\n\nNeedless to say this really puts to rest any pr
EXTD=evious release of these shows, both official and unofficial.  The
EXTD=six discs are housed in cardboard pockets and it also comes with
EXTD=a hard cover small booklet with a long and detailed summary of t
EXTD=he New York shows, the after show party thrown by Jack Holtzman a
EXTD=nd the work done on the current release.   \n\nIn what would turn
EXTD=out to be the Doors' final New York shows with Jim Morrison, the
EXTD=New York audience receives them enthusiastically.  Mike Jahn, wr
EXTD=iting in The New York Times, points out that:  "The Doors, the Lo
EXTD=s Angeles rock group, fought off repeated assaults by young membe
EXTD=rs of their audience...Onstage assaults, where teen-age girls mus
EXTD=t be pried off the bodies of the performers, are tributes usually
EXTD=reserved for the best-known rock idols.  Saturday (January 17th)
EXTD=, at least two dozen teen-age girls and quite a few boys had to b
EXTD=e dragged away from The Doors' singer, Jim Morrison, by stagehand
EXTD=s.  The other three Doors - Robbie Krieger, guitar - John Densmore
EXTD=, drums - and Ray Manzarek, organ - played on unperturbed."  Jahn 
EXTD=goes on to say that:  "The Doors played their familiar songs quit
EXTD=e well, much better than in last year's concert in the Garden."  
EXTD=He also claims that they "confined themselves to their older mate
EXTD=rial" which isn't true since many songs from the new album are pl
EXTD=ayed.  \n\n\n** Felt Forum, New York, NY - January 17th, 1970 (fi
EXTD=rst show) **\n\nDisc 1 (74:21):  Start Of Show, Roadhouse Blues, 
EXTD=Ship Of Fools, Break On Through (To The Other Side), Tuning, Peac

EXTD=ed Rooster, Money, Tuning, Light My Fire, More More More, Soul Ki
EXTD=tchen, End Of Show\n\nThe first Felt Forum show is the shortest a
EXTD=nd most "standard" of the four.  In addition to having several tr
EXTD=acks represented on the above unofficial releases, the tape for t
EXTD=his show also circulated under the Westbury Music Festival (Octop
EXTD=us) hoax.  "Peace Frog," "Blue Sunday" and "Money" were also feat
EXTD=ured on The Doors: Box Set Disc 2: Live In New York released in 1
EXTD=997.\n\nThey whisk through the set with very little time to slow 
EXTD=down and take a breath.  Morrison says nothing to the audience ou
EXTD=tside of singing the songs and there is very little onstage impro
EXTD=visation in the numbers.  The audience also sound very subdued as
EXTD=well and don't really seem to get into the show until they play 
EXTD="Back Door Man."  That four of the first five songs were unfamili
EXTD=ar at the time probably had something to do with that.\n\nPerform
EXTD=ance does hit a peak with "Five To One" and the string of cover t
EXTD=unes played before "Light My Fire" which naturally is played at a
EXTD=ll four shows.  Since it is such an improvisational song it tends
EXTD=to differ between performances.  At just over eight minutes this
EXTD=is the shortest of the four.  There is two minutes of audience c
EXTD=heering before the band come back out for the only encore "Soul K
EXTD=itchen."  Overall it is a good first show but they will get bette
EXTD=r. \n\n** Felt Forum, New York, NY - January 17th, 1970 (second s

EXTD=nd looser than the first.  It circulated on a very good to almost
EXTD=excellent audience recording that is incomplete, missing from th
EXTD=e show (between "Build Me A Woman" and "The End") is "Who Do You 
EXTD=Love," "Wild Child (Attempt)," "When The Music's Over," "Light My
EXTD=Fire," "Soul Kitchen," and the little joke Jim tells.  Four song
EXTD=s, "Roadhouse Blues," "Ship of Fools," "Crawling King Snake" and 
EXTD="The End" were used on The Doors: Box Set Disc 2: Live In New Yor
EXTD=k but now thankfully we have the entire performance in excellent 
EXTD=sound quality.\n\nThe tape starts as the appear on stage.  Morris
EXTD=on greets the audience, saying "how you doing?"  There is a short
EXTD=tuning and delay which prompts him to joke, "everything is fucke
EXTD=d up as usual" before they start in with an aggressive version of
EXTD="Roadhouse Blues" and a performance of "Break On Through" which 
EXTD=Manzarek dominates on organ.  "Peace Frog" and "Blue Sunday" are 
EXTD=dropped in favor of a cover of John Lee Hooker's "Crawling King S
EXTD=nake," a tune they would record later in the year for L.A. Woman.
EXTD=\n\nAnother interesting cover in the first half of the show is Bo
EXTD=Diddley's "Who Do You Love?"  They stretch the song out to nine 
EXTD=minutes long and Krieger throws in the melody of "Willie And The 
EXTD=Hand Jive" by Johnny Otis in the middle.  "Wild Child" from The S
EXTD=oft Parade is given an attempt but is abandoned for "When The Mus
EXTD=ic's Over."  For fifteen minutes they improvise in the middle and
EXTD=it's during this song people rush the stage prompting Morrison t
EXTD=o make the famous remark "well that's New York for you.  The only
EXTD=people to rush the stage are guys."\n\n"Light My Fire" is a bit 
EXTD=longer in the second performance, lasting nine minutes with a for
EXTD=ceful solo by Krieger in the middle.  Afterwards Morrison asks fo
EXTD=r the lights to remain as they are before they play the first enc
EXTD=ore "Soul Kitchen."  Morrison tells a lame joke afterwards ("did 
EXTD=you ever hear the one about the blind man who passed the fish sto
EXTD=re?  You know what he said?  Hi girls.")  \n\n"The End" is given 
EXTD=its only performance in out of the four shows.  Morrison shouting
EXTD=out "bring out your dead!" is a prelude before the band start th
EXTD=e tune.  Since there is no time to end they take their time playi
EXTD=ng the song, stretching it out to nineteen minutes including the 
EXTD="ride the snake" interlude.  The last track on the disc is the pr
EXTD=omoter thanking everyone for coming and wishing them a good night
EXTD=This is one of the best shows they performed in the Felt Forum

EXTD=than the evening show which is longer and much more loose.  "Road
EXTD=house Blues" and "Ship Of Fools" start off the show and sound str
EXTD=aight with no variations.  But Manzarek then plays an interesting
EXTD=variation on the introduction to "Break On Through" which livens
EXTD=up the show a little.  There is a forty second tune up before th
EXTD=e only Felt Forum performance of the excellent "Universal Mind." 
EXTD=\n\nManzarek begins "Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)" but has to call 
EXTD=a halt when there is a loud, piercing whistle going thorough the 
EXTD=PA.  "If it ain't one things it's another" Morrison quips while t
EXTD=he roadies work on the organ.  "Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)" resume
EXTD=s and is played as part of a medley that includes also "Back Door
EXTD=Man" and "Five To One."  \n\nA tight performance of "Moonlight D
EXTD=rive" follows which has a recitation of "Horse Latitudes" in the 
EXTD=middle.  "Who Do You Love" is only six minutes long but like the 
EXTD=late show the previous evening contains the "Willie And The Hand 
EXTD=Jive" reference.  There is a delay before the last song since the
EXTD=buzz from Manzarek's organ comes back.  "Thank you for being so 
EXTD=patient.  It usually takes us about an hour to get warmed up" Mor
EXTD=rison says before they play the "radio song" "Light My Fire."  A 
EXTD=wild twelve minute long version of "When The Music's Over" closes
EXTD=the early show. \n\n** Felt Forum, New York, NY - January 18th,

EXTD=: Box Set Disc 2: Live In New York contains two songs from this s
EXTD=how, the seventeen minute "The Celebration of the Lizard" and the
EXTD="Poontang Blues/Build Me a Woman/Sunday Trucker" medley.\n\nMorr
EXTD=ison speaks the the audience before the first song, saying that "
EXTD=I know what you do in the bathrooms" before they start a strange 
EXTD=version of "Roadhouse Blues."  Morrison experiments with a differ
EXTD=ent vocal melody leaving the rest of the band befuddled.  Instead
EXTD=of playing "Break On Through" they follow with "Peace Frog" inst
EXTD=ead which, instead of segueing into "Blue Sunday" is linked to "A
EXTD=labama Song (Whiskey Bar)."  A lascivious "Back Door Man" follows
EXTD=and runs straight into "Five To One."\n\nAfterwards Morrison tel
EXTD=ls they audience they "have a special treat."  They are going to 
EXTD=play "a tour-de-force we've only played a few times in front of s
EXTD=trangers" and tell audience to relax and "think about your eventu
EXTD=al end."  There is a delay so Morrison continues, reminding them 
EXTD=that they are recording "and if you want to be represented in ete
EXTD=rnity with some uncouth language then I hope you stand up on the 
EXTD=top of your seat and shout it too clearly or else we're not gonna
EXTD=get it on tape."  What follows is a sixteen minute, disjointed "
EXTD=Celebration Of The Lizard."  \n\n"Pootang Blues" is a short impro
EXTD=visatory boogie played as an introduction to "Build Me A Woman." 
EXTD=They continue after a twelve minute "When The Music's Over" with
EXTD="Soul Kitchen" which has the prayer "as I lay me down to sleep" 
EXTD=in the middle.  Morrison jokes around afterwards, telling them th
EXTD=at, "for fear of getting too patriotic, we're going to attempt a 
EXTD=rendition of the national anthem" before reciting the beginning o
EXTD=f "The Soft Parade" as an introduction to a eleven minute, advent
EXTD=urous version of "Light My Fire."  "Close To You" with Manzarek c
EXTD=loses the show.\n\nBefore the encores Morrison introdcues John Se
EXTD=bastian of The Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian who plays harmoni
EXTD=ca on "Rock Me."  Drummer Dallas Taylor, who'd played on Crosby, 
EXTD=Stills and Nash's debut, joined for Taylor for "Going To N.Y. Blues
EXTD=" and "Maggie M'Gill."  They try to figure what to play to end th
EXTD=e night and it takes Krieger to start playing "Gloria" for the re
EXTD=st of them to follow and they give a long, thirteen minute versio
EXTD=n of the piece.\n\nThe Bright Midnight label received much critic
EXTD=ism over the years for not delivering on their promise of four to
EXTD=six releases a year.  And they really took a hit with the Matrix
EXTD=shows by using high generation tapes but claiming they were from
EXTD=the master.  Live In New York is so good it will alleviate any s
EXTD=uch concerns and more than makes up for their misjudgements.  The
EXTD=timeliness, the packaging and the soudn quality of the tapes pus
EXTD=hes this close to being the definitive live statement of The Door
EXTD=s available in any form and is an essential title for the collect
EXTD=ion.  \n\n\n-- RELATED INFO -------------------------------------
