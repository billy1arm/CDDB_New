EXTD=r 7, 1995\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Blood, Sweat and Tears' 11-track Gr
EXTD=eatest Hits album, released in February 1972, contained all of th
EXTD=e group's six Top 40 singles, plus notable tracks from its two be
EXTD=st albums, Child Is Father to the Man and Blood, Sweat and Tears. A
EXTD=lmost 24 years later came this 32-track, 138-and-a-half-minute, d
EXTD=ouble-CD expansion, much of it extraneous. Where Greatest Hits co
EXTD=ntained the single edits of songs like "You've Made Me So Very Ha
EXTD=ppy" and "And When I Die," here "all titles are original album ve
EXTD=rsions," as the back cover noted, which means the jazzy interlude
EXTD=s, frequently having nothing to do with the rest of the song, rem
EXTD=ained. There were a couple of unreleased tracks, and otherwise th
EXTD=e bloated running time was filled out by, for example, four track
EXTD=s from the 1972 stiff New Blood, which didn't even feature singer
EXTD=David Clayton-Thomas. Legacy would have better served consumers 
EXTD=by either expanding the original 41-minute Greatest Hits to prope
EXTD=r CD length with a few bonus tracks or reissuing the first two al
EXTD=bums in a double-disc set, again with a few bonus tracks to fill 
EXTD=up the time. This compilation did not enhance the band's reputati
EXTD=on. And the error-filled liner notes are less than worthless.  --

EXTD=T Collection, August 26, 2000\nReviewer: A music fan\nIf your app
EXTD=reciation for Blood Sweat and Tears goes beyond just the "hits," th
EXTD=en this is the set for you. In addition to the full-length (not e
EXTD=dited for radio) versions of such B.S.& T. classics as "Spinning 
EXTD=Wheel," "Hi-De-Ho" and "Lucretia McEvil," this collection contain
EXTD=s the essential tracks that defined their unique mixture of sound
EXTD=s. From jazz-heavy gems like "Smiling Phases," and "Something's C
EXTD=omin' On," to Rockin' cuts like "Go Down Gamblin'" and "More and Mo
EXTD=re," Blood Sweat and Tears versatility remains truly refreshing. Al
EXTD=Kooper's pre David Clayton Thomas contribution particulary on "I
EXTD=Can't Quit Her," and "I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know," ma
EXTD=ke this a true retrospective. Unfortunately, both discs are not c
EXTD=reated equal. The second disc is a little thin featuring many cut
EXTD=s between David Clayton Thomas' two stints with the group. Howeve
EXTD=r as a total package, this is a must for serious Blood Sweat and Te
EXTD=ars fans.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nMusic is Father to the J
EXTD=oyful Experience!, May 10, 2000\nReviewer: Archie Mercer "Archie"
EXTD=(Fullerton, CA USA]\nBlood Sweat and Tears started out as 8 musici
EXTD=ans trying to make ends meet. It ended (well kind of since Clayto
EXTD=n-Thomas is still fronting a version of the band) as a 9 piece gr
EXTD=oup with no direction. In between was a lot of great music that c
EXTD=ritics never could figure out. Were they a rock group? Or maybe J
EXTD=azz? The point here is that sometimes people think too darn hard 
EXTD=about what's behind the music, and never take the opportunity to 
EXTD=just enjoy it. Starting with "Child is Father to the Man" BS&T ke
EXTD=pt changing and refining their sound and music. This Greatest Hit
EXTD=s collection gives the listener a wonderful feel of how their mus
EXTD=ic evolved. Some the early covers, such as Traffic's "Smiling Pha
EXTD=ses" and Laura Nyro's "And When I Die" show the ability to change
EXTD=styles without missing a beat. It's also interesting to note tha
EXTD=t while 5 songs were included from BS&T 4, they left off probably
EXTD=the best of the lot, which was "Redemption". This oversight is m
EXTD=ade up for later by the inclusion of the live version of "Mean Ol
EXTD=e World" which was originally recorded by the band with Jerry LaC
EXTD=roix on lead vocals but brought to life by Clayton-Thomas after h
EXTD=e returned to the group. Other notable songs include "John the Ba
EXTD=ptist", an Al Kooper piece from BS&T 4, "Snow Queen/Maiden Voyage
EXTD=" and "40,000 Headman", another Traffic cover. If you like a lot 
EXTD=of different styles of music, from rock to jazz, from pop to blue
EXTD=s, "do yourself a favor/wake up to your mind/life is what you mak

EXTD=e, people don't want tuna with good taste - they want tuna that ta
EXTD=stes good." BS&T's debut hit all the right notes and should have 
EXTD=been a big hit, but the masses weren't ready to accept it. Instea

EXTD=romises and gives you both. \nDisc-1 contains four tracks from Ch
EXTD=ild Is Father to the Man and inlcudes most of the hits most fans 
EXTD=will recognize. Disc-2 tracks BS&T's decline in popularity. Only 
EXTD="Go Down Gamblin'" reached the Top 40.\n\nWhile BS&T's Greatest H
EXTD=its would also give you all the hits on a single disc--and cheape

EXTD=ralia Australia]\n"What Goes Up" is an excellent overview of BS&T

EXTD="I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know", are a refreshing change

EXTD=the band were pioneers in the realm of jazz-rock fusion. Leader 
EXTD=Al Kooper took the progressive ideas of his former group, the Blu

EXTD=horn-rock link between the Buckinghams and Chicago. Though far re
EXTD=moved from Kooper's original vision, this music is undeniably cat
