EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW: This limited-edition (3000 copies) box screams
EXTD=old school. From its album sized packaging to the sepia toned ph
EXTD=otos, rare poster reproductions and pictures of the artists, the 
EXTD=four-disc anthology is geared towards collectors with an eye to t
EXTD=he past. The first of three sets (soul and vocal groups are the o
EXTD=ther two genres covered) celebrating Atlantic's 60th anniversary 
EXTD=in 2007 is an 80-track trawl through blues rarities, obscurities 
EXTD=and a few ringers that helped put the label on the map. Logically
EXTD=kicking off with the label's first hit, Sticks McGhee's "Drinkin

EXTD=ace" Lewis, and that's just disc one. Some usual suspects such as
EXTD=Big Joe Turner, T-Bone Walker, Ray Charles and LaVern Baker also
EXTD=appear as the discs unfold, yet the mysterious absence of anythi
EXTD=ng from the mega popular Ruth Brown is unexplained. Notes from co

EXTD=Cream and Led Zeppelin, whose early releases would fit within th
EXTD=e titular time span, are rightly ignored in deference to more tra
EXTD=ditional artists Freddie King and Otis Rush, despite the guitaris
EXTD=t's releases having a minimal impact on their already established
EXTD=careers. Aretha Franklin, best known for her legendary soul reco
EXTD=rded for Atlantic, also appears late in disc four with three terr
EXTD=ific blues numbers from the late '60s. Even with such rootsy name
EXTD=s as Leadbelly and Guitar Slim, the set veers towards the jump bl

EXTD=ile it's surely not meant for newcomers, this is a well compiled 
EXTD=and produced set of important and often rousing music that aficio
