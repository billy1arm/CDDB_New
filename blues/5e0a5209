EXTD=Originally Released July 21, 1987\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Dream Evi
EXTD=l is by no means a departure from the Dio formula that was so suc
EXTD=cessful for his first three solo albums. All of the elements that
EXTD=made them so successful are yet again retained here. However, wh
EXTD=at makes things different this time around is that Dio has more o
EXTD=f a melodious side to him, which he puts use here rather than rel
EXTD=ying on the riffs and delivery he learned at the school of Sabbat
EXTD=h. He even touches on the power ballad (a sure sign that the styl
EXTD=e had fully infiltrated metal) with "All the Fool Sailed Away." T
EXTD=he title track and "Sunset Superman" also proved to be two of Dio
EXTD='s most well-known, and most loved songs in his massive catalog. 
EXTD=Not an essential release, but one that diehard fans will be sure 
EXTD=to want in their collection.  -- Rob Theakston\n\nAMAZON.COM CUST

EXTD=gh!, November 30, 2005\nReviewer: Mr. Sinister (El Cajon, CA USA)
EXTD=\nThose people who thought or think that Dream Evil is really goo
EXTD=d Dio are either too young to understand Dio or not big enough fa
EXTD=ns to realize mediocrity when they hear it. Now...Vivian Cambell 
EXTD=is gone and Craig Goldie is brought on board. Ressurected from Di
EXTD=o's pet project Rough Cutt the San Diego kid is way too much of a
EXTD=Blackmore freak and way too mezmerised by Dio's presence (don't 
EXTD=get me wrong, I think Goldie is a pretty good f*cking gutar playe
EXTD=r). The lyrics are thin and slightly dull-witted and the guitar s
EXTD=olos are strained. There is an element of passion on Dream Evil t
EXTD=hat is not even hinted at. By this album, Dio seems to be on auto
EXTD=pilot, believing his own hype and regurgitating the same old sor
EXTD=cery and voodoo elements. But...and this is a big one, it is stil
EXTD=l listenable. Weird. Even Dio's most uninspired tripe is still a 
EXTD=good turn now and then. Not completely awful as it could have bee
EXTD=n, Dream evil just seems like Dio-lite. The margerine of Dio. The
EXTD=Dio that should not be. Call it what you will. I you think Dream
EXTD=Evil is a top-notch Dio effort, then...you just don't get it. \n
EXTD=\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n4.5 stars - Dio's final album of th
EXTD=e eighties, April 28, 2005\nReviewer: Darth Kommissar (Las Vegas,
EXTD=NV (USA)]\nDream Evil (1987.) Dio's fourth album. \n\nIn 1987, R
EXTD=onnie James Dio's solo band suffered an unexpected loss - guitari
EXTD=st Vivian Campbell, the axeman who had played lead on the first t
EXTD=hree albums, left the group. With him gone, Dio recruited replace
EXTD=ment Craig Goldy. Dio had never recorded solo material without Ca
EXTD=mpbell at his side, meaning this would be the time in his career 
EXTD=that would define whether or not he could survive without the vir
EXTD=tuoso at his side. Would Goldy lead Dio's band into a new golden 
EXTD=age, or would Ronnie James crash and burn without the man whose r
EXTD=iffs had made his first three albums metal masterpieces? Read on 
EXTD=for my review of 1987's Dream Evil - the first album to feature G
EXTD=oldy. \n\nThis album is, believe it or not, an improvement over S
EXTD=acred Heart, the final and weakest album of the Vivian Campbell e
EXTD=ra. It's not Holy Diver or The Last In Line, but very few albums 
EXTD=by any artists, even Dio himself, even come close to those two. T
EXTD=he sound here features some mild keyboards and it is somewhat com
EXTD=mercial-sounding, albeit not nearly as much as the previous album
EXTD=The end result is one of Dio's finest and most underrated solo 
EXTD=efforts. There are a ton of excellent songs on this album, and sa
EXTD=dly, none of them became very big hits for Ronnie James. Among th
EXTD=e excellent songs on this album is the awesome opener, Night Peop
EXTD=le. Why didn't this song become a bigger hit? Also we've got the 
EXTD=lengthy, semi-epic masterpiece All The Fools Sailed away - anothe
EXTD=r masterpiece the critcs overlooked. Even some of Dio's fans over
EXTD=look it! Naked In The Rain shows off Dio's musical diversity, cre
EXTD=ating a song that is more melodic than what he normally does, but
EXTD=it's still excellent. Overlove serves up bluesy hard rock not un
EXTD=like that of Coverdale-era Deep Purple, and it too is excellent. 
EXTD=One of the more popular songs on the album was I Could Have Been 
EXTD=A Dreamer, which is one of Dio's most commercial-sounding solo so
EXTD=ngs. Despite the obvious attempt at commerciality, the song remai
EXTD=ns excellent. Ultimately, every song on this album is solid, alth
EXTD=ough not to the same level as the first two solo albums (Dio woul
EXTD=d NEVER top those.) If you're a fan of Dio, you must add this one
EXTD=to your collection. \n\nDio's albums (the Warner ones) were reis
EXTD=sued several years back, but the time has come for better edition
EXTD=s to be released. Remastering would be nice on these albums, as w
EXTD=ell as expanded liner notes and bonus tracks. These current versi
EXTD=ons of the album are okay, but seriously, they could use the reis
EXTD=suing/remastering/revamping badly. \n\nDream Evil was a truly exc
EXTD=ellent album, and it's a shame it's the most underrated album of 
EXTD=Dio's eighties catalogue. Craig Goldy is an excellent guitarist, 
EXTD=and it really is disappointing to see that he never got as much c
EXTD=redit as that sell-out Vivian Campbell (Campbell sold out BIG TIM
EXTD=E after leaving Dio, going onto the pop-metal version of Whitesna
EXTD=ke and the oh-so-pathetic modern incarnation of Def Leppard.) Man
EXTD=y Dio fans call this his last great album, and while I would beg 
EXTD=to differ, I would say that it is indeed, the end of an era for D
EXTD=io - he'd never sound like this again, ever. To put it simply - i
EXTD=f you've got a classic metal collection and you're working on fil
EXTD=ling up the Dio portion of it, don't overlook this underrated alb
EXTD=um.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n"the dark that you find in the
EXTD=back of your mind", April 11, 2005\nReviewer: mwreview "mwreview
EXTD=" (Northern California, USA]\nI became a metalhead in the late 19
EXTD=80s and immediately became a fan of Ronnie James Dio. Dream Evil 
EXTD=(1987) was the first Dio album I bought and it was and remains on
EXTD=e of my favorite metal albums of all-time. In fact, it is definit
EXTD=ely in my top 3. I went on to buy Dio's back catalog of albums, b
EXTD=ut Dream Evil is still the best. Dio's previous albums are great,
EXTD=of course, but there are at least one of two weak tracks on them
EXTD=: "Mystery" and "Eat Your Heart Out" on The Last in Line, maybe "
EXTD=Shame on the Night" off Holy Diver, and, let's face it, several t
EXTD=racks off Sacred Heart. Dream Evil is absolutely solid! Every tra
EXTD=ck is awesome! When I make Dio compilation tapes, it is difficult
EXTD=to decide which Dream Evil tracks to leave off. \n\nThe best of 
EXTD=the best are the powerful title track, the adrenaline-driving "Fa
EXTD=ces in the Window" and the beautiful epic track "All the Fools Sa
EXTD=iled Away." The latter was a single with a cool, dark, nautical v
EXTD=ideo complete with bon fires, spooky sailing ship, skeletons in a
EXTD=lifeboat, and Ronnie and the boys looking great in their classic
EXTD=frilly shirts and jackets. "I Could Have Been a Dreamer," anothe
EXTD=r excellent track, also offered a rarely-seen video. "Naked in th
EXTD=e Rain" is another favorite of mine. The line: "Two children, gun
EXTD=s loaded, take aim and blow all the dreams away" is my favorite p
EXTD=art of the track. It is musically, and lyrically very powerful. T
EXTD=he use of keyboards in "When a Woman Cries" really makes the last
EXTD=track unique. So I do not sound like a sycophant, I will give on
EXTD=e criticism: "Sunset Superman" is extremely repetitive at the end
EXTD=Other than this one gripe, Dream Evil is just about perfect. If
EXTD=you only have Dio's first two more well-known releases, and some
EXTD=how missed out on Dream Evil, get it now! It will not disappoint!

EXTD=There's less keyboards and more guitars. Like previous albums, 
EXTD=Dream Evil kicks off with a fast track entitled Night People (one
EXTD=of the best tracks on the CD) and is followed by the solid title
EXTD=track. Sunset Superman has good guitars but suffers from a somew

EXTD=eviewer: Anand Lakshmikanth "metal_dazed" (Blacksburg, VA, USA]\n
EXTD=What is good about this album is that it still maintains the trad
EXTD=emark DIO sound, and whats' bad about this release is the absence
EXTD=of Vivian Campbell. Craig Goldy is not a bad guitarist, but Viv 
EXTD=sure is 10 motches better than his successor in the band. Save fo
EXTD=r 4 songs, "Night People", "Dream Evil", "All the fools sailed aw
EXTD=ay" and "Overlove", the rest sound half-baked. How could DIO ever
EXTD=conjure up a corny comic book character like SUNSET SUPERMAN???!
EXTD=! The beats on this song are good, but then it almost sounds like
EXTD=a pop-rock song with the "boom pah boom boom pah" beats over and
EXTD=over again. The saving grace is Dio's fierce baritone that put l
EXTD=ife into all the songs, even the corny ones. I bought this cos I 
EXTD=am a hardcore DIO fan, and it goes for the others too...buy it if
EXTD=you live, breathe and die by his name.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\nDio is Dio, November 14, 2000\nReviewer: Floyd's Garage "Ro
EXTD=ckin Guitar Player" (Jacksonville, NC]\nHey man I dig Dio. Loved 
EXTD=him in Sabbath, loved him in Rainbow, and loved him on his own. T
EXTD=his album goes a little overboard though. Last in Line and Holy D
EXTD=iver were great albums, but this one doesn't quite stand up to th
EXTD=ose two. Most Dio fans will agree that Ronnie James has a one tra
EXTD=ck mind. Very few of his songs DON'T contain the following words 
EXTD=Magic, Rainbow, Dark, Heart, or Evil. But hey, that's why we li
EXTD=sten to him.\nBest tunes are 'Fools sailed Away' and 'Could of be
EXTD=en a Dreamer'. The guitar riff on 'Sunset SuperMan' is amazing, b
EXTD=ut the lyrics are so stupid they take away from it. I could see t

EXTD=of the Best, May 9, 2000\nReviewer: Stephen Davis (West Virginia,
EXTD=United States]\nThis album represents Dio's most mature work to 
EXTD=date. The arrival of guitarist Craig Goldy ushered in a departure
EXTD=from the speed style playing of Vivian Campell, and introduced a
EXTD=more mature guitar style that is very pleasing to both professio
EXTD=nal musicians and lay music fans alike. The title track, as well 
EXTD=as, "All The Fools Sailed Away" are two of Dio's very best during
EXTD=his seemingly unending career. This is one of those rare albums 
EXTD=where every song is good and can be listened to. It has everythin
EXTD=g, from fast tempo tracks like "Night People" to heavy metal ball
EXTD=ads such as "Naked In The Rain" and "All The Fools Sailed Away." 
EXTD=All in all, one of his best.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nExcel
EXTD=lent Work, As Usual, December 19, 1999\nReviewer: AlucardDracula 
EXTD=(Owensville, MO]\nI must agree with several fellow reviewers on m
EXTD=any points. We cannot have more "Holy Diver" or "Last in Line" be
EXTD=cause those days are (*sniff*) gone forever into the spiraling vo
EXTD=rtex of the past. Never can we hope to regain that particular bra
EXTD=nd of musical genius because today's generation (of which I am as
EXTD=hamed to be a part) has no appreciation for the exceedingly emoti
EXTD=onal work of good metal. I would bet that every single band these
EXTD=days is a group of posers who claim to have been mistreated terr
EXTD=ibly in their childhood. I also find it laughable that the songs 
EXTD=they churn out are assembly-line productions with no imagination 
EXTD=whatsoever.\nOn to "Dream Evil," we again see yet another maturat
EXTD=ion process from Ronnie and Co. Losing Vivian Campbell to the lur
EXTD=es of David Coverdale's Whitesnake, the band rallied from the abs
EXTD=ence and produced a wonderfully planned, written, and arranged wo
EXTD=rk with some distinctly imaginative aspects. Of course, as Ms. Fr
EXTD=aser, the author of the editorial review, was correct in pointing
EXTD=out, Ronnie relied far too much on particular words and phrases.
EXTD=However, that is all part of Ronnie's personality, and no matter
EXTD=how you try, there is no possible way you may confuse this with 
EXTD=a lack of originality.\n\nRegarding Dio's recent work, only "Angr
EXTD=y Machines" deserves the criticism it receives from my comrade, A
EXTD=drian Ferenczy (DarknessPaladin@yahoo.com). All of his works from
EXTD="Lock up the Wolves" onward are excellent works of masterful art
EXTD=We can only hope that the trend continues because even when mus
EXTD=ical taste disappears completely down the toilet (as it already s
EXTD=eems to have), bands such as Dio, Black Sabbath, and others along
EXTD=the same line will always retain a loyal cadre of devoted fans.\n

EXTD=of how "Holy Diver" was Dio's greatest acomplishment..Now don't 
EXTD=get me wrong..it did start the trend..and has several good tracks
EXTD=on it..but I seem to be drawn to "Last in Line" over it..At any 
EXTD=rate..I see this album as Dio's first more modern sounding releas
EXTD=e..There isn't simply a weak track on it..true your taste may ver
EXTD=y from day to day..but the rythem guitars are wonderful..probably
EXTD=the only minor weakness is the lead guitar..wich is still very g
EXTD=ood and has lots of feeling..but all the same I can imagine solos
EXTD=with alot more depth in some places..In this writers opion this 
EXTD=is probably (Next to "Lock Up the Wolves") the best work Dio has
