EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This self-titled effort wasn't the Florida b
EXTD=and's first album (they'd recorded an underrated album in 1973 ti
EXTD=tled Do It Good), but it was the first K.C. collection to soar to
EXTD=the top of the charts. Fueled by such addictive funk hits as "Th
EXTD=at's the Way (I Like It)" and "Get Down Tonight," the album estab
EXTD=lished K.C. as one of the top stars of the disco era. But while K
EXTD=C. was labeled a disco artist, the truth is that many of these s
EXTD=lick yet gritty songs have more in common with the Ohio Players t
EXTD=han the Silver Convention or Donna Summer. When Rhino reissued th
EXTD=is album on CD in 1995 as KC and The Sunshine Band...And More, the 
EXTD=company generously included several early K.C. smokers (including
EXTD="I'm a Pushover") from Do It Good as bonus tracks. The invigorat
EXTD=ing material proves that even before the outfit hit big, its dist
EXTD=inctive sound had been established. ~ Alex Henderson\n\nAmazon.co

EXTD=eviewer: Reginald D. Garrard (Camilla, GA USA]\nThe album, in its

EXTD=zy 'bout this CD, April 13, 1999\nReviewer: A music fan\nWhat is 
EXTD=there not to like here? Fun lyrics, great horn playing, exciting 
EXTD=percussion, and heartfelt singing all add up to a great time. If 
EXTD=you're not smiling by the end of this, you'd better check your pu
EXTD=lse. Highlights other than the obvious hits that everyone's heard
EXTD=a million times include "I'm So Crazy," "I'm a Pushover" and "Le
EXTD=t it Go." And don't even get me started on "I Get Lifted" - that 
EXTD=song takes me to a whole other dimension. Hey Rhino, while you're
EXTD=at it, why not combine "Who Do Ya Love" and "Do You Wanna Go Par
