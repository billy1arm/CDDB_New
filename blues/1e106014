EXTD=The Best Of Tony Joe White featuring Polk Salad Annie\n© 1993 Warner Archives/Warner Bros. Records Inc.\n\nOriginally Released September 14, 1993 \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Twenty tracks from 1969-1973, the period of Tony Joe White's greatest success, 
EXTD=including "Polk Salad Annie" and White's own version of his composition "Rainy Night in Georgia." Most of this is quality swamp rock with pop-soul-conscious production - on cuts like "High Sheriff of Calhoun Parrish," it sounds very much like he was 
EXTD=trying to achieve a groove in the mold of Bobbie Joe Gentry's "Ode to Billie Joe." Sometimes he gets real down-home in a stomping backwoods blues style that makes him sound a little like a White counterpart to John Lee Hooker, as on "Stockholm Blues
EXTD=" If there's any criticism to be levied against this music, it's in its occasional lack of variety, White mining staple swamp rock boogie riffs for all they're worth. However, few, if any, performers and writers were as skilled as White in doing so

EXTD=s great unsung hero of modern music. White is truly an underrated musical genius who's down-home swampy soul and blues transports the listener to the heart of the deep South. Having written such well-defined rock and soul classics as "Polk Salad Ann
EXTD=ie", "Rainy Night In Georgia" and "Willie and Laura Mae Jones" to name a few, White has forged a name for himself primarily as an excellent songwriter. But he is little known and underappreciated as a great singer and performer whose deep, soulful voi

EXTD=Bob Cooney (Lookidat@aol.com) (Middletown, Pa.]\n\nTony Joe has one of the best country blues voices ever recorded. He also plays a nasty guitar and throws in tasty harp solos. I have no idea how the world missed out on this one-of-a kind musical ge
EXTD=nious. I bought this album from "Polk Salad Annie" popularity and got more than I expected. My favorite pick of the decade ! Wonderful honest writing, goodtime soulful performances. Buy it and fall in love with it !\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n
EXTD=Tony Joe White is the Man., February 26, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\nThis is a wonderful collection of fine songs and performances from a truly great artist. Tony Joe White can put a soulful mood on you faster and longer than anyone in the record busine
EXTD=ss. His swamp music is different and it's alive and it sticks all over you. He is the man. Be forewarned: After listening to this CD (and you will, over and over), you will want more of the Swamp Fox. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA REALLY GREAT
EXTD=ALBUM BY A MASTER!!!, May 7, 2007 \nBy  IAN BRUCE-DOUGLAS "AZLBRAX" (The Cat Farm, North Central Florida]\n\nFrom the moment I first heard "Polk Salad Annie", back in the late '60s, I became a Tony Joe White fan. It was really refreshing to hear a 
EXTD=fellow Southerner playing a style of music that was unique to my part of the world. Tony had real "Soul" without trying to be a Black wannabe. There were always elements of Country and Funk in his style but he combined them in an original way that o
EXTD=thers would only weakly imitate later. Sadly, after a couple of hits, he seemed to disappear and, frankly, I even forgot what his name was. Then, a few weeks ago someone mentioned him as an influence and it was like "Oh yeah: I remember him. He was 
EXTD=cool!" So, I ordered this album and my Yankee wife and I listened to it for the first time in my truck while we were making the weekly run into town to buy groceries and other supplies. My wife is too young to remember "Polk Salad Annie" but the min
EXTD=ute it came on, man, her head was bobbing and she got a big grin on her face...and she kept grinning and bobbing through the whole album! I had never heard most of the tunes in this collection but I wasn't disappointed by a single one! What's amazin
EXTD=g about Mr. White is that, while he writes, sings, plays the the guitar and harmonica adequately, he is not a virtuoso on any of them. Yet, when you take the sum total of one of his performances, he is really, really great! \n\nI guess the big surpr
EXTD=ise for me was "Ol' Mother Earth"! Who would have thought that an ol' Southern Boy would have written such a sensitive pro-environment tune. I must admit that it made my throat thicken up a little. Another extra good one was "Willy And Laura May Jon
EXTD=es": social commentary at its finest! \n\nThis is a great introductory album for those who are unfamiliar with Tony Joe's work...and just as great for those of us who are. \n\nI'm so happy to see that he's still around and still recording. I have al
EXTD=ready ordered more of his albums. \n\nI just hope that he tours in North Central Florida! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGood but not his best, August 21, 2000 \nBy  Kevin Moore (Lumsden, Saskatchewan Canada]\n\nThis is a CD that should be in mos
EXTD=t people's collection. If you can't have all of the earlier albums then this is a good sample. However as with any Greatest Hits CD's this one has some good stuff on it and some okay stuff on it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is
EXTD=missing some of the songs that more define TJW than some of these. Songs like "For Le Anne" or "The Father" or his great version of Dylan's "Copper Kettle". I was surprised that the title track, and one of his few instrumentals, "Home Made Ice Crea
EXTD=m" did not make the cut. That song is not only short but as TJW as you can get.\n\nIf you like his older material, especially the quieter songs, then check out his last 3-4 CD's which find him in a more mellow form. YEAR: 1973
