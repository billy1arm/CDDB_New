EXTD=MG EXPERT REVIEW:  (Box Sets) The Beatles always stood apart 
EXTD=from their peers, a self-evident statement that sadly extende
EXTD=d to the treatment of their catalog in the digital age. Where
EXTD=all their peers from the Byrds to the Who have had their cat
EXTD=alogs remastered and reissued in deluxe editions, sometimes s
EXTD=everal times, the Beatles remained stuck in the early days of
EXTD=digital, their 14 albums plus Past Masters singles collectio
EXTD=n remaining untouched since 1987. Anniversaries came and went
EXTD=, but no remasters arrived until the release of the video gam
EXTD=e The Beatles Rockband pushed a long-overdue revamping of the
EXTD=band's entire catalog into the stores on 9-9-09. This reissu
EXTD=e campaign corrects almost all the problems of the original 1
EXTD=987 CDs: the sound and artwork are improved, and all the orig
EXTD=inal mono and stereo mixes finally see the light of day. Natu
EXTD=rally, it's possible to quibble about some details of the pre
EXTD=sentation, particularly the decision to split the reissue int
EXTD=o two separate box sets, one covering the stereo mixes and on
EXTD=e the mono mixes, with only the stereo mixes available as ind
EXTD=ividual discs (it's still possible to complain that the album
EXTD=s do not add era-specific singles or outtakes, but such expan
EXTD=sions were never really in the cards), but both boxes still c
EXTD=onstitute the best Beatles by far. Crucially, it's also inarg
EXTD=uably the best-sounding Beatles music ever released, robust a
EXTD=nd rich even on the earliest rock and roll. None of the albums 
EXTD=have been remixed -- although Help! and Rubber Soul retain Ma
EXTD=rtin's 1987 mixes, the original stereo mixes are bonuses on t
EXTD=he mono set -- so this doesn't shock the way the Yellow Subma
EXTD=rine soundtrack did with its reimagined stereo mixes. Neverth
EXTD=eless, these remasters surely do surprise with their clarity 
EXTD=and depth, with each album feeling bigger and fuller than the
EXTD=previous CD incarnation, but not artificially so. It's not t
EXTD=hat these are pumped up on digital steroids - it's that the ve
EXTD=il has been lifted, so everything seems full and fresh. Appro
EXTD=priately, there's more to savor from Help! onward, as the Bea
EXTD=tles' productions grew ambitious, but Please Please Me, With 
EXTD=the Beatles, and A Hard Day's Night all have a strong punch, 
EXTD=while Beatles for Sale is warmer than the previous disc.\n\n(
EXTD=Stereo Box Set)  As a package, the stereo box is slightly unw
EXTD=ieldy -- it's a large, vertical set with two stacks of discs 
EXTD=in slick cardboard sleeves piled on top of each other. No ext
EXTD=ra book is included with the set, but each disc has its own b
EXTD=ooklet with dry, straightforward liner notes detailing the re
EXTD=cording process instead of analyzing the music. If anything a
EXTD=bout the set could be called disappointing, it's the mini-doc
EXTD=umentaries attached to each disc as Quicktime files and colle
EXTD=cted on a DVD bonus for the box. "Mini-documentary" may even 
EXTD=be stretching what these are: they're three to five infomerci
EXTD=als about the albums, not much more informative than the note
EXTD=s themselves. Nevertheless, these do offer annotation, someth
EXTD=ing sorely lacking from the first CDs, and they do replicate 
EXTD=the original notes -- in the case of Magical Mystery Tour, in
EXTD=cluding the entire storybook - in the case of Pepper, all the 
EXTD=20th anniversary annotation is added -- finally bringing the 
EXTD=Beatles to the same standard for reissues that every other ma
EXTD=jor (and most minor) bands have had for years now. And the st
EXTD=ory, at least for the stereo box, is not the packaging -- it'
EXTD=s the glorious sound that makes this such a treat. There's al
EXTD=so no question that those who waited 22 years to hear a bette
EXTD=r version of the Beatles will not be disappointed (although t
EXTD=hey may still wonder why it took so long for the Fabs to be t
EXTD=reated as they deserve).  \n\n(Mono Box Set)  The stereo set 
EXTD=may be the official canon, but what Beatlemaniacs have really
EXTD=craved is the mono box. This limited-edition box is laden wi
EXTD=th new-to-CD mixes, including the genuine rarities of the pre
EXTD=viously unreleased mono mixes of the four new songs from Yell
EXTD=ow Submarine, and its packaging is gorgeous, filled with mini
EXTD=LP replicas with stiff cardboard sleeves of every album from
EXTD=Please Please Me to The Beatles, complete with replicated ga
EXTD=tefolds and packaging inserts, all protected in resealable pl
EXTD=astic sleeves. As pure physical product, this satisfies any c
EXTD=ollector itch, but this also is arguably the better-sounding 
EXTD=of the two sets, providing ample evidence that the Beatles di
EXTD=d spend more time on mono mixes during much of their career. 
EXTD=For generations of listeners raised on stereo mixes, there ar
EXTD=e plenty of surprises here, from the faster versions of "She'
EXTD=s Leaving Home" and "Don't Pass Me By" to the numerous little
EXTD=differences that pop up on Pepper, The White Album, and Revo
EXTD=lver, all adding up to dramatically different experiences. So
EXTD=metimes, the density of mono just has more force -- "Lady Mad
EXTD=onna" rolls like a freight train, "I'm Down" hits to the gut 
EXTD=- and sometimes the colors just seem more vibrant - in either
EXTD=case, there's enough emotional difference to make this worth
EXTD=while for the dedicated, and depending on taste, it may even 
EXTD=be preferable. But there's no question of one thing: of the t
EXTD=wo sets, as a package, the mono box is a thing to behold. And
EXTD=there's also no question that those who waited 22 years to h
EXTD=ear a better version of the Beatles will not be disappointed 
EXTD=(although they may still wonder why it took so long for the F
EXTD=abs to be treated as they deserve). -- Stephen Thomas Erlewin
EXTD=e\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Released a mere eight months after
EXTD=their Please Please Me, With the Beatles is a sequel of the 
EXTD=highest order -- one that betters the original by developing 
EXTD=its own tone and adding depth. Make no mistake, With the Beat
EXTD=les is a significantly different record than its predecessor,
EXTD=even if it shares many similarities. There is an equal ratio
EXTD=of covers-to-originals (six to eight, to be precise), a fami
EXTD=liar blend of girl group, Motown, R&B, pop and rock influence
EXTD=s, a token song for Ringo and a showtune that interrupts the 
EXTD=flow of the album -- all things that it shares with Please Pl
EXTD=ease Me. Nevertheless, With the Beatles is a better, more var
EXTD=ied record that not only rocks harder, but boasts a sophistic
EXTD=ated set of originals that mark a significant leap forward fr
EXTD=om their promising debut. They could deliver rock and roll stra
EXTD=ight ("I Wanna Be Your Man," and arguably the finest showcase
EXTD=John and Paul ever created for Ringo) or twist it around wit
EXTD=h a little Latin lilt ("Little Child," andone of their most u
EXTD=nderrated early rockers) - Lennon and McCartney wrote sweet ball
EXTD=ads (the achingly gorgeous "All I've Got to Do") and sprightl
EXTD=y pop-rockers ("All My Loving") with equal aplomb - propulsive
EXTD=rockers ("It Won't Be Long") were as richly melodic as slowe
EXTD=r songs ("Not A Second Time"), possibly even moreso. Even Geo
EXTD=rge Harrison's first recorded song, "Don't Bother Me," andis 
EXTD=a stand-out, thanks to a wonderfully foreboding minor-key mel
EXTD=ody. Since the Beatles covered so much ground with their orig
EXTD=inals, their choice of covers can't help but pale somewhat in
EXTD=comparison, and they do. This time around, they unearthed on
EXTD=ly one forgotten gem ("Devil in Her Heart"), choosing to rely
EXTD=on familiar hits from both sides of the Atlantic. There's li
EXTD=ttle question that the songs are great, but there are no reve
EXTD=lations here as there were on Please Please Me and their perf
EXTD=ormances occasionally pale in comparison to the original. But
EXTD=for every "Roll Over Beethoven," anda surprisingly stiff rea
EXTD=ding of the Chuck Berry standard, there is a sublime moment, 
EXTD=such as Lennon's soaring interpretation of "You Really Got a 
EXTD=Hold On Me," and even on the relatively weaker numbers, the g
EXTD=roup turns in thoroughly enjoyable performances. Still, the h
EXTD=eart of With the Beatles lies not in the covers, but the orig
EXTD=inals, where it was clear that, even at this early stage, the
EXTD=Beatles were rapidly maturing and changing, turning into bot
EXTD=h expert craftsmen and musical innovators. -- Stephen Thomas 
EXTD=Erlewine\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nThey still had plent
EXTD=y of covers to fill out the running time, but the Lennon-McCa
EXTD=rtney writing team was gathering steam and beginning to knock
EXTD=out pop classics as if they were pulling them out of thin ai
EXTD=r. "All My Loving" and "I Wanna Be your Man" come from this r
EXTD=ecord, issued hurriedly to capitalize on English Beatlemania.
EXTD=But even when they were laying into some classic Chuck Berry
EXTD=, by this time the Beatles had acquired a unique sound in the
EXTD=blend of John's and Paul's voices, while George was coming o

EXTD=e employed, the Beatles' vigor and sense of purpose remained

EXTD=roup's own creations. WITH THE BEATLES freed artists to recor
EXTD=d their own material, and the course of pop was irrevocably c
EXTD=hanged.\n\n\nROLLING STONE REVIEW\n"It was twenty years ago t
EXTD=oday/Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play." That line has been
EXTD=invoked an awful lot this year, as Capitol Records has turne
EXTD=d the Greatest Album Ever into (Capitol says) "the most impor
EXTD=tant and revealing compact disc release there ever can be." B
EXTD=ut as the newly digitized Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Ba
EXTD=nd blares from CD players everywhere, it's worth recalling li
EXTD=nes from a less hallowed source, Blue Oyster Cult: "Things ai
EXTD=n't what they used to be/And this ain't the Summer of Love."
EXTD=\n\nNo, these are more sober and businesslike times, and the 
EXTD=1987 version of Pepper Fever is dramatically different from i
EXTD=ts 1967 precursor. Back then, the fever was a near-spontaneou
EXTD=s, overwhelming reaction to a groundbreaking album that unerr
EXTD=ingly captured and sealed the moment for a worldwide youth co
EXTD=mmunity. Today, the fuss over Sgt. Pepper is, above all, the 
EXTD=culmination of a carefully orchestrated, canny and lucrative 
EXTD=marketing campaign.\n\nCapitol Records has smartly turned its
EXTD=1987 series of Beatles reissues into an event. While ABKCO a
EXTD=nd Columbia dumped all the early Rolling Stones CDs onto the 
EXTD=market at once, giving all but the die-hards far too much to 
EXTD=choose from, Capitol has released the Beatles CDs in batches 
EXTD=small enough to lure many fans into buying everything. The la
EXTD=bel also guaranteed a publicity blitz by making sure Sgt. Pep
EXTD=per would hit the stores on June 1st, the twentieth anniversa
EXTD=ry of its original release.\n\nIt hasn't always been smooth s
EXTD=ailing with Capitol's marketing scheme. Aficionados protested
EXTD=the release of the first four records in mono, though Beatle
EXTD=s producer George Martin said that the first two were only av
EXTD=ailable in fake stereo versions that would have been far wors
EXTD=e. And more casual American fans may have been confused by th
EXTD=e albums themselves, since the CDs correspond to their Britis
EXTD=h rather than their far different American configurations. Fo
EXTD=r nostalgia's sake, it might have been nice to have, say, The
EXTD=Beatles' Second Album or Yesterday and Today on CD -- but th
EXTD=ose albums didn't exist in Great Britain, and it's pointless 
EXTD=to complain too loudly when the British LPs are longer and mo
EXTD=re intelligently compiled. (Still, the Beatles left many of t
EXTD=heir hit singles and standout tracks off the British albums, 
EXTD=so you won't find "I Want to Hold Your Hand," "She Loves You,
EXTD=" "We Can Work It Out," "Day Tripper" or several others on CD
EXTD=Capitol says it is going to release CD compilations with al
EXTD=l the missing songs, but then, some time ago, Capitol said it
EXTD=was going to standardize the Beatles' albums on both sides o
EXTD=f the Atlantic, and that never happened.]\n\nAlbum confusion 
EXTD=aside, the CDs have other problems. Up until Sgt. Pepper, the
EXTD=ir running time averages less than thirty-four minutes apiece
EXTD=, which means that two complete albums could easily fit on a 
EXTD=single disc, à la Motown's twofers series. Combining Beatles 
EXTD=albums would have cut Capitol's profits and, it could be argu
EXTD=ed, disrupted the integrity of the individual records. Still,
EXTD=Rubber Soul and Revolver on one disc would have been the CD 
EXTD=bargain of a lifetime.\n\nMeanwhile, the naturally brighter C
EXTD=D sound is also shriller and sometimes more grating, mostly o
EXTD=n the rock songs from Please Please Me and With the Beatles b
EXTD=ut to some degree on everything until Rubber Soul. The new te
EXTD=chnology adds some clarity, but it does far less for the Beat
EXTD=les than CDs have done for, say, Buddy Holly.\n\nCapitol clea
EXTD=rly wanted Sgt. Pepper ready by June 1st - it's possible the l
EXTD=abel was prepared to shortchange A Hard Day's Night and Beatl
EXTD=es for Sale to get there. Though the early CDs have variable 
EXTD=sound and occasionally shoddy packaging that crams the origin
EXTD=al LPs' photos and liner notes into inelegant graphic hodgepo
EXTD=dges, Sgt. Pepper gets the treatment that becomes a legend mo
EXTD=st: significantly improved sound, extensive liner notes, a tw
EXTD=enty-eight-page booklet. After all, wasn't Sgt. Pepper the Be
EXTD=atles' big event?\n\nWell, yes and no. Two decades ago, it se
EXTD=emed unquestionably the biggest and greatest album anybody ha
EXTD=d ever made - today, it doesn't even sound like the Beatles' b
EXTD=est record. Of course, it's hard to stand back and dispassion
EXTD=ately assess the Beatles' music: the pop revolution the group
EXTD=started may be two decades past, but it still claims virtual
EXTD=ly everyone over twenty-five, making it nearly impossible to 
EXTD=hear "I Saw Her Standing There" or "A Hard Day's Night" or "E
EXTD=ight Days a Week" -- or, hell, to even look at the cover of W
EXTD=ith the Beatles -- with anything approaching objectivity.\n\n
EXTD=In a way - it's startling that the music retains any freshness
EXTD=at all, twenty-odd years and countless elevator renditions l
EXTD=ater. But the key word may be effortless: the band worked har
EXTD=d -- on songs like "Tell Me Why" and "It Won't Be Long," as h
EXTD=ard as anybody in rock and roll, but the playing sounds natural
EXTD=, easy, enormously potent but completely unforced. And while 
EXTD=the early records are saddled with a few too many questionabl
EXTD=e cover versions (the Rolling Stones always had better taste 
EXTD=in outside material), there's an unstoppable momentum. Try Pl
EXTD=ease Please Me for the Beatles' unfettered joy at making musi
EXTD=c - With the Beatles for their growing toughness - A Hard Day's
EXTD=Night for the dazzling assurance of Lennon and McCartney's s
EXTD=ongs - Help! for the relatively quiet and understated way in w
EXTD=hich they consolidated their strengths.\n\nAfter that, the Be
EXTD=atles got "mature": less adrenaline, more subtlety. And Capit
EXTD=ol got serious. Though the digital transfer doesn't make this
EXTD=astonishingly rich batch of songs any better, the remixed Ru
EXTD=bber Soul CD shows more signs of tinkering than the earlier r
EXTD=eleases: balances are changed, background parts made louder, 
EXTD=John's intake of breath in "Girl" becomes far more prominent.
EXTD=Just as the recording technology got more sophisticated with
EXTD=Rubber Soul and Revolver, those albums' CDs sound fuller and
EXTD=cleaner (though Revolver wasn't digitally remixed, unlike He
EXTD=lp! and Rubber Soul).\n\nThen, Sgt. Pepper. As a collection o
EXTD=f pop songs, it's no match for its two predecessors: "Girl" a
EXTD=nd "For No One" are timeless - "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
EXTD=and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite" are inescapably tied
EXTD=to their times. But as a cultural artifact, as a benchmark o
EXTD=f its era, as an instant passage to the first Summer of Love,
EXTD=nothing else comes close. Few things are sadder than a once-
EXTD=revolutionary work whose bite has been eroded by time, but Sg
EXTD=t. Pepper survives because it's also a fun, playful, ambitiou
EXTD=s record, a mannered but terrific collection of songs with hi
EXTD=ghlights as devastating as "A Day in the Life."\n\nIt's also 
EXTD=the kind of record that seems to have been designed for compa
EXTD=ct disc, full of sonic showcases like "Lovely Rita" and "Bein
EXTD=g for the Benefit of Mr. Kite." This album, clearly, was tran
EXTD=sferred to CD as carefully as some of the others should have 
EXTD=been: though tape hiss shows up in a few places, on the whole
EXTD=Sgt. Pepper gains a clarity and vividness the vinyl version 
EXTD=simply doesn't have.\n\nBut if it whips up the same sort of h
EXTD=ysteria the album prompted two decades ago, it'll mean that t
EXTD=oday's classic-rock, "music for the Big Chill generation" men
EXTD=tality is more dangerous and out of control than we ever imag
EXTD=ined. The Beatles CDs are fun, expensive, occasionally revela
EXTD=tory -- and, for Capitol Records, highly profitable -- ways f
EXTD=or us to hear some of the best rock ever recorded without the
EXTD=clicks, pops and scratches that most of our Beatles albums h
EXTD=ave accumulated through the years. But to turn them into more
EXTD=than that is a mistake. That was twenty years ago, after all
EXTD=, and this ain't the Summer of Love.  (Posted: Jul 16, 1987)

EXTD=\nA Cheapskate's (Relatively) Guide To The Mono and Stereo Re
EXTD=Issues, 09.10.2009 \nBy  James N. Perlman\n\nIntroduction: T
EXTD=he following is pretty much a full review of both the mono an
EXTD=d stereo reissues largely written in real time as a series of
EXTD=e-mails to an old friend who once owned a legendary record s
EXTD=tore here in Chicago. The story of the reissues really comes 
EXTD=down to the technical limitations of two-track, four-track, e
EXTD=ight-track, etc. recordings and the relative complexity of th
EXTD=e music of the Beatles. Listening occurred on what would be c
EXTD=onsidered an audiophile system with Quad 988's as the speaker
EXTD=s. \n\nPlease Please Me: The sound on the mono is just amazin
EXTD=g. You can hear the echo in the room as John sings Anna. The 
EXTD=vocals just soar. Ringo was just so good, even at this early 
EXTD=stage and so was Paul. They supported and framed the songs so
EXTD=perfectly. And just think, in twenty-one minutes, or so, Twi
EXTD=st And Shout! Stereo can't hold a candle to this, if for no o
EXTD=ther reason than the left/right "stereo" found later in With 
EXTD=The Beatles, Rubber Soul and Revolver. \n\nWith The Beatles: 
EXTD=As with Please Please Me, the mono sounds so, so, nice. As th
EXTD=e stereo has that annoying left/right "stereo," no contest: m
EXTD=ono hands down. \n\nA Hard Day's Night: Seems better and more
EXTD=enjoyable in stereo. I think the reason is that they now had
EXTD=four tracks so George Martin could do proper stereo mixes an
EXTD=d still have a mostly fresh first generationish sound. Rememb
EXTD=er, there were only two track available for Please Please Me.
EXTD=However, when they got to Rubber Soul and Revolver, four tra
EXTD=cks weren't enough, which required, in some instances, numero
EXTD=us dubs of the four tracks to another four track tape, mergin
EXTD=g the four tracks to one track, thereby opening up three new 
EXTD=tracks. While this degraded the sound somewhat it also made i
EXTD=t difficult to back-track and do the after-thought stereo mix
EXTD=es, which is why we have the atrocious "stereo" of Rubber Sou
EXTD=l and Revolver. Consequently, the reason the monos of these a
EXTD=lbums rule has mostly to do with technical limitations. While
EXTD=the mixes on A Hard Day's Night are true stereo mixes, they 
EXTD=carry George Martin's idiosyncratic, but really right, decisi
EXTD=on to put the vocals in the center, the rhythm section to the
EXTD=left and the other instruments to the right. I always have l
EXTD=oved how Martin took care to isolate the brilliant work of Ri
EXTD=ngo and Paul so many times instead of just following the conv
EXTD=ention of placing the drums in the center. This is why one of
EXTD=Martin's memoirs is entitled: "All You Need Is Ears." \\\\\\
EXTD=\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe Beatles For Sale: Comments, preference and 
EXTD=reasons for preference similar to A Hard Day's Night. \n\nHel
EXTD=p: Well, thank God we have three different versions to compar
EXTD=e to make life ever so easy. First, mono is the definitive mi
EXTD=x, that's a plus. As a minus, while it sounds richer, it is a
EXTD=lso a bit muddy compared to the stereo mixes. As for the ster
EXTD=eo mixes, the remaster of George Martin's '87 remix does show
EXTD=some limiting in this new incarnation. A bit a hard to dial 
EXTD=in the right volume. Sounds fuller, but that's the limiting. 
EXTD=Not sure I care for this version too much. As for the '65 ste
EXTD=reo version, that comes on the same disc as the mono version,
EXTD=as this album is somewhat acoustic, the absence of the limit
EXTD=ing that was done to the new stereo remix/remaster is a plus.
EXTD=The delicacy is there in I Need You. Overall, the "old" ster
EXTD=eo is prettier than the "new" stereo. One can argue over whet
EXTD=her the "new" stereo or the ""old" stereo is better, I come d
EXTD=own on the side of the "old" stereo, I like pretty. But as yo
EXTD=u get both the mono and the "old" stereo on the single mono d
EXTD=isc, the cheapskate in me screams if you had a pistol to your
EXTD=head and only had to purchase one version of Help, it would 
EXTD=be the "mono" disc. \n\nRubber Soul: Mono over stereo, if for
EXTD=no other reason than the left/rt channel mix that plagued Pl
EXTD=ease, Please Me, With The Beatles and Revlover. \n\nRevolver:
EXTD=There is a section of Run For You Life where Ringo is just s
EXTD=o muscular and explosive in the mono that is missing in stere
EXTD=o and this is before we get to the issue of the left/right "s
EXTD=tereo" of the stereo mix. Plus, there is just this overall ri
EXTD=chness of sound to the mono that is missing in the stereo. Th
EXTD=at said, it is a bit cooler to hear Tomorrow Never Knows in s
EXTD=tereo. But, overall, mono. \n\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Cl
EXTD=ub Band: The things you have heard are correct about the mono
EXTD=mix, the clarity and control over the notes, instruments and
EXTD=vocals is all there. Overall, it just sounds better, fuller 
EXTD=and richer than the stereo, plus it is what the boys intended
EXTD=Oddly, the thing that was most breathtaking was She's Leavi
EXTD=ng Home - just a full, gorgeous, sound. In stereo, it just sou
EXTD=nds relatively wrong - thin compared to the mono. That said, b
EXTD=ecause Day In The Life is such a mind-f the stereo is the def
EXTD=initive version of this song. \n\nMagical Mystery Tour: While
EXTD=Pepper's sounded better in Mono, MMT sounds better in stereo
EXTD=\n\nThe Beatles (The White Album): Both versions have their
EXTD=merits, you need both. If you can only go for one, it's the 
EXTD=stereo. \n\nAbbey Road: The defining moment of these reissues
EXTD=, and why it took four years, may be found on AR's I Want You
EXTD=(She's So Heavy). Because they couldn't take the tape hiss o
EXTD=ut without compromising the sound, they didn't. But when it c

EXTD=and clipped previously, they were able to take the clipping

EXTD=tish Stereo pressing, following posting this review I went ov
EXTD=er there to compare the original vinyl with the two new CD re
EXTD=issues. We listened to the reference system, Naim Audio elect
EXTD=ronic and Quad speakers. There was total agreement on what we
EXTD=heard. First, Pepper's mono CD had better tonal balance than
EXTD=Peppers stereo CD. Pepper's stereo CD had better coloration 
EXTD=than the mono, but this was defeated by the harshness of the 
EXTD=sound (more on harshness shortly). Thus, overall, between the
EXTD=two CD's we preferred the mono CD. All that said, the stereo
EXTD=original British vinyl pressing crushed both. It had both to
EXTD=nal correctness and coloration. \nNow as to the harshness iss
EXTD=ue, please be mindful that I have listened to these discs on 
EXTD=two audiophile systems. Something like harshness is likely to
EXTD=be more prevalent the higher up you get in the stereo food c
EXTD=hain. Thus, someone who doesn't have an audiophile system may
EXTD=not experience the harshness at all, but it really is there.
EXTD=This may render some of the stereo CDs more listenable for t
EXTD=hese people than they were for me, at least when it comes to 
EXTD=Pepper's. \n\n9/12/09 THANKS TO ALL: The past few days, follo

EXTD=ON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nCould've used a butcher's knife...., 
EXTD=March 29, 2005 \nBy  Greg Brady "columbusboy" \n\nLooking at 
EXTD=the track lineup for this CD, a younger (American) fan might 
EXTD=wonder WHY the mop-tops were such a big deal in 1963? (They o
EXTD=wned all top 5 chart positions in the U.S. at one point that 
EXTD=year.) The answer is that the American label, Capitol, had "c
EXTD=hopped up" several British Parlophone Beatles releases and de
EXTD=veloped their own album called "Meet the Beatles" which inclu
EXTD=ded "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and all-time rock classic "I S
EXTD=aw Her Standing There" and left off 5 of the cover songs that
EXTD=appear here. It made for a much stronger album than the Brit
EXTD=ish version you get here. Also keep in mind that strong singl
EXTD=es like "She Loves You" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" were r
EXTD=eleased that year in the U.S. but never placed on album. \n\n
EXTD=In fact, I'd argue that even compared against "Please Please 
EXTD=Me" (the U.K. premiere LP) this is a step BACKWARDS for the b
EXTD=and. Like the first one, there are 8 originals, but the stron
EXTD=gest Beatle penned tune here is "It Won't Be Long", which mak
EXTD=es for a decent opening track but not anywhere as explosive a
EXTD=s "I Saw Her Standing There" was. "All My Loving" is a good m
EXTD=idtempo Paul number but not really a "classic" from him. "All
EXTD=I've Got to Do" is probably one of the weakest Lennon/McCart
EXTD=ney tunes until the "White Album" era. And once again, they'v
EXTD=e included Motown covers that compare unfavorably with the or
EXTD=iginals (The Beatles, at least at this point, did not have pa
EXTD=rticularly "soulful" vocals. Their version of "Money" doesn't
EXTD=stack up to Barrett Strong's. The backing vocals on "You'Ve 
EXTD=Really Got a Hold on Me" are terrible. The best cover, "Roll 
EXTD=Over Beethoven", is only average.) \n\nOn the good side, the 
EXTD=show tune done here (Paul's vocal on "Till There Was You") is
EXTD=done in a good arrangement that works for the band and in th
EXTD=is regard it's better than last CD's "A Taste of Honey". "I W
EXTD=anna Be Your Man" and "Little Child" are good, if not great, 
EXTD=Lennon/McCartney originals. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: This is a band o
EXTD=n the cusp of something great. They've given hints of it here
EXTD=and there. But it's not until the 3rd CD that the group magi
EXTD=c kicks in. \n\nThe Beatles may have hated how Capitol change
EXTD=d their track lineups (the famous "butcher cover" where the B
EXTD=oys are covered in bloody meat and chopped up doll parts was 
EXTD=their protest at how the label spliced and diced their track 
EXTD=lineups) but at least here the cigar chompers were right. You
EXTD='ll want it eventually, but I wouldn't make this the first on
EXTD=e you buy from the "suit years". YEAR: 1963
