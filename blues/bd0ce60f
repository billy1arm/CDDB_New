EXTD=Windham Hill Records, 01934-11290-2 YEAR: 1998
EXTT0=The Taylor Guitar is a beautiful instrument and I wanted to crea
EXTT0=te a song that showcased that balanced sound of it. When writing
EXTT0=the song for this record, I wanted to create a song that captur
EXTT0=ed a stereo sound and feel while only using one guitar, and I th
EXTT0=ink Larry's Worls does that. 
EXTT1=In the summer of 1997, a year passed since the loss of a good fr
EXTT1=iend and fellow musician Marcel Dadi on TWA's flight 800. Follow
EXTT1=ing a memorial service in Marcel's honor at the CAAS convention 
EXTT1=(Chet Atkins appreciation society), I was approached by the CAAS
EXTT1=president, Dr. Mark Pritcher and Pierre Danieloube of France. T
EXTT1=he two were complementing my daughter Haley and I on our perform
EXTT1=ance and participation in giving a few words about Marcel as ath
EXTT1=e concert came to a close. Apologetically I added, "Thanks but n
EXTT1=othings good enough for a friend like Marcel." Pierre responsed 
EXTT1=without hesitiation, grabbing my arm," No Doyle, you see, nothin
EXTT1=gs too good for a friend."
EXTT2=This is a Jerry Reed/Chet Atkins song that most guitar players h
EXTT2=ave aspired to play. I decided, due my own limitations, that I w
EXTT2=ould attempt to play the arrangment in its simplest form.
EXTT3=Java man was written after I watched a documentary about Indones
EXTT3=ia. At one point the narrator mentioned early Java man. This str
EXTT3=uck a chord into my head, and I started striking my guitar until
EXTT3=the tune came out.. (No coffee metaphor here) To me, Java Man r
EXTT3=epresents man's ability to consciously evolve. I dedicate this m
EXTT3=usic to Dr. Janet M. Ross
