EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  The Eurythmics' breakthrough album is a def
EXTD=t mix of electronic thrills, new wave chills, and sultry R&B, the
EXTD=latter supplied by Annie Lennox's warm tenor. Pretty much relyin
EXTD=g on themselves, Lennox and Dave Stewart slip past the music's us
EXTD=ual coldness and into a territory all their own. It can be smug (
EXTD=the new wave here is served with a side of irony) and a tad dull 
EXTD=(the long, operatic pieces serve little purpose), but the payoffs
EXTD=- "Love Is a Stranger" and, especially, the magnificent title t
EXTD=une -- are among the finest the genre has to offer.   -- Michael

EXTD=nd guitarist Dave Stewart first received notice in the Tourists, 
EXTD=who scored a big U.K. hit in 1979 with a cover of Dusty Springfie
EXTD=ld's "I Only Want to Be with You." Emerging as the Eurythmics in 
EXTD=1981, Lennox's cabaret-tinged vocal style and Stewart's left-of-c
EXTD=enter songs took a while to mesh, but when they finally did, with
EXTD=the haunting, hook-filled 1983 No. 1 single, "Sweet Dreams" (acc

EXTD=ound themselves rocketing to stardom. This, their second album, a

EXTD=is the word, December 14, 2005 \nBy  Philip A.Cohen (Bay Harbor I
EXTD=slands, Florida United States]\nAfter 26 months of cancelled rele
EXTD=ase dates, the expanded/remastered Eurythmics CD series is finall
EXTD=y here, and for those of you who want all 8 titles, the UK/Europe
EXTD="Boxed" set is the cheapest way to get them.  The CDs more than 
EXTD=live up to expectations, with excellent sound, three-panel cardbo
EXTD=ard packaging (each with a side pocket for an attractive and info
EXTD=rmative booklet), and a very sturdy outer box.  The bonus tracks 
EXTD=are a combination of non-L.P. b-sides, original 12" dance remixes
EXTD=by the artists themselves, some unreleased songs and versions (inc
EXTD=luding cover versions of tracks by Lou Reed, Thunderclap Newman, 
EXTD=The Doors, The Beatles and French Chanteuse Francoise Hardy), and 2
EXTD=later 1990's re-mixes by independant remixers (they're not bad).
EXTD=Unless you were an avid collector of the group's UK 7", 12" and  
EXTD=CD singles, all of the bonus material will be new to your collect
EXTD=ion.  However, these discs (packed as they are with bonus tracks)
EXTD=only get about half of the group's vinyl-only songs and versions
EXTD=onto CD.  Presumably, there will be some future archival box to 
EXTD=get the remaining tracks onto CD.  Amazon.com seems to be having 
EXTD=exceptional difficulty obtaining or supplying this set to custome
EXTD=rs, but let there be no doubt: it was released in the UK and Europe
EXTD=November 14,2005, and widely advertised in UK music magazines by
EXTD=the manufacturer (BMG/Sony), whose advertisements specifically s
EXTD=tated a Nov.14,2005 release date.  If you can't get it here, then
EXTD=try record stores in England (as I did).  The set is worth your 
EXTD=extra effort to obtain it.  Amazon was asking me to approve a sec
EXTD=ond shipping postponement (until late January 2006).  I declined,
EXTD=and obtained the set quite easily elsewhere.  Amazon did some st
EXTD=range things, pretending that the set hadn't been released, tempo
EXTD=rarily removing customer reviews of the set, and stopping the mar
EXTD=ketplace merchants from offering the set (as they had been). \n\n

EXTD=ng, January 6, 2006 \nBy  Danielik (Paris, France]\nThe box is ve
EXTD=ry nice and I agree with other positive comments on Amazon. Howev
EXTD=er, I want to stress my deception in seeing that "1984 - For the 
EXTD=love of big brother" is NOT included in the box. It is a wonderfu
EXTD=l album (released under a different label) and certainly I expect
EXTD=ed to find it in such a collection. \n\nAnother missing point is:

EXTD=D is. After this album they started doing more genre pieces and t
EXTD=heir albums seemed like (fantastic) singles plus filler--there's 
EXTD=no overall mood. But on this one, after the silly cover of "Wrap 
EXTD=It Up," the kind of thing they couldn't get enough of later on, i
EXTD=t moves into this gorgeous stretch that is unbroken through the a
EXTD=mazing "This City Never Sleeps." It's like Sade meets Nico or som
EXTD=ething, and notably lo-fi, in a cool way. After all these years o
EXTD=f "Missionary Man" and "Diva" and all that big pop stuff, which i
EXTD=s great but kinda blowsy, the sustained late-night mystery of thi

EXTD=remastered albums were under the supervision of Dave Stewart pain
EXTD=stakingly using the original masters. \n\nThe sound quality has i
EXTD=mproved but what happened to Sweet Dreams?  The version you hear 
EXTD=is edited down to barely over three minutes, I would expect to he
EXTD=ar the full version after plucking down $14.98. \n\nThe Eurythmic
EXTD=s Greatest Hits that came out about ten year ago has full length 
EXTD=versions but the sound quality is not as good. \n\nSo in conclusi

EXTD=5 \nBy  J. Brady (PAWLEYS ISLAND, SC United States]\n"Sweet Dream
EXTD=s" is one of my favourite Eurythmics releases and I've been waiti
EXTD=ng a very long time for the reissue of the back catalogue. I got 
EXTD=my hands on this the day it was released and here's my take on it
EXTD=The remastering is pristine. The expanded liner notes are a lit
EXTD=tle spare on information ( and there are no lyrics, which the ori
EXTD=ginal cd release did have ) but contain a wealth of unseen photog
EXTD=raphs. But as others have noted, there are many B-sides missing h
EXTD=ere. I thought that what "bonus" was all about. It is nice, howev
EXTD=er, to see the B-Side "Monkey Monkey" finally on CD, despite the 
EXTD=fact that it was mastered from a vinyl source ( I can hear the po
EXTD=ps and clicks at the begining of the song, and it is all mid-rang
EXTD=e, with hardly any bass or treble in the mix. ) Most disappointin
EXTD=g are the 1991 remixes of "Love Is A Stranger" and the title trac
EXTD=k. They are very badly dated - I would have preferred the original
EXTD=12" mixes. Get this one for the terrific sound upgrade, but bewa
EXTD=re a few of the other Eurythmics reissues - they are a spotty lot

EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nAn 80s Masterpiece, October 22, 2
EXTD=004 \nBy  D. Aaron Howard "rawherbivore" (San Diego, CA]\nAfter a
EXTD=rocky start in the late 70s and early 80s, the Eurythmics focuse
EXTD=d all of their talent and experience to produce the defining mome
EXTD=nt of their career. The most memorable point in this moment was t
EXTD=he video for "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)." During the baby s
EXTD=tages for MTV, most of the videos were cheesey and embarrassing. 
EXTD=A few artists were so cool, though, that they stood out among the
EXTD=rest. The Eurythmics were one of those - they truly raised the st
EXTD=andards for making videos. \n\nBeyond the videos, the music on th
EXTD=is album is what's really important. With "Sweet Dreams" and "Lov
EXTD=e Is A Stranger," Annie's bitterness about love is surrounded by 
EXTD=Dave's pulsating synthetic beats and soft, dissonant laser chimes
EXTD=By just listening to these two songs, one would think that the 
EXTD=Eurythmics had become a full-fledged New Wave synth band - and the
EXTD=re are certainly other songs on here to appease that taste ("I've
EXTD=Got an Angel," "I Could Give You A Mirror"). But, the band refus
EXTD=es to be categorized. Several songs are textured by Dave's sleek 
EXTD=guitar licks, adding some blues ("Wrap It Up") and even a tinge o
EXTD=f latin ("This Is the House"). \n\nFrom beginning to end, "Sweet 
EXTD=Dreams" flexes its muscles and relaxes, then flexes again and fin
EXTD=ally sighs with the brilliant "This City Never Sleeps." In fact, 
EXTD=there is not a dull moment on this recording. While most of the a
EXTD=lbums from the eighties New Wave craze have dated and fallen into
EXTD=novelty, "Sweet Dreams" will remain one of the definitive albums
EXTD=of the genre and decade. Truly a one-of-a-kind Masterpiece! \n\n

EXTD=ics album., June 6, 2002 \nBy  Thomas K. Dye (Richmond, CA]\nEver
EXTD=ything after this album couldn't capture the heights of this one.
EXTD=Annie's lyrics are beautifully minimalist ice sculptures: "I've 
EXTD=Got An Angel" suggests there's more to this story than Annie's le
EXTD=tting on with her three lines of lyric. In the meantime, "I Could
EXTD=Give You A Mirror" is a frenetic desire to break the ice and onl
EXTD=y finding more. The production is fabulous-- lots of bass, lots o
EXTD=f texture. Sad, lush epics like "Jennifer" are enhanced by Dave's
EXTD=moody guitar solo at the end - "This City Never Sleeps" creates a
EXTD=soporific soundscape of metropolitan lethargy and of course, the
EXTD=title track says the basic message of it all: "Some of them want
EXTD=to use you, some of them want to get used by you." All in all, a
EXTD=hard act to follow. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSynthpop M

EXTD=rg]\nEurythmics followed up the fragile and dream-like In the Gar
EXTD=den with this album of pure pop genius. The early 1980s saw an ex

EXTD=its instrumental flourishes and its melancholy mood. It's true th
EXTD=at not every single track on the original remains as memorable as
EXTD=the ones mentioned, but the album certainly deserves five stars 
EXTD=for its melodic and lyrical beauty, especially with the added son

EXTD=ng Home Is Where The Heart Is, the Hot Remix of Sweet Dreams (Are
EXTD=Made Of This), the Coldcut Remix of Love Is A Stranger and this 
EXTD=awesome rendition of Lou Reed's Satellite of Love that in its voc
