EXTD=REVIEW:  By the time of this album's release, Jeremy Spencer had 
EXTD=been replaced by Bob Welch and Christine McVie had begun to asser
EXTD=t herself more as a singer and songwriter. The result is a distin
EXTD=ct move toward folk-rock and pop - Future Games sounds almost noth
EXTD=ing like Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. Welch's eight-minute title 
EXTD=track has one of his characteristic haunting melodies, and with p
EXTD=runing and better editing, it could have been a hit. Christine Mc
EXTD=Vie's "Show Me a Smile" is one of her loveliest ballads. Initial 
EXTD=popular reaction was mixed: the album didn't sell as well as Kiln
EXTD=House, but it sold better than any of the band's first three alb
EXTD=ums in the U.S. In the U.K., where the original lineup had been m

EXTD=as that great band featuring the etheral Stevie Nicks with such

EXTD=but they don't realize that this band has been around since th

EXTD=individual lives and relationships. "Future Games" came out in 1
EXTD=971 and featured a new promising yet risky line-up. In my opinion
EXTD=, this is Fleetwood Mac's best line-up because the work they put 
EXTD=forth (up until 1974) was clever, unique, talented, enjoyable and
EXTD=overall special. Bob Welch was a perfect frontman for the band, 
EXTD=bridging the gap between blues, soul, jazz and R&B .... which bro

EXTD=virtual hypnosis with his laid-back but peppy piece which is the 
EXTD=title track. The band also showed themselves to have a great flai

EXTD=971, January 14, 2006 \nBy  Peter Baklava (Charles City, Iowa]\n\n
EXTD="Future Games" is a moody aquarelle of an album, coming on the he
EXTD=els of several boisterous, hard-rocking and bloozy efforts by the
EXTD=band originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac". \n\nWith P
EXTD=eter Green and Jeremy Spencer gone, the airbrushed lyricism of Da
EXTD=nny Kirwan, Christine McVie, and Bob Welch came to the fore. The 
EXTD=laid-back, distinctly feminine turn in "Future Games" was a forer
EXTD=unner of the Buckingham-Nicks era. Still, Danny Kirwan was mindfu
EXTD=l of the Mac traditions up to this point, and he retained the loo
EXTD=se, jamming feel that typified the preceding albums, "Then Play O
EXTD=n" and "Kiln House". 1972's "Bare Trees" completed the turn away 
EXTD=from jamming and into the pop song format. \n\n"Future Games" was
EXTD=a disappointment to kids (like myself at the time) who wanted ad
EXTD=renaline-boosting rock and roll. Instead, "Future Games" offered 
EXTD=a low-key, mellow mix ideal for winding down. In 1971, Rock music
EXTD=didn't really have a lot to offer women, but I remember that the
EXTD=ladies loved this album to pieces. Christine McVie's musical ple
EXTD=a to "take everything easy" was a soothing balm for women frazzle
EXTD=d by their boyfriends' screeching hard rock collections. \n\nThis
EXTD=album enhanced (if that's the right word) a lot of relationships
EXTD=It offered a breezy intimacy and polished warmth, and it brings
EXTD=back a nice feeling of carefree times, good friendships, and rel

EXTD=Jeremy Spencer was added and the group released its first album
EXTD=, which was traditional blues. The band added a third guitarist, 
EXTD=Danny Kirwan and did some major exploration in the blues, coming 
EXTD=to Chicago to play with traditional blues legends. This band rele
EXTD=ased 2 more albums. Later albums were released of the Chicago ses
EXTD=sions. \n\nPeter Green left the band (mostly because of drugs and
EXTD=insanity). Christine (Perfect) McVie joined the band for the nex
EXTD=t album (Kiln House), although she wasn't an official member. Con
EXTD=trary to what others have said, Kiln House was the big transforma
EXTD=tion of Fleetwood Mac from a blues band to a pop/rock band, not F
EXTD=uture Games. Jeremy Spencer left after the Kiln House tour. \n\nF
EXTD=uture Games is the first album to feature Bob Welch. He quickly b
EXTD=ecame the leader of the band (and Danny Kirwin left after the tou
EXTD=r for this album). \n\nAfter Future Games, Fleetwood Mac would pu
EXTD=t out 4 more albums before Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks wo
EXTD=uld join, turning this into the one of the most popular bands of 
EXTD=all time. All five of those albums are very good, featuring some 
EXTD=great songs. \n\nAfter Bare Trees was released, Fleetwood Mac tou
EXTD=red with Savoy Brown and Long John Baldry (I got to see them in a
EXTD=high school gym). After the tour, Fleetwood Mac stole Savoy Brow
EXTD=n's lead singer and Baldry's guitarist. The guitarist started foo
EXTD=ling around with Mick Fleetwood's wife, which caused the band to 
EXTD=break up for awhile. The record company put together a fake band 
EXTD=to complete a concert tour. The real group got a court injunction
EXTD=to stop the fake band, and then went on tour again to repair the
EXTD=ir reputation. \n\nIf you like expansive, rich songs, than you mi
EXTD=ght like this album. If you like short pop tunes or traditional b
EXTD=lues, you might not. To me, this album seems timeless, where as t
EXTD=he other Fleetwood Mac albums from this time, Kiln House and Bare

EXTD=s songs are the best here, especially the excellent "Sands Of Tim
