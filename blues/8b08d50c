EXTD=s Eric Clapton's first fully realized album as a blues guitarist 
EXTD=- more than that, it was a seminal blues album of the 1960s, per
EXTD=haps the best British blues album ever cut, and the best LP ever 
EXTD=recorded by John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Standing midway between 
EXTD=Clapton's stint with the Yardbirds and the formation of Cream, th
EXTD=is album featured the new guitar hero on a series of stripped-dow
EXTD=n blues standards, Mayall pieces, and one Mayall/Clapton composit
EXTD=ion, all of which had him stretching out in the idiom for the fir
EXTD=st time in the studio. This album was the culmination of a very s
EXTD=uccessful year of playing with John Mayall, a fully realized blue
EXTD=s creation, featuring sounds very close to the group's stage perf
EXTD=ormances, and with no compromises. Credit has to go to producer M
EXTD=ike Vernon for the purity and simplicity of the record - most Brit
EXTD=ish producers of that era wouldn't have been able to get it recor
EXTD=ded this way, much less released. One can hear the very direct in
EXTD=fluence of Buddy Guy and a handful of other American bluesmen in 
EXTD=the playing. And lest anyone forget the rest of the quartet: futu
EXTD=re pop/rock superstar John McVie and drummer Hughie Flint provide
EXTD=a rock-hard rhythm section, and Mayall's organ playing, vocalizi
EXTD=ng, and second guitar are all of a piece with Clapton's work. His
EXTD=guitar naturally dominates most of this record, and he can also 
EXTD=be heard taking his first lead vocal, but McVie and Flint are jus
EXTD=t as intense and give the tracks an extra level of steel-strung t
EXTD=ension and power, none of which have diminished across several de
EXTD=cades. [In 1998, Polygram Records issued a remastered version of 
EXTD=this album on CD, featuring both the stereo and mono mixes of the
EXTD=original tracks and new notes.]  -- Bruce Eder\n\n\nAMG EXPERT R
EXTD=EVIEW:  Rarely has any single record album induced such a shift i
EXTD=n popular music. Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton not only catapu
EXTD=lted Clapton to the helm of the burgeoning British blues-rock sce
EXTD=ne, it likewise made significant noise on the other side of the A
EXTD=tlantic -- where the blues had literally been born, bred, and but
EXTD=tered. This remastered and revisited edition boasts significantly
EXTD=upgraded sound quality for not only the dozen sides that compris
EXTD=e the original program, but also the bonus tracks. These two addi
EXTD=tional performances include the A- and B-sides of a rare 45 that 
EXTD=Mayall and Clapton cut for producer Mike Vernon's Purdah label ne
EXTD=arly a year before recording this disc. Taking a page from the mi
EXTD=d-'50s Miles Davis Quintet, it became obvious for those involved 
EXTD=that the best way to approach making a studio recording was to do
EXTD=cument the same material that was concurrently being performed by
EXTD=the band night after night in various London area clubs. In addi
EXTD=tion to Mayall (guitar/vocals) and Clapton (guitar/vocals), this 
EXTD=incarnation of the Blues Breakers utilizes the talents of John Mc
EXTD=Vie (bass) and Hughie Flint (drums). As a combo, this band was ab
EXTD=le to reinvent the American blues for a fresh audience whose ulti
EXTD=mate response would give rise to subgenres such as heavy metal an
EXTD=d other roots-related rock. While their contributions prove immea
EXTD=surable, they are likewise sadly eclipsed by that of Clapton. In 
EXTD=retrospect -- unlike many of the other revolutionary changes occu
EXTD=rring in pop music circa the mid-'60s -- the Blues Breakers are i
EXTD=nfinitely more subtle in their attack. Their most obvious weapon 
EXTD=is the advantage of documenting in-the-studio material from their
EXTD=live performance set. The Blues Breakers were able to incorporat
EXTD=e originals such as "Double Crossing Time" and "Key to Love" with
EXTD=revered blues standards, including Freddie King's "Hideaway" and
EXTD=Robert Johnson's "Ramblin' on My Mind" -- which features Clapton
EXTD='s very first lead vocal. Clapton needed precious little time to 
EXTD=gestate the blues. His ability to express himself is uncanny, as 
EXTD=if he were a man twice -- if not three times -- his age. The pass
EXTD=ionate inflections and unforgettable impressions Clapton makes up
EXTD=on these grooves swiftly catapulted him into both international e
EXTD=xposure as well as legendary guitar rock idol status. Blues Break
EXTD=ers With Eric Clapton is an invaluable touchtone into primordial 
EXTD=pre-metal rock and roll.  -- Lindsay Planer\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:
EXTD=The 40th anniversary deluxe edition of John Mayall's classic Bl
EXTD=uesbreakers with Eric Clapton album, issued in the U.K. in 2006, 
EXTD=is a two-CD, 43-song affair, even though the original LP had just
EXTD=12 tracks. While the many extras aren't nearly as essential as t
EXTD=he original LP itself, this reissue neatly packages everything th
EXTD=e Clapton lineup of the Bluesbreakers recorded, while still makin
EXTD=g the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton album the centerpiece. Disc
EXTD=one presents both the mono and stereo mixes of the record, which
EXTD=was not just Mayall's best, but also a cornerstone of both Briti
EXTD=sh blues and blues-rock, as well as being the first to showcase C
EXTD=lapton's talents in full bloom (and in a purer blues context than
EXTD=anytime before or since). In common with many such mono-stereo p
EXTD=ackages for CD reissues, most listeners won't find the difference
EXTD=s drastic, but sometimes they're noticeable -- in mono, Mayall's 
EXTD=vocal on "All Your Love" has a much hollower, echoing feel, and "
EXTD=Parchman Farm" has keyboards that are inaudible in the stereo mix
EXTD=(which, in turn, has a longer harmonica intro for the same song)
EXTD=\n\nOf more value, at least as far as the extras go, is disc two
EXTD=, which presents no less than 19 tracks that the Clapton lineup r
EXTD=ecorded in 1965 and 1966 that didn't appear on the Bluesbreakers 
EXTD=with Eric Clapton album. This includes the 1965 "I'm Your Witch D
EXTD=octor"/"Telephone Blues" single, the A-side of which is not only 
EXTD=one of the Bluesbreakers' greatest recordings, but one of the gre
EXTD=at rock non-hit singles of the '60s by anyone, with searing futur
EXTD=istic distorted guitar. Also on hand is the fine late-1965 soul-p
EXTD=op-flavored studio recording "On Top of the World," and the less 
EXTD=impressive, more traditional blues of the obscure "Bernard Jenkin
EXTD=s"/"Lonely Years" single. Then there are eight previously unrelea
EXTD=sed 1965-1966 BBC recordings, only one of them ("Key to Love") of
EXTD=a song that appeared on the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton reco
EXTD=rd - the other tracks include radio versions of "I'm Your Witchdoc
EXTD=tor," "On Top of the World," the early Mayall single "Crawling Up
EXTD=a Hill"/"Crocodile Walk," and three cool numbers the Bluesbreake
EXTD=rs never put on their '60s studio records ("Cheating Woman," "Bye
EXTD=Bye Bird," and "Nowhere to Turn"). Rounding out the disc are the
EXTD=half-dozen 1966 live recordings (with both Clapton and Jack Bruc
EXTD=e in the band) that have appeared on compilations (five of them o
EXTD=n Primal Solos, and the sixth, "They Call It Stormy Monday," on t
EXTD=he Looking Back collection). The sound on the BBC cuts is decent,
EXTD=though the performances not as full and cutting as the Clapton l
EXTD=ineup's studio work - the live material is in fuzzier sound, thoug
EXTD=h listenable. Despite the uneven nature of the second disc, howev
EXTD=er, it's great to have all of this Mayall-Clapton material in one
EXTD=place, and impossible to imagine a more definitive collection of
EXTD=the Mayall-Clapton Bluesbreakers recordings. [The Deluxe Edition

EXTD=tralia]\n\nWell this is one of the most memorable LPs of my life.
EXTD=I have been a Blues fan (fanatic?) for 40 years and it all start
EXTD=ed with this LP. I probably played along with the first side of t
EXTD=his record everyday of my Junior year in High School. I had been 
EXTD=introduced, as a teen age American, to R&B and Blues with the Rol
EXTD=ling Stones, especially the 12x5 album, when they did Little Walt
EXTD=er's (1950s version ala Jay "Hootie" McShann and Walter Brown's 1
EXTD=941 original) "Confessin' The Blues" (still the greatest Chicago 
EXTD=Blues tune ever recorded by a British band). That was 1965, I got
EXTD=to know all the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley originals. But this r
EXTD=ecord opened up the Chicago Blues-But done differently, not just 
EXTD=mere imitation-(that has been suggested in previous reviews, but 
EXTD=I never believed it-(check out the differences in style and arran
EXTD=gement and sound) they really didn't/couldn't do that and they kn
EXTD=ew it, or at least Clapton did. Mayall was older than the rest an
EXTD=d he really wanted to emulate his idols in Chicago. Clapton had a
EXTD=deeper (and younger) perception on this genre- and was a White B
EXTD=ritish guy! Clapton was a lot like his young protege Doyle Bramha
EXTD=ll II on his latest Sessions for Robert J- an extension on his fi
EXTD=rst ever recorded vocal "Ramblin' On My Mind" on this CD. Bramhal
EXTD=l confessed he never listened to Johnson much before this session
EXTD=Well Clapton had been with the Yardbirds (as we all know) and h
EXTD=ad been getting into Blues with Mayall's extensive record collect
EXTD=ion. He came to this session also with a fresh mind. \n\nThe sess
EXTD=ion was done at a loud- "club-like" sound level which perplexed t
EXTD=he sound engineers. The distortion of the Marshall amp with the L
EXTD=es Paul was augmented by the sound engineers to make something re
EXTD=ally unique. The up front guitar of Clapton was something also ne
EXTD=ver heard before (even with the Butterfield Band). This made it r
EXTD=eally different than Chicago Blues which tended to blend in overd
EXTD=riven tube amps with vocals and amplified harps. What a great and
EXTD=inspirational sound. This was the thing the caused Hendrix to ta
EXTD=ke Blues to a different level and finally a different genre! \n\n
EXTD=Time is the great equalizer of all music, classical, jazz, blues,
EXTD=folk, it doesn't matter. This album still sounds good, but becau
EXTD=se it has been emulated by all blues-rockers for the last 40 year
EXTD=s it can sound stale to the newcomer, oldcomer, or someone who ha
EXTD=s just heard it and notices it sounds "familiar" now. Also the tr
EXTD=acks are not of uniform brilliance, after all it was just a hiped
EXTD=up night club set that they recorded. Clapton says that his reco
EXTD=llection of the session was unpacking, playing, packing up and le
EXTD=aving. This shows to some degree how much we owe to Mike Vernon a
EXTD=nd the production team. \n\nThe highlight of the set is usually a
EXTD=scribed to "Have You Heard", very interestingly redone on the 70t
EXTD=h Birthday Concert DVD. However, the original had added horns and
EXTD=some B.B. King style licks from Clapton-something he got more an
EXTD=d more into to the present day and he did even more of at the Bir
EXTD=thday Concert. The fat and thick sound is the best part of this t
EXTD=une. Also it was an original Mayall penned tune. All of the best 
EXTD=tunes on this LP were originals except for Hideaway. Clapton's re
EXTD=ndition of the Freddie King's masterpiece took this tune to a new
EXTD=level-something similar to Stevie Ray Vaughan's rendition of Lar
EXTD=ry Davis' "Texas Flood". It became an old tune with a new sound a
EXTD=nd style. This is the number, to me, that changed the Blues to Bl
EXTD=ues-Rock! \n\nThe other two classic tunes on this LP are the high
EXTD=ly underrated and double-tracked "Double Crossing Time", supposed
EXTD=ly about Jack Bruce. It is Mayall's greatest minor key blues, bet
EXTD=ter than "The Death of J.B. Lenoir". The feeling in Clapton's gui
EXTD=tar is unsurpassed. The other tune is "Little Girl" with its Jimm
EXTD=y Reed updated rock groove. Clapton does his best solo on this tu
EXTD=ne with precise bends over a difficult beat to keep up with. Walt
EXTD=er Trout also did a good version of this tune with Mayall in the 
EXTD=1980s. \n\nThe rest of the record is classic. The band itself was
EXTD=very good with Hugie Flint on drums and John McVie on the bass. 
EXTD=Mayall made his international reputation with this disc and it ha
EXTD=s lasted to this day, he became the "Godfather of British Blues" 
EXTD=because of this sound-and remember it was replicated (or tried to
EXTD=be replicated on his next 3 or 4 records). However, it does have
EXTD=some filler with tunes such as What I Say (the Brits loved Ray C
EXTD=harles) with a Day Tripper riff in part of it. And I never could 
EXTD=understand why Mayall, who was only ever an average harp player, 
EXTD=would do Little Walter's "It Ain't Right". However, this CD, with
EXTD=bonus cuts is essential for anyone who wants to understand the t
EXTD=ransition of the Blues into the evolution of Rock, Acid Rock, Met
EXTD=al and so on. It is truly a classic recording. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM C

EXTD=Matyas\n\nThis album contains what may be the finest guitar playi
EXTD=ng of Eric Clapton's career. The guy tears into these songs with 
EXTD=a kind of ferocity that makes his recordings with the Yardbirds s
EXTD=eem tame. He churns out some truly bone-shredding melodies with a
EXTD=relentless, fiery passion that simply doesn't let up. It's the k
EXTD=ind of brutal onslaught that recalls the raw, smoldering sounds f
EXTD=ound in old Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, and (dare I say it?) Robert 
EXTD=Johnson songs. This is basically as close as Clapton ever got to 
EXTD=his idols, and that's a mighty fine compliment indeed. And just l
EXTD=isten to that tone! The guitars are soaked with in-the-red levels
EXTD=of distortion- they sound cruel and filthy, dripping with anger 
EXTD=and sexuality. I think it's safe to say that nothing else release
EXTD=d in 1966 sounded quite like this. No wonder this album was so in
EXTD=fluental. The other players on this record ultimatly fall into Cl
EXTD=apton's shadow, but they're still pretty good. Bassist John McVie
EXTD=and drummer Hughie Flint make for a bedrock rhythm section, prop
EXTD=elling the songs and lending them a tough, relentless bite. Flint
EXTD=gets to show off his considerable chops during a cover of "What'
EXTD=d I Say," exectuting a hypnotic, almost jazzy solo with great fin
EXTD=esse. To be honest, I've never been the biggest fan of Mayall him
EXTD=self- as a vocalist, he lacks the raw sexuality and emotional dir
EXTD=ectness essential to blues singing. In fact, he sounds downright 
EXTD=timid on some of these songs. It tends to temper the intensity of
EXTD=the music. However, he makes up for this deficiency by being an 
EXTD=excellent organist (listen to how he makes that Hammond of his wa
EXTD=il!) and a good songwriter (He penned "Have You Heard," "Key To L
EXTD=ove," "Little Girl," and transformed the blues standard "Baby Ple

EXTD=So, that leaves us with a whole pile of great songs: "Hideaway"
EXTD=and "Steppin' Out" are smokin' instrumentals, while "All Your Lo
EXTD=ve" is a nasty boogie with some of Clapton's toughest playing. Th
EXTD=e afformentioned "What'd I Say" positively cooks, and "Parchman F
EXTD=arm" is almost funky with its relentless rhythms. My personal fav
EXTD=orite track here is "Have You Heard," a slow-burning monster of a

EXTD=ronet Blue (California]\n\nThis was the record that introduced ma
EXTD=ny of us to the Les Paul and overdriven Marshall sound. But there's
EXTD=even more here. The solos, notes, phrasing, slight bends are sim
EXTD=ply perfect. This was the sort of playing that earned EC the high

EXTD=\n\nClapton was only about 21 or so when he made this recording. 
EXTD=The youngster got the typical support from Mayall, who, then and 
EXTD=now, had a keen ear for talent on the rise and was willing to giv
EXTD=e that talent space in his band. Slowhand plays well on this raw 
EXTD=and unrefined recording, but the work here is more of a look back
EXTD=to his influences than it is a definition of what Clapton was de
EXTD=stined to become.\n\nI've docked this CD one star for the atrocio
EXTD=us cover of "What'd I Say." Not only doesn't it improve on the Ra
EXTD=y Charles original (it would be nearly impossible to do that anyw
EXTD=ay), but drummer Hughie Flint should have been jailed for his ham
EXTD=handed playing. This is the WORST drum solo ever put down on tap

EXTD=p in April 1966, Decca's sound engineer initially refused to coop

EXTD=propriately enough with a few notes from Clapton's Les, 'All Your
EXTD=Love' kicks off the album in fine style, and gives the impressio
EXTD=n that Eric is just loosening up for 'Hideaway', an instrumental 
EXTD=which showcases his remarkable fluidity, and for my money the pic

EXTD=real weak link in the chain. As his performance on 'What'd I Say'
EXTD=proves, he ain't no Ray Charles\n\n'Beano' is certainly not the

EXTD=pton left the Yardbirds after their big hit "For Your Love" as he
EXTD=felt they were becoming too commercial and straying away from th
EXTD=eir blues roots. Keyboardist John Mayall quickly recruited the gu
EXTD=itar prodigy for his Blues Breakers. The group has gone through m
EXTD=any incarnations, but the lineup that recorded Blues Breakers wit
EXTD=h Eric Clapton is the most famous. The album shows why Mr. Clapto
EXTD=n inspired people to write Clapton is God on walls throughout Lon
EXTD=don. His guitar playing is expressive, inventive and down right i
EXTD=ncredible. He effortlessly moves through guitar passages, making 
EXTD=complication progressions with ease. He makes the guitar sing and
EXTD=is in complete control of the instrument. He even makes his sing
EXTD=ing debut on "Ramblin' On My Mind". John McVie (future member of 
EXTD=Fleetwood Mac) plays a heavy and tight bass and along with drumme
EXTD=r Hughie Flint, they form a strong and powerful rhythm section. T
EXTD=he one problem with the band is John Mayall himself. While he had
EXTD=a great eye for talent, he was not the greatest musician. His pl
EXTD=aying is adequate, but his singing leaves something to be desired
EXTD=That said, this album is a must for any blues fan or if you lik

EXTD=l's) best, January 7, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\nFrom the first over
EXTD=driven powerful vibrato notes of Clapton's Les Paul, you realise 
EXTD=you are in a new world of blues guitar playing. Incredible today 
EXTD=and it must have been overpowering in 1966. Clapton's powerful to
EXTD=ne and style is exceptional. My favourites: 'Hideaway' (makes Fre
EXTD=ddie King's original sound pedestrian), 'Double Crossing Time' (g
EXTD=reat rhythm lines and blistering solo), 'Have you Heard?' (hearts
EXTD=topping solo work), and his tour de force, 'Steppin Out'. The ban
EXTD=d are outstandingly good too and Mayalls' solo 'Parchman Farm' pr
EXTD=ovides a good resting point from guitar overkill. I agree with th
EXTD=e other reviews in that 'What I'd Say' is comparatively weak and 
EXTD=the drum solo excessively long and dull. I always fast forward ov
EXTD=er the solo, but find the rest of the track enjoyable. Hughie Fli
EXTD=nt was a great drummer, just not a great soloist! \nAny lover of 
EXTD=electric guitar music should own this outstanding recording.
