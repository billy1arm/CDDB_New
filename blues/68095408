EXTD=David Bowie - Nile Rodgers\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: After summing up
EXTD=his maverick tendencies on Scary Monsters, David Bowie aimed for
EXTD=the mainstream Let's Dance. Hiring Chic bassist Nile Rodgers as 
EXTD=a co-producer, Bowie created a stylish, synthesized post-disco da
EXTD=nce music that was equally informed by classic soul and the emerg
EXTD=ing New Romantic subgenre of New Wave, which was ironically heavi
EXTD=ly inspired by Bowie himself. Let's Dance comes tearing out of th
EXTD=e date, propulsed by the skittering "Modern Love," the seductivel
EXTD=y menacing "China Girl" and the brittle funk of the title track. 
EXTD=All three songs became international hits, and for good reason --
EXTD=they are catchy, accessible pop songs that have just enough of a
EXTD=n alien edge to make them distinctive. However, that careful bala
EXTD=nce is quickly thrown off by a succession of pleasant but unremar
EXTD=kable plastic soul workouts. "Cat People" and a cover of Metro's 
EXTD="Criminal World" are relatively strong songs, but the remainder o
EXTD=f the album indicates the Bowie was entering a songwriting slump.
EXTD=However, the three hits were enough to make the album a massive 
EXTD=hit, and their power hasn't diminished over the years, even if th
EXTD=e rest of the record sounds like an artifact. -- Stephen Thomas E
EXTD=rlewine\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nDavid Bowie returned to r
EXTD=ecording after a four-year break with this relatively clean-cut 1
EXTD=983 album. Although offering another definite new direction for B
EXTD=owie, with Nile Rodgers of Chic helping to produce a stylish post
EXTD=disco dance sound, Let's Dance is a mixed bag. Much of the album
EXTD='s success was due to its three danceable hit singles--"China Gir
EXTD=l," a sensuous Bowie/Iggy Pop collaboration, the distinctive "Mod
EXTD=ern Love," and the funky title track. However, much of the rest o
EXTD=f the album is bland and vapid, marking the start of serious decl
EXTD=ine in Bowie's songwriting skills. A cover of Metro's "Criminal W
EXTD=orld" and "Cat People" are the only other strong tracks here. --J

EXTD=omes out of his shell and decides it's time to dance again, albei
EXTD=t (of course) with a slightly artistic stance. With this record, 
EXTD=a whole new post-punk generation discovers the human chameleon, o
EXTD=n what is his most extroverted and accessible record since the gl
EXTD=am days. The title track was a major hit single, and both "China 
EXTD=Girl" (he hadn't forgotten Iggy) and "Modern Love" got lots of ai
EXTD=rplay. Overall, it was as shiny as a new penny and as friendly as
EXTD=a puppy thanks to help from former Chic-sters and Stevie Ray Vau

EXTD=tzerland. \n\nDigitally remastered by Peter Mew and Nigel Reeve (
EXTD=1999, Abbey Road Studios, London, England). \n\nThough he continu
EXTD=ed to evolve throughout his career, Bowie's post-SCARY MONSTERS o
EXTD=utput was markedly less stellar than his acclaimed '70s work. LET
EXTD='S DANCE, however, is arguably his most memorable '80s recording.
EXTD=It didn't hurt that he reached out to some talented friends, lik
EXTD=e Stevie Ray Vaughan (who makes his recorded debut here as lead g
EXTD=uitarist) and co-writers Iggy Pop ("China Girl") and Peter Godwin
EXTD=(of "Images of Heaven" fame, who helps out on "Criminal World.")
EXTD=Ultimately, though, it's Bowie's unique vision that makes LET'S 
EXTD=DANCE a success. His funky, synth-driven avant-pop romps are shot
EXTD=through with a romance and poignancy that sets them apart from m
EXTD=uch of his later work. "Modern Love," for example, manages to be 
EXTD=irresistibly catchy and ostensibly upbeat while depicting alienat
EXTD=ion and unfulfilled desires. YEAR: 1983
