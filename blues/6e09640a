EXTD=379 from New York\n\nTo be honest with you I really don't like Girls Girls Girls all that much. The songs for the most part are really weak. There are a few great songs mixed in with some pretty bad material. The album starts off on a high note with 
EXTD=one of the best Crue songs ever, Wild Side. It then goes into the title track which is also a great song. The next song is Dancing On Glass. It's not a bad song but It's really not that good either. It then takes a complete nose dive with Bad Boy Boo
EXTD=gie and Nona. I don't even know if Nona could be considered a song. It's like a minute and a half of cheesy music and the band chanting Nona with Vince singing 1 line. Five Years Dead is next on the album, that song is really not that good either but
EXTD=It's a whole lot better than the previous 2. After Five Years Dead the album gets good with 4 solid songs. All In the Name Of... is a great song, probably the best on the album. Sumpthin for Nuthin' is an excellent song as well as the ballad You're 
EXTD=All I Need. They also do an excellent live cover of Elvis' Jailhouse Rock. So the original album ends on a good note.\n\nThe Crucial Crue version of the album has instrumental versions of Girls Girls Girls and Wild Side. The songs I could do without 
EXTD=but it's cool in the beginning of Girls... there is an intro from the band and the producer Tom Werman. From what it sounds like they were sending these songs to the record label so they could hear the progress that they're making on the album. Then 
EXTD=there is the song Rodeo. That song is amazing. I don't understand why they left it off the album in the first place. It's a lot better than Bad Boy Boogie, Dancing On Glass, and Five Years Dead. Then they have another version of Nona which is instrum
EXTD=ental and actually better than the one they put on the album. It has a whole heavy type part in the middle of it. Before going back into the original boring music. Don't get me wrong Girls Girls Girls is a great album to add to your collection if you
EXTD=are a Motley Crue fan but if you are a casual or first time listener get Too Fast for Love, Shout at the Devil, New Tattoo, or Greatest Hits. If you really want to get into Motley Crue I also suggest buying Generation Swine.
