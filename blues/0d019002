EXTD=series of box sets containing CD replicas of the Rolling Stones'
EXTD=singles and EPs, Singles 1965-1967 covers the classic period bet
EXTD=ween "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "In Another Land," the t
EXTD=ime when the Stones started to reach beyond their hard blues base
EXTD=, and created some of their most indelible music. Like the previo
EXTD=us box, Singles 1963-1965, each of the group's British and Americ
EXTD=an singles and EPs are represented, reproduced in paper sleeves a
EXTD=nd pressed on all-black CDs designed to look like a 45. Where tha
EXTD=t set had some rarities -- including the first release of such cl
EXTD=assic EPs as The Rolling Stones, 5 X 5, and Got Live If You Want 
EXTD=It! -- every cut on this box has been on CD before (all showed up
EXTD=on the triple-disc The Singles Collection: The London Years) and
EXTD=there is a slight tweaking of history here, with certain singles
EXTD=(like "Satisfaction," "Get Off of My Cloud," and "Paint It, Blac
EXTD=k") containing both the American and British B-sides. This may up
EXTD=set some purists, but it's a clever, efficient way to cover this 
EXTD=ground - plus, even with the added song these discs run well under
EXTD=ten minutes, so it's a nice bonus that beefs up the discs slight
EXTD=ly and makes them more listenable. Of course, this isn't designed
EXTD=for listenability in the first place, since changing the 11 disc
EXTD=s is cumbersome, even with a multi-disc player -- it's really a s
EXTD=et to look at and admire, to gaze at each of the picture sleeves.
EXTD=But, if they're listened to a disc at a time, it does reveal wha
EXTD=t a splendid singles band the Rolling Stones were. There has neve
EXTD=r been a single as snide and cynical as "Satisfaction" backed by 
EXTD="The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man," while there has n
EXTD=ever been one as nasty and antisocial as "Paint It, Black" b/w "S
EXTD=tupid Girl," and their rebel reputation was cemented by "Get Off 
EXTD=of My Cloud" b/w "I'm Free." These are revelations that this set 
EXTD=makes clear through its singles replicas, and it helps make this 
EXTD=set a necessary purchase for the hardcore.  -- Stephen Thomas Erl

EXTD=e London Years" Compared To The 3 "Singles" Box Sets, June 12, 20
EXTD=06 \nBy  Mark Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nThe purpose of this 
EXTD=review is to completely compare the contents of "Singles Collecti
EXTD=on: The London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets which as a grou
EXTD=p contain the same songs plus more. There are some good compariso
EXTD=ns in the other reviews, but also several omissions and inaccurac
EXTD=ies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear things up a b
EXTD=it as to what songs are included on each, and which "missing" son
EXTD=gs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, particularly "More 
EXTD=Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these collections i
EXTD=s rather expensive, so hopefully this may help you decide which s
EXTD=ets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thing first though
EXTD=, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP contained in the 
EXTD="Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the full length C
EXTD=D "Got Live If You Want It". They share the same title but that's
EXTD=all, and were actually two different releases. Buying the full l
EXTD=ength CD will NOT get you all the same songs on the EP as indicat
EXTD=ed in another review. With that out of the way..... \n\n"Singles 
EXTD=1963-1965": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all o
EXTD=f the songs included in this box set, with the exception of 3 ori
EXTD=ginal British EP's exclusive to the box set. The first EP contain
EXTD=s You Better Move On (also available on "December's Children") an
EXTD=d Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 also available on "Mo
EXTD=re Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The second EP (original
EXTD=ly titled "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 Sou
EXTD=th Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around and Around, all
EXTD=of which are also available on the "12 X 5" CD. The third EP (th
EXTD=e afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contains early live 
EXTD=versions of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Somebody To Love,
EXTD=Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alright, none of 
EXTD=which are available on any other CD (with the possible exception 
EXTD=of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same version included 
EXTD=on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusion: Both "The L
EXTD=ondon Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early single/B-sides
EXTD=Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as well as I Want T
EXTD=o Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren't available o
EXTD=n any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs not included e
EXTD=lsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP. So the deciding 
EXTD=factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" would appea
EXTD=r to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "Singles Collection
EXTD=: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this 2n
EXTD=d box set, with no exceptions. Both contain the single/B-sides Lo
EXTD=ng Long While and We Love You (also available on "More Hot Rocks") 
EXTD=and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which aren't available on
EXTD=any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs not included el
EXTD=sewhere. No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1968-1971": "Single
EXTD=s Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs include
EXTD=d in this 3rd box set, with a few unique exceptions. The third bo
EXTD=x set additionally contains Everybody Needs Somebody to Love (als
EXTD=o available on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and three non-ABKCO B-s
EXTD=ides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-sides are the Ry
EXTD=Cooder instrumental Natural Magic (from the film "Performance" s
EXTD=oundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bitch and Sway whi
EXTD=ch were the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. My guess is the
EXTD=licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin Records, etc.
EXTD=and hadn't yet been negotiated when "The London Years" was origi
EXTD=nally released back in 1989. The remixes appear to be 3 different
EXTD="rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The box set also 
EXTD=contains a bonus DVD (see the item description for more on that).
EXTD=\n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" cont
EXTD=ain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on "More Hot Roc
EXTD=ks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available on "Hot Rocks 
EXTD=1"). So the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singl
EXTD=es 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-sides, the thr
EXTD=ee remixes and the DVD contained in the box set. \n\nFinal Conclu
EXTD=sion: For the completest collector who has to have absolutely eve
EXTD=rything on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Buy all 3 box sets, 
EXTD=or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and the two box set
EXTD=s "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of duplication, though
EXTD="The London Years" runs a little cheaper than the box sets and you
EXTD=don't have to change CD's as often). \n\nA slightly cheaper opti
EXTD=on if you're mainly interested in completing the ABKCO Rolling St
EXTD=ones "canon" not released on the regular studio full-length CD's 
EXTD=is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and "Singles 196
EXTD=3-1965". You'd only be missing the three non-ABKCO B-sides and th
EXTD=e 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper option still, i
EXTD=f you're only interested in the very early singles and live EP and 
EXTD=can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to buy "More Hot R
EXTD=ocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1965". With tho
EXTD=se 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Your Plane? and
EXTD=the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\nIn truth, the
EXTD=2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London Years" make a
EXTD=n interesting listen because each is primarily made up of A and B s
EXTD=ides not included on the regular studio CD's. So they're almost l
EXTD=ike listening to independent CD's without repeating too many song
EXTD=s you'll hear when listening to the other albums. The 2nd disc fr
EXTD=om "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits V
EXTD=ol. 2)" do the same, only with different selections of songs, so 
EXTD=comparing these two further is highly recommended as well. \n\nDe
EXTD=cisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\nThe Stones As The World First Heard Them!, November 16, 200
EXTD=4 \nBy  Robert L. Smith (San Francisco, CA United States]\n\nIn B
EXTD=ritain in the 1960s, albums did not occupy the preeminent positio
EXTD=n in the distribution of popular music that CDs do today. Most re
EXTD=cord buyers bought singles (two songs) or EPs ("Extended Plays," 
EXTD=4-5 songs), which were cheaper, and in any case, usually filled i
EXTD=n the gap between albums, and featured songs which would not reap
EXTD=pear on the LP. Thus, the most famous of the Rolling Stones' earl
EXTD=y work was originally heard on this format. This excellent reissu
EXTD=e presents the singles as they were first issued, including cardb
EXTD=oard reproductions of the original picture sleeves. The opaque bl
EXTD=ack CDs--a new experience for me--really do resemble old vinyl re
EXTD=cords, and the sound quality is absolutely phenomenal! This secon
EXTD=d set of singles documents a particularly creative period for the
EXTD=band, and is frankly better than its predecessor because (by and
EXTD=large) the material rises to another level. Both sets are excell
EXTD=ent, however, and truly necessary for hardcore Stones fans. It ta
EXTD=kes awhile to listen to twenty-some CDs that contain only a few s
EXTD=ongs each, but it's worth the effort to experience these classic 
EXTD=tracks as the world first heard them. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER R

EXTD=that they can never get it straight. To this day they have still
EXTD=failed to issue the TRUE STEREO versions of hits like SATISFACTI
EXTD=ON and GET OFF MY CLOUD. They claim thay they have,but it's a far
EXTD=se. The only place you can get the TRUE STEREO versions is on imp
EXTD=ort albums and cd's released overseas in the 70's and 80's. In ad
EXTD=dition, this box set should be entirely in MONO. All singles duri
EXTD=ng the 60's were released in MONO or SIMULATE STEREO which is als

EXTD=I'm one of those people who believe that The Rolling Stones ceas
EXTD=ed to be relevant after Brian Jones died. So there's that. Also, 
EXTD=I bought many of these singles back in the day in the original pi

EXTD=their artistic peak years. The songs included in this set are al
EXTD=most all classics. The packaging is fabulously fun. I love the id
