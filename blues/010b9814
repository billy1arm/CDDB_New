EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Way back in 1985, before the CD revolution t
EXTD=ruly kicked in, Atlantic released the monumental archival project
EXTD=Atlantic Rhythm and Blues: 1947-1974, a seven-volume set of double
EXTD=albums chronicling the label's crucial role in the development o
EXTD=f R&B and soul. Over the course of that set (later condensed to e
EXTD=ight CDs) it was possible to hear the music develop from blues in
EXTD=to a soul -- an impressive feat as a sheer compilation, one that 
EXTD=is even more stunning when it's considered that it all came from 
EXTD=one label and its subsidiaries. Atlantic Rhythm and Blues did the j
EXTD=ob so well that the 2007s set Atlantic Soul: 1959-1975 can't help
EXTD=but pale a little in comparison, as it lacks both the scope and 
EXTD=historical heft of its predecessor. Then again, Atlantic Soul doe
EXTD=sn't try to supplant Atlantic Rhythm and Blues -- as produced and c
EXTD=ompiled by Billy Vera, it's intended as a supplement, a way to ex
EXTD=pand upon the story, fill in a few holes, explore hidden byways l
EXTD=eft behind by the first set. It's for collectors and fanatics, wh
EXTD=ich should be evident by the very fact that it's released as a li
EXTD=mited edition on Rhino Handmade, not a full-fledged release from 
EXTD=the boutique imprint's parent label. That very audience should fi
EXTD=nd Atlantic Soul enormously satisfying, although they may still h
EXTD=ave a few quibbles with some of the details. Some might find the 
EXTD=opening triptych from Ray Charles, LaVern Baker and Jimmy Ricks, an
EXTD=d Ben E. King to be a shade too heavy on strings, jazz and big ba
EXTD=nds -- music that sets the stage for '60s soul, yet not quite bel
EXTD=onging to it -- some might find this too heavy on covers (albeit 
EXTD=good, interesting ones) of pop hits by soul bands, but most will 
EXTD=likely wonder why such staples as Otis' "Hard to Handle" and Aret
EXTD=ha's "I Say a Little Prayer," King Floyd's "Groove Me," and the P
EXTD=ersuaders' "Thin Line Between Love and Hate" are here, as they do
EXTD=n't quite fit among the obscure gems that comprise the heart of t
EXTD=his set. Such complaints are valid but they're hard to level agai
EXTD=nst a set that offers so much wonderful music, so much of it unfa
EXTD=miliar even to dedicated soul fans. Of course, there are familiar
EXTD=names here -- the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, Wilson Pickett, Cla

EXTD=as the generosity to rightly bring in Hall and Oates' "She's Gone" 
EXTD=as one of the great soul singles of the '70s. It all adds up to a
EXTD=thoroughly entertaining, enlightening set that may not be as ess
EXTD=ential to a wide audience as Atlantic Rhythm and Blues, but for any
EXTD=body who's mesmorized that set, this is a welcome belated sequel.
