EXTD=MG EXPERT REVIEW: The most distinctive thing about Double Fantasy
EXTD=, the last album John Lennon released during his lifetime, is the
EXTD=very thing that keeps it from being a graceful return to form fr
EXTD=om the singer/songwriter, returning to active duty after five yea
EXTD=rs of self-imposed exile. As legend has it, Lennon spent those ye
EXTD=ars in domestic bliss, being a husband, raising a baby, and, of c
EXTD=ourse, baking bread. Double Fantasy was designed as a window into
EXTD=that bliss and, to that extent, he decided to make it a joint al
EXTD=bum with Yoko Ono, to illustrate how complete there union was. Fo
EXTD=r her part, Ono decided to take a stab at pop and while these are
EXTD=relatively tuneful for her, they nevertheless disrupt the feel a
EXTD=nd flow of Lennon's material, which has a consistent tone and the
EXTD=me. He's surprisingly sentimental, not just when he's expressing 
EXTD=love for his wife ("Dear Yoko," "Woman") and child ("Beautiful Bo
EXTD=y (Darling Boy)"), but when he's coming to terms with his quiet y
EXTD=ears ("Watching the Years," "Cleanup Time") and his return to cre
EXTD=ative life. These are really nice tunes, and what's special about
EXTD=them is their niceness -- it's a sweet acceptance of middle age,
EXTD=which, of course, makes his assassination all the sadder. For th
EXTD=at alone, Double Fantasy is noteworthy, yet it's hard not to thin
EXTD=k that it's a bit of a missed opportunity -- primarily because it
EXTD=s themes would be stronger without the Ono songs, but also becaus
EXTD=e the production is just a little bit too slick and constrained, 
EXTD=sounding very much of its time. Ultimately, these complaints fall
EXTD=by the wayside because Lennon's best songs here cement the last 
EXTD=part of his legend, capturing him at peace and in love. According
EXTD=to some reports, that perception was a bit of a fantasy, but som
EXTD=etimes the fantasy means more than the reality, and that's certai
EXTD=nly the case here. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAmazon.com Edito
EXTD=rial Review\nStrange as it seems now, the last album John Lennon 
EXTD=released in his lifetime was intended as a comeback, or rather as
EXTD=a parting wave at retirement: "Watching the Wheels" and "Beautif
EXTD=ul Boy" celebrate the joys he found outside the star system, and 
EXTD="(Just Like) Starting Over" is a slightly awkward rocker about re
EXTD=joining the domestic world that's also sort of about rejoining th
EXTD=e pop world. The studio-pro arrangements are a little too slick, 
EXTD=but Lennon rarely sounded happier. Ono, whose songs alternate wit
EXTD=h his in a series of thematic diptychs, was taking a stab at chan
EXTD=neling her artier impulses into pop and is generally less success
EXTD=ful--her voice works in a context of art-weirdness, but not as we
EXTD=ll in conventional tunes. This 2000 remastered reissue is fleshed
EXTD=out with a demo of "Help Me to Help Myself" and Ono's solo versi
EXTD=on of "Walking on Thin Ice," which was recorded on the same day h
EXTD=er husband was shot to death. --Douglas Wolk \n\nAmazon.com Custo
EXTD=mer Review\nAmong his best (and hers), June 30, 2001 \nReviewer: 
EXTD=Blake Watson from Winnetka, CA USA\n\nI would rate this as Lennon
EXTD='s best, second only to "Plastic Ono Band" which might seem ironi
EXTD=c, given that the latter is a raw, minimalist recording of one ma
EXTD=n's anger at, well, everything, and there's very little vitriol i
EXTD=n this album at all.\n\nBut these albums have two things in commo
EXTD=n: intimacy and conviction. After "Plastic Ono Band", Lennon's al
EXTD=bums began to sound less sure, less like a man writing and perfor
EXTD=ming from the heart than a man searching desperately for a hit, a
EXTD=musical "ground" to stand on, a social issue, or =something=Th
EXTD=ese albums all had their strong points--the lyricism found on "Wa
EXTD=lls and Bridges", the social conscience of "New York City", the e
EXTD=xplorations of harmony on "Mind Games", etc.--but the artist (and
EXTD=therefore the listener) feels somewhat detached from the materia
EXTD=l. (This may, in part, be due to Phil Spector's production on the
EXTD=se albums, which tended to take the intimacy out of music.]\n\nBy
EXTD=this album, John had found something: his family. This displease
EXTD=d some of his fans from the revolutionary days of "New York City"
EXTD=but even if one finds the music and the thematic material conser
EXTD=vative, there's considerable joy to be had in the performances, w
EXTD=hich never waver for a second.\n\nThe alternation between Lennon'
EXTD=s material and Ono's works for me but I find most people (America
EXTD=ns anyway) can't get around Ono's voice. This is probably her mos
EXTD=t pop-accessible work and I think, like it or not, it was a criti
EXTD=cal part of what fueled Lennon's great work here.\n\nThe extra tr
EXTD=acks are fine, though they were tacked on to sell this CD, and so
EXTD=und it, not particularly fitting in to the rest of the album--whi
EXTD=ch, it should also be noted, is Lennon's most cohesive work.\n\nA
EXTD=mazon.com Customer Review\nI'm Paying The Price For Throwing The 
EXTD=Dice, June 13, 2001 \nReviewer: David Bradley from Sterling, VA U
EXTD=nited States\n\nThe thrill of DOUBLE FANTASY is the exchange betw
EXTD=een Lennon and Ono and, despite the comments of some rather short
EXTD=sighted critics, Ono's work on this CD is on at least an equal f
EXTD=ooting with Lennon's.\n\nOno's work here is, in fact, much more i
EXTD=nventive than Lennon's, and that just plays into the DOUBLE FANTA
EXTD=SY concept. The point of Lennon's later work, his Yoko-related ar
EXTD=t, was not that they were identical twins or that he was the domi
EXTD=nant partner in their relationship. The point was that they were 
EXTD=two pieces of the same whole, ying and yang--Yoko was, as he says
EXTD=on "Woman," "the other half of the sky."\n\nLennon's work here i
EXTD=s fine, but it's hardly pushing any envelopes. It is traditional 
EXTD=Pop--"Starting Over" uses the oldest chord progression in the boo
EXTD=k--and has more to do with telling a story than musical inovation
EXTD=It's good stuff, and Lennon's voice is particularly good here, 
EXTD=but an entire album of this would have come dangerously close to 
EXTD=the mundane standard set by his post-IMAGINE LPs.\n\nSo, listen w
EXTD=ith open ears to Yoko on "Kiss Kiss Kiss," "Yes I'm Your Angel," 
EXTD="Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him," and the magnificent "Walki
EXTD=ng On Thin Ice," now included on this extended CD, and you'll hea
EXTD=r an artist who finally learned how to make great Pop songs on DO
EXTD=UBLE FANTASY.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nThis could have been
EXTD=a classic, May 16, 2001 \nReviewer: Jesse R \n\nI would have giv
EXTD=en this 5 stars by just taking into account Lennon's work, but re
EXTD=viewing this CD as it is with Yoko's songs, brings the rating dow
EXTD=n. Yoko truly annoys on this CD, Kiss Kiss Kiss, shows potential 
EXTD=but is let down by the noises at the end of this song which are t
EXTD=ruly laughable.(Warning: when playing Kiss Kiss Kiss - if at all-
EXTD=turn the volume down on this song towards the end!) The only red
EXTD=eeming song by Yoko is 'Every man has a woman', (probably cause L
EXTD=ennon can be heard singing on this one) but even then the version
EXTD=Lennon does of this song with his vocals, shows that when sung b
EXTD=y the right person, Yoko's songs can be halfway decent. I have th
EXTD=e Double Fantasy without the bonus tracks, and having listened to
EXTD=all of Lennon's songs over the years, it's the ones on Double Fa
EXTD=ntasy that I keep coming back to. All of Lennon's songs on 'Doubl
EXTD=e Fantasy' are great, particularly 'Just like (starting over)', '
EXTD=Woman' and 'Watching the Wheels'. These songs aren't just great,(
EXTD=that word doesn't do them justice) they are timeless, classic son
EXTD=gs! Lennon has never sounded happier, it saddens me greatly what 
EXTD=happened after this CD.\n\nI have the entire Lennon collection, w
EXTD=here thankfully the Yoko songs are left off, perhaps this is the 
EXTD=best way to go, it saves you the trouble of having to press skip 
EXTD=on every second track, which you will most likely do upon buying 
EXTD=Double Fantasy. Whilst I appreciate the large role that Yoko play
EXTD=ed in Lennon being content and happy and such emotions coming thr
EXTD=ough in his music, it doesn't deter me from saying that Yoko's so
EXTD=ngs have little place on Double Fantasy, when Lennon's finest mom
EXTD=ents are here. \n\nMy gripe with this CD - the back and forth bet
EXTD=ween Lennon and Yoko on this CD does not really work, this could 
EXTD=have been packaged better, with Lennon's songs filling 1-8 and th
EXTD=en Yoko's songs.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nA heart play, Mar
EXTD=ch 3, 2001 \nReviewer: Cristian Domarchi from Concepcion, Chile\n
EXTD=\nThe re-releasing of this album brings back an interesting point
EXTD=of discussion: how much was Yoko Ono involved in the musical wor
EXTD=k of John Lennon. The fact that John Lennon decided to share his 
EXTD="come-back" album (after five years of self-imposed seclusion to 
EXTD=spend time with his son) with his wife, a different kind of artis
EXTD=t herself, said enough about this point. \n\nSo it's hard to revi
EXTD=ew an album like this. I think the right choice is to hear the al
EXTD=bum as an entity, and to try to appreciate what John and Yoko wer
EXTD=e trying to tell at the beginning of a new decade which brought a
EXTD=lot of expectatives and plans into their lives along with the ha
EXTD=ppiness that the coming of Sean brought them.\n\nFrom this point 
EXTD=of view, one can say that John was happy. You can see it in some 
EXTD=songs where he talks in a very relaxed mood about his life, his r
EXTD=elationship with his son, his wife, and with the whole world. Joh
EXTD=n's songs are gifted by an enormous quality, and, although he may
EXTD=have lost some of the pain, anger and raw feelings that made him
EXTD=record the masterpiece album "Plastic Ono Band" in 1970, his way
EXTD=of living now was also inspiring. Looking it at that way, John s
EXTD=till rocks with tracks like "I'm Losing You" (highly improved, th
EXTD=ough, in the "Anthology" version) and the underrated masterpiece 
EXTD="Cleanup Time". He travels through the varied fields of pop (like
EXTD=in "Starting Over"), love ballads (the classic "Woman" is a time
EXTD=less anthem about how much a man can owe to his other half), and 
EXTD=oriental-arranged pop tunes ("Beautiful Boy" is a lovely ode to S
EXTD=ean, while "Dear Yoko" is a cheering track dedicated to the one w
EXTD=ho inspired most of John's solo work). In my opinion, the best tr
EXTD=ack in the album is "Watching The Wheels", which demonstrates the
EXTD=position John had in the world in this new decade, and how much 
EXTD=he wanted to live a life, and have some time just to sit there an
EXTD=d watch how the world turned, with the peace of mind he couldn't 
EXTD=find in the 60's. The bouns track "Help Me To Help Myself", a pia
EXTD=no demo, is also lovely, and would have made a tremendous finishe
EXTD=d track, if John could have had the time to finish it...\n\nYoko 
EXTD=tried to adequate her work to the pop standards, and while the re
EXTD=sults are not always pleasant (hence "Kiss Kiss Kiss", a horrid t
EXTD=une), she seems to fit in pretty well in another tracks: "Give Me
EXTD=Something" is a perfect follow-up to "I'm Losing You", and this 
EXTD=song, joined by "I'm Moving On" (easily the best Yoko contributio
EXTD=n to this CD) formed a kind of "suite" that is perfectly listenab
EXTD=le. "Yes, I'm Your Angel" and "Beautiful Boys" are attempts to wr
EXTD=ite pop songs, dedicated to her husband and son. Not particularly
EXTD=good. "Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him" has the advantage of
EXTD=having John in background vocals, but also has a great rhythm an
EXTD=d it's a nice "dancing" tune (reminding of the bonus track, "Walk
EXTD=ing On Thin Ice", that song John was working on the day he died).
EXTD=John also does harmony on the heartbreaking "Hard Times Are Over
EXTD=" (another high by Yoko), which sounds even more tearful now we k
EXTD=now that John passed away within days of the releasing of this al
EXTD=bum. So hard times were not over, they were just beginning. These
EXTD=bunch of songs make you think that Yoko WAS an artist, but she s
EXTD=hould have released her stuff apart from John's...\n\nThe sound o
EXTD=f the remastered CD and the bonus tracks help the album to be bet
EXTD=ter, although "Central Park Stroll" is too short. The sound has i
EXTD=mprovements, but the quality of the music is what has made this a
EXTD=lbum a classic.\n\nBy hearing John and Yoko's tracks on this CD y
EXTD=ou should be able to appreciate the feelings of both, and the exp
EXTD=erience of living years that seemed to have a brightful future, b
EXTD=ut were suddenly cut by John's death. This was a happy album, but
EXTD=now it's been associated with the pain that John's death brought
EXTD=to the world. Try not to fall into that. Follow the original spi
EXTD=rit of this CD and enjoy the simple things on life. No matter how
EXTD=your life is, there will be some time when hard times are going 
EXTD=to be over.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nClassic album gets roy
EXTD=al treatment, November 15, 2000 \nReviewer: wtdk from SUISUN, CA 
EXTD=USA\n\nAlthough DF isn't Lennon's (or Ono's) best work, the stron
EXTD=gest material holds up extremely well when compared to Plastic On
EXTD=o Band and Imagine. The arrangements and ensemble playing by the 
EXTD=studio musicians on this album are fine. I personally would loved
EXTD=to have seen Cheap Trick record the whole album with Ono and Len
EXTD=non. The one song they have on the Lennon Anthology (I'm Losing Y
EXTD=ou) has much more punch and power than the final version.\n\nHow 
EXTD=is this version when compared to previous versions of the album? 
EXTD=George Marino's remastering is an improvement on the first CD ver
EXTD=sion of the album. I'm not surprised given the tragic circumstanc
EXTD=es directly after this album was released that Yoko chose not to 
EXTD=remix this album as well. The Mobile Fidelity Sound version of th
EXTD=is fine album still sounds the best. What is a bit mystifying is 
EXTD=why Capitol and Ono didn't issue this and the other reissues usin
EXTD=g HDCD, 24 bit (for an example of the improved sound with 24 bit 
EXTD=listen to The Very Best of Badfinger) or the 20bit K2 method. Any
EXTD=one of these techniques would have enhanced an already terrific a
EXTD=lbum. \n\nFor those who doubted that John had the melodic ability
EXTD=of McCartney, this album (along with Imagine and moments on Mind
EXTD=Games and Walls and Bridges) demonstrates Lennon every bit the equ
EXTD=al of McCartney as a composer of memorable melodies.\n\nHelp Me T
EXTD=o Help Myself shows considerable improvement when compared to the
EXTD=bootleg that has been floating around for the better part of a d
EXTD=ecade. Although clearly a rough draft of the song, Lennon's lyric
EXTD=and soulful vocal raise this fine track from a curiosity to a ra
EXTD=re gem. Yoko's Waling On Thin Ice works very well within the cont
EXTD=ext of the album (although I would have reversed the sequencing a
EXTD=nd had HMTHM last as it is the perfect coda). \n\nThe booklet (li
EXTD=ke the booklets for both Imagine and POB) shows great care and cr
EXTD=eativity was put into this project. The pictures and lyrics are g
EXTD=reat to have available. A pity that there isn't a historical comm
EXTD=entary (like Anthony DeCurtis' in the Anthology set)on the making
EXTD=of the album. \n\nKudos to Capitol and Yoko for doing a terrific

EXTD=al comeback when he was assassinated in 1980. Earlier that year, 
EXTD=the release of DOUBLE FANTASY (after a long layoff from recording
EXTD=, mostly spent raising his young son Sean) let Lennon fans know t
EXTD=hat he and Yoko were still capable of flaunting their creativity 
EXTD=on record. Lennon had matured as a person as well as an artist ov
EXTD=er the preceding several years, after years of personal trials, a
EXTD=nd his personal renaissance was evident on DOUBLE FANTASY, with i
EXTD=t's cheery, accessible pop tunes celebrating the simple joys of f
EXTD=amily life. \n\nThis not being a McCartney album, things never ge
EXTD=t overly sentimental, even on Lennon's odes to Sean (the shimmeri
EXTD=ng ballad "Beautiful Boy") and Yoko (the '50s-influenced "[Just L
EXTD=ike] Starting Over.") Lennon was too complex an artist to release
EXTD=a mindless happy-face album, and even his sunniest observations 
EXTD=are deepened by the complexities of his compositional genius. For
EXTD=her part, Yoko contributes some of the finest songs of her caree
EXTD=r, like the simple but movingly poetic "Every Man Has a Woman Who
EXTD=Loves Him." Lennon's older, wiser worldview is best summed up by
EXTD=the philosophical (and engagingly bouncy) "Watching the Wheels."
