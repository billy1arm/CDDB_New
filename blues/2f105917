EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nIn addition to their indispensable compilations devote
EXTT0=d to the bluesmen and women of the 1920s and 1930s, Yazoo has delivere
EXTT0=d a number of excellent, topical country blues sets as well. Though no
EXTT0=t always as essential as the single-artist discs, they are nonetheles
EXTT0=s valuable on both musical and historical terms. Released simultaneous
EXTT0=ly with the label's bawdy Barrelhouse Mamas collection, Down in Blac
EXTT0=k Bottom is a similar collection of early piano blues, with the focu
EXTT0=s once again being on small combos. Possibly due to the fact that pian
EXTT0=ists were so often thrust into the role of accompanist, few of these a
EXTT0=rtists made significant names for themselves on record. There is a han
EXTT0=dful of exceptions, of course. Little Brother Montgomery was an except
EXTT0=ionally gifted pianist who, before moving to Chicago during the 1940s
EXTT0=, absorbed the rich and varied piano traditions that surrounded him i
EXTT0=n the Jackson, MS, area. Tampa Red remained a popular performer long a
EXTT0=fter his move to the Windy City, where the hokum material he favored w
EXTT0=ent over well with Chicago audiences. Names like Sammy Brown, Sylveste
EXTT0=r Palmer, and Parish Turner, however, remain more mysterious. Most o
EXTT0=f the musicians on this compilation who managed to achieve notoriety d
EXTT0=id so through their piano skills rather than their singing. This was g
EXTT0=ood time music for the most part and, as a result, these signers weren
EXTT0='t the most exceptional of blues versifiers either. Oftentimes the lyr
EXTT0=ics rely on the sort of stock phrases that nearly every bluesman acqui
EXTT0=red as a matter of course. Though the blues on this disc hardly repres
EXTT0=ent the most emotionally compelling of Yazoo's extensive catalog, th
EXTT0=e set will certainly appeal to enthusiasts of the style, as well as bl
EXTT0=ues fans in search of a less demanding introduction to the early recor
EXTT0=dings.  Nathan Bush
