EXTD=EXPERT REVIEW: (This Compilation)  Politely!/Swingin' Pretty gath
EXTD=ers two of Keely Smith's highest-charting vocal pop albums on one
EXTD=CD. Billy May's arrangements on Politely! and Nelson Riddle's wo
EXTD=rk on Swingin' Pretty complement Smith's sweetly impassioned read
EXTD=ings of "On the Sunny Side of the Street," "East of the Sun and W
EXTD=est of the Moon," "Stormy Weather," "Someone to Watch Over Me," a
EXTD=nd other romantic standards. Smooth yet swinging, Politely!/Swing
EXTD=in' Pretty captures Smith at the peak of her powers.  -- Heather 
EXTD=Phares\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: ("Politely")  Joining the Louis Pr
EXTD=ima band at the age of 16, Keely Smith's main role was to be the 
EXTD=foil for Prima's often loony antics on recordings and at live per
EXTD=formances, like on their big hit "That Old Black Magic." The resu
EXTD=lt was that she was given little opportunity to sing ballads. Tha
EXTD=t ended when she and Prima signed on with Capitol Records, which 
EXTD=had more top flight pop vocalists of the day than any other compa
EXTD=ny. This LP is the second of the albums Capitol released under he
EXTD=r name featuring arrangements and a band headed by Billy May. The
EXTD=program balances up-tempo numbers and ballads with matching May 
EXTD=orchestrations. The slower numbers are enhanced by strings, while
EXTD=the faster numbers feature Mays's trademark fluttering flutes ju
EXTD=xtaposed with blaring brass. Smith had an easy to listen to vocal
EXTD=style. One of its major qualities was the earnestness with which
EXTD=she delivered each song, regardless of tempo. This left the impr
EXTD=ession that she sincerely believed in each word of the lyrics. Li
EXTD=ke other vocalists of the 1960 "the song was the thing," and its 
EXTD=use in promoting the singer took a back seat. This especially com
EXTD=es through on "East of the Sun (And West of the Moon)" and an elo
EXTD=quent "I'll Get By."  -- Dave Nathan\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: ("Swin
