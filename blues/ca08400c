EXTD=e Blues" is a stunning album, Julie's fourth and her step out of 
EXTD=being an intimate novelty, a whisperer, into being a full-bodied 
EXTD=singer and a jazz singer at that. The songs are terrific, Russ Ga
EXTD=rcia's arrangements intriguing and Julie is seductive, persuasive
EXTD=and hypnotic. As with all Julie covers, the art is magnificent--
EXTD=she was such a beauty. In real life, off the album covers, Julie 
EXTD=was a stay-at-home, a voracious reader and a devoted wife and mom
EXTD=She was much beloved by the jazz musicians in Los Angeles for b
EXTD=eing very hip and very congenial. They considered her an excellen
EXTD=t musician, too. She sold zillions of records for Liberty. The ad
