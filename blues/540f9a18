EXTD=This is a compilation of the great R&B organist Dave Lewis, who was very influential in the development of R&B music in the Northwest. He played mostly in a trio format with Drums and Guitar. His playing infuenced a lot of bands that came after, mo
EXTD=st notably the Kingsmen of "Louie Louie" fame. Lewis' most famous song is "Little Green Thing," recorded in the very early 60's in Seattle and picked up by A&M records, who recorded a full LP under the same name. It got a lot of airplay around the 
EXTD=country and was a big regional hit in Seattle.\n\nFor his best work, he teamed with Guitarist Joe Johanson (had some nasty little licks) and drummer Dickey Enfield, who provided a solid rhythm and played a mean shuffle beat. Lewis avoided using the
EXTD="Jimmy Smith" registration on the Hammond for the most part, preferring a richer sound with more upper harmonics and used the tremelo on the Leslie speaker in expert fashion. Although this disc is limited to the R&B songs that were in vogue during
EXTD=that period, he also recorded some nice standards as well. His pedal work is solid and his right hand technique was very good. Though fully capable never gave in to playing an excess of notes to "show off" as did some of his contemporaries. \n\nAl
EXTD=l in all, this collection captures most of Lewis best work with some notable exceptions. This compilation was produced by Jerry Dennon from Jerden Records who recorded Lewis on Jerden Records before A&M picked up the organist. The rumor is that one
EXTD=of Lewis' songs, J.A.J., standing for Jive Ass Jerry, sort of an inside joke on Jerry Dennon. This info submitted by Ralph Matthews, Roseville, CA\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
