EXTD=, 1994, 1996, 1998 Sony Music Entertainment Inc.  \n\nLINER NOTES
EXTD=\n\nEvery young trumpet player has to practice his Arban. Twenty-
EXTD=five years ago in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, at the age of 12, Wyn
EXTD=ton Marsalis practiced it, too - for an hour before he went to \n
EXTD=school, another hour over the course of breaks during the school 
EXTD=day, at least an hour after \nschool was over, and again in the e
EXTD=vening for several hours after he'd finished his homework. \nOn a
EXTD=typical busy day when he was an adolescent, Wynton practiced a t
EXTD=otal of six hours, and \nmuch of that time was devoted to the exe
EXTD=rcises and drills in the 347-page bible of trumpet study \ncalled
EXTD=Arban's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Grande Méthode
EXTD=complète pour \ncornet à pistons et de saxhorn), written by the 
EXTD=famed 19th-century trumpet and cornet player, \nJoseph Jean-Bapti
EXTD=ste Laurent Arban.\n\nAt the end of Arban's big book, a series of
EXTD=fantasies and airs challenge the technical preparation \nand for
EXTD=titude of anyone who wants to call himself a trumpet player. The 
EXTD=hardest of these \nshowpieces is Arban's "Fantasie and Variations
EXTD=on 'The Carnival of Venice,'" a seven-and-a-half \nminute cornet
EXTD=solo of hair-raising slurs, arpeggios, intervals, and difficult 
EXTD=tonguing and intonation. \nArban's "Carnival" calls for superb ph
EXTD=rasing, perfect fingering, and a complete command of the\n instru
EXTD=ment's range and tonal vocabulary. To play it at all is a rite of
EXTD=passage for trumpeters - to \nplay it well is a testimony to a pl
EXTD=ayer's skill and panache. To play it with an artistry that transc
EXTD=ends \nits complexity is something only the greatest players over
EXTD=the years have been able to do.\n\nLuckily, for listeners today,
EXTD=Wynton practiced his Arban hard - very hard - and one of the man
EXTD=y \nrewards is his bravura cornet performance of "Carnival of Ven
EXTD=ice," recorded with the Eastman \nWind Ensemble under the directi
EXTD=on of Donald Hunsberger. That selection, one of four from \nWinto
EXTD=n's 1987 Carnaval disc, included here, represents both a culminat
EXTD=ion and bench mark in \nthe performance of the work. Indeed, on r
EXTD=ecording after recording since his 1983 Grammy Award-\nwinning de
EXTD=but album of three trumpet concertos (which he later re-recorded,
EXTD=in his 1994 London \nConcert, also available on video), Wynton h
EXTD=as been simultaneously summing up and setting a \nnew standard fo
EXTD=r the performance of the entire trumpet repertoire. The rich body
EXTD=of his recorded \nclassical work, preserved on more than a dozen
EXTD=discs and highlighted in this collection by 20 \ndifferent piece
EXTD=s, displays not only startling range but unrivaled musicianship. 
EXTD=With a sensibility \nthat directly addresses the ambiguity of hum
EXTD=an life, Wynton has redefined the ideal of excellence \nin his ar
EXTD=t.\n\n"Wynton simply oozes music from every pore," says his longt
EXTD=ime recording producer, also a \nmultiple Grammy Award-winner, St
EXTD=even Epstein, "As soon as I first heard him play I knew I \nwante
EXTD=d to work with him. To me, he's as close to Mozart as we're ever 
EXTD=going to get."\n\nModestly disavowing the comparison ("that's dis
EXTD=respectful to Mozart"), Marsalis nevertheless \ninspires similar 
EXTD=sentiment from virtually everyone with whom he has played. Organi
EXTD=st and \nconductor Anthony Newman, featured here on three excerpt
EXTD=s from Wynton's best-selling 1996 \ndisc, In Gabriel's Garden, re
EXTD=calls recording sessions that were "so exhilarating... [we] staye
EXTD=d up \nwell into the night discussing the day's work."\n\n"How is
EXTD=my sound?" Wynton repeatedly asks Steve Epstein at all his recor
EXTD=ding sessions. Taken \ntogether, the works that comprise this alb
EXTD=um reveal an incremental preoccupation with that \nquestion. "Fro
EXTD=m the very beginning of my association with him, Wynton's musical
EXTD=ity was innate \nand intuitive," says Epstein. "His technique was
EXTD=already flawless. And his musical ideas were \nright on - he was
EXTD=precocious. With many other artists, if you looked at some early
EXTD=work and then \nsome late, the shift in interpretation is quanti
EXTD=fiable. But with Wynton, what I think you hear evolving \nas you 
EXTD=listen to his complete work up to now is an attention to sound, t
EXTD=o subtle shadings of \nintonation, to nuances of sound production
EXTD=In all my recording with him, Wynton is very much \nconcerned w
EXTD=ith the appropriateness of the sound required for each particular
EXTD=piece. And he's \nvery hard on himself, never satisfied, always 
EXTD=striving for perfection when anyone else listening \nthinks he ha
EXTD=s already achieved it."\n\nIn a speech before the National Press 
EXTD=Club in 1995, Wynton addressed the subject of sound by \nreferrin
EXTD=g, first, to the sound of a particular instrument - in his case, 
EXTD=of course, the trumpet - and \nthen the more elusive sound that "
EXTD=is your sound... the sound of your personality and your attitude 
EXTD=\nbeing projected through your instrument. Now, that sound is a l
EXTD=ot harder to work on, because you \nhave to deal with yourself. A
EXTD=nd in most instances, that's pretty painful."\n\nWynton meant tha
EXTD=t no matter how good you might think you sound, when you compare 
EXTD=yourself \nto the greats of the past you can feel inadequate. ("W
EXTD=ell, it doesn't sound like Louis Armstrong - \nno, it sounds like
EXTD=me, unfortunately.") To grow beyond that perceived inadequacy, t
EXTD=o truly find \nyour own sound, "takes courage, because it means y
EXTD=ou are trying to play in a way that nobody \nelse has played. And
EXTD=of course the reason you wanted to be a musician is because you 
EXTD=liked the \nway somebody played." The inner pain comes from deali
EXTD=ng with the difference between your \nsound and the sound that ma
EXTD=de you aspire to be a musician in the first place.\n\nBut to enco
EXTD=unter the sound of Marsalis' trumpet on this recording is anythin
EXTD=g but painful. From the \nhigh energy and brash polish of his All
EXTD=egro from Vivaldi's Concerto For Two Trumpets and Strings \n(in w
EXTD=hich, remarkably, he plays both trumpet parts) to the delicate be
EXTD=auty of the adagio from M. \nHaydn's Trumpet Concerto - from the h
EXTD=umor and good spirits of Bernstein's "Rondo for Lifey" to \nthe p
EXTD=omp and nobility of Purcell's Trumpet Air from The Indian Queen o
EXTD=r Jeremiah Clarke's "Prince \nof Denmark's March;" and from the l
EXTD=ilting softness of "'Tis the Last Rose of Summer" to the \nabsolu
EXTD=tely breathtaking Allegro Assai that concludes Bach's Brandenburg
EXTD=Concerto No. 2 in F \nMajor, the depth and variety of Wynton's s
EXTD=ound is at once intimate and inspiring.\n\n"There are two things 
EXTD=I strive for in the sound of my playing," Wynton says. "The first
EXTD=thing is to \nbe clear. And the second is to be open."\n\nIn two
EXTD=of the classics that he has recorded a second time, Haydn's Conc
EXTD=erto for Trumpet and \nOrchestra in E-flat Major and Hummel's Con
EXTD=certo for Trumpet and Orchestra in E Major, you can \nimmediately
EXTD=hear that clarity and openness. In the Haydn concerto's finale, 
EXTD=marked Allegro, and \nthe Hummel last movement, Rondo (Allegro mo
EXTD=lto), the sheer sound of Wynton's trumpet conveys \nthe shape and
EXTD=direction, the feeling of the music. Or listen to "Let the Brigh
EXTD=t Seraphim" (from \nHandel's Samson), on Wynton's Baroque Duet wi
EXTD=th Kathleen Battle. By turns delicate and refined, \nbold and vig
EXTD=orous, Wynton's sound stops you short, arresting your attention a
EXTD=nd taking you to \nanother place in your life. Connecting experie
EXTD=nce and emotion, this magnificent sound praises, in \nthe poet W.
EXTD=H. Auden's phrase, "all it can for being."\n\n-Carl Vigeland\nCa
EXTD=rl Vigeland is the co-author, with\nWyton Marsalis, of the forthc
EXTD=oming\n"Jazz in the Bittersweet Blues of Life."\n\n-- last update
