EXTD=G EXPERT REVIEW: Just when you thought that the perfect album and
EXTD=its CD equivalent couldn't get any better, along comes Rhino wit
EXTD=h this 25-song deluxe edition of Dusty in Memphis. The new transf
EXTD=ers on the original Dusty in Memphis material are sharper and bri
EXTD=ghter, but also warmer than the original 1992 CD -- the finely nu
EXTD=anced richness of Dusty Springfield's voice on the softer numbers
EXTD=, such as "In the Land of Make Believe" and "Windmills of Your Mi
EXTD=nd," is captured perfectly on this new edition, where the old CD 
EXTD=had a colder, harder texture. Among the bonus tracks, "What Do Yo
EXTD=u Do When Love Dies" comes from the same sessions as the Memphis 
EXTD=album, and its noninclusion on the original is difficult to expla
EXTD=in, being one of the singer's more exuberant performances and tra
EXTD=cks. The highlight of the bonus tracks, however, are the songs le
EXTD=ft over from sessions for the unfairly underrated Gamble- and Huf
EXTD=f-produced Brand New Me album, and the unissued 1971 Jeff Barry-p
EXTD=roduced sides for a never-released third Atlantic album. If anyth
EXTD=ing, she's more confident and bold on this material than on Dusty
EXTD=in Memphis. The sound is lusher, and heavier as well, but no les
EXTD=s seductive and captivating, and the presence of treasures such a
EXTD=s her covers of David Gates' "Make It With You" and Carole King's
EXTD="You've Got a Friend," the gospel-flavored "Love Shine Down," an
EXTD=d the hard-rocking "Natchez Trace" all serve to make this a must-
EXTD=own CD, even for those who already have the previous versions. On
EXTD=e other nice feature of the new edition is that the clarity of th
EXTD=e remastering brings the backing instruments out as never before,
EXTD=which makes one appreciate the production and arrangements as we
EXTD=ll as her performance. -- Bruce Eder \n \nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (Ori
EXTD=ginal Rhino CD Edition) Sometimes memories distort or inflate the
EXTD=quality of recordings deemed legendary, but in the case of Dusty
EXTD=in Memphis, the years have only strengthened its reputation. The
EXTD=idea of taking England's reigning female soul queen to the home 
EXTD=of the music she had mastered was an inspired one. The Jerry Wexl
EXTD=er/Tom Dowd/Arif Mardin production and engineering team picked mo
EXTD=stly perfect songs, and those that weren't so great were salvaged
EXTD=by Springfield's marvelous delivery and technique. This set has 
EXTD=definitive numbers in "So Much Love," "Son of a Preacher Man," "B
EXTD=reakfast in Bed," "Just One Smile," "I Don't Want to Hear About I
EXTD=t Anymore," and "Just a Little Lovin'" and three bonus tracks: an
EXTD=unreleased version of "What Do You Do When Love Dies," "Willie &
EXTD=Laura Mae Jones" and "That Old Sweet Roll (Hi-De-Ho)." It's trul
EXTD=y a disc deserving of its classic status. -- Ron Wynn\n\nAmazon.c
EXTD=om essential recording\nDusty Springfield never claimed to be a s
EXTD=oul singer, but Dusty in Memphis effects a unique and deeply movi
EXTD=ng synthesis of her brand of stylish pop and the southern R&B of 
EXTD=the late '60s. Her soft tones and hushed, confessional readings m
EXTD=ake for definitive versions of everything from "Son of a Preacher
EXTD=Man" (a later version by Aretha Franklin is good, but less thril
EXTD=lingly sensual than this one) to Randy Newman's ballads "I Don't 
EXTD=Want to Hear It Anymore" and "Just One Smile" to a swirling take 
EXTD=on "The Windmills of Your Mind." The soul obscurity "Breakfast in
EXTD=Bed" even gives a knowing spin to a line from an earlier Dusty c

EXTD=MAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nMemphis Masterpiece, November 13, 2004
EXTD=\nReviewer:    Tom (Toronto, Ontario) \n\nThe endless praise hee
EXTD=ped upon this 1969 album may lead one to think this album is over
EXTD=rated. It's not. 'Dusty in Memphis' deserves every accolade it re
EXTD=ceives. At 11 tracks, it is the peak of Dusty's strength as a voc
EXTD=alist. What makes this album so special is the selection of songs
EXTD=Dusty was reportedly very picky regarding the selection of her 
EXTD=songs (she was a perfectionist in all aspects of her career) but 
EXTD=for this album, it paid off. There is not one track that is fille
EXTD=r, and the more you listen to the album, the more cohesive it bec
EXTD=omes. It's warm, vibrant, sensuous, touching and dramatic, showin
EXTD=g different sides of Dusty - her sexy side on 'Son of a Preacher M
EXTD=an' and 'So Much Love', and her more vulnerable side on 'I Can't 
EXTD=Make It Alone'. She enters diva territory with her reading of 'Th
EXTD=e Windmills of Your Mind'. 'Dusty in Memphis' is a great showcase
EXTD=for songwriters such as Randy Newman, Gerry Goffin and Carole Ki
EXTD=ng, but ultimately, it's Dusty's show. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\n"Memphis" in a class by itself, November 11, 2004 \nReviewe
EXTD=r: T. Norton "still learning..." (key west) \n\nChances are you'v
EXTD=e heard much about this album. Most of it will prove true, but yo
EXTD=u must approach patiently and with an open mind. DO NOT expect Du
EXTD=sty to sound "black" ala Aretha or Whitney. DO expect to hear a w
EXTD=orld-class vocalist pulling out every trick in her bag AND singin
EXTD=g from deep within her soul. \n\nThough the musicians, songwriter
EXTD=s and producers shine here as much as Dusty, let me focus on her.
EXTD=With this album, Dusty perfected the deceptively soft delivery s
EXTD=he had begun with "The Look of Love". For me, this culminates in 
EXTD="No Easy Down", which serves as the moment of resignation in the 
EXTD=rough story line that the songs sketch out. There is no moment of
EXTD=resolution here, and that's part of what makes it so irresistabl
EXTD=y desirable to return to this gem time and time again. It is haun
EXTD=ting and unbelievably beautiful, and will stay under your skin fo
EXTD=r a lifetime if you just let it in.... \n\nRegarding the bonus tr
EXTD=acks on this release: treat them as an academic exercise, letting
EXTD=the annotations in the liner be your guide. Most of these tracks
EXTD=are woefully out of place alongside "Memphis", they were issued 
EXTD=as a gesture to the fans, who knew of their existence but were un
EXTD=able to purchase them before this package emerged. Dusty' s album
EXTD=with Jeff Barry (unreleased at the time of it's conception, but 
EXTD=represented here in it's majority) inspires a whole critique of i
EXTD=t's own. Why did this woman never do a "Black" gospel project? Th
EXTD=e tracks that hint at such potential will haunt you as much as "M
EXTD=emphis"! If you love music, singing, the civil rights movement, a
EXTD=ll things British Invasion, all things romance, all things human.
EXTD=Get Dusty in Memphis and don't look back! Lord knows she never
EXTD=did. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe only one who could ever
EXTD=reach me, May 20, 2004\nReviewer: Andy Agree "jackrabbit79" (Oma
EXTD=ha, NE) \n\nThis album has been "hyped" a lot recently, especiall
EXTD=y with its high ranking in the Rolling Stone list of Top 500 albu
EXTD=ms of all time, and if it hadn't been for all the hype, I never w
EXTD=ould have heard of it. So thanks, Rolling Stone, it really was a 
EXTD=great discovery. Of course anyone who knows Dusty at all knows th
EXTD=e very Memphis-sounding "Son of a Preacher Man". It is the best s
EXTD=ong on the album, the best I ever heard from her. Dusty shines as
EXTD=a soul singer, languorous and sexy, not brassy and bold like fel
EXTD=low "Preacher" singer Aretha Franklin. But only "Preacher" and a 
EXTD=few other tracks truly fit into the Memphis/Muscle Shoals style o
EXTD=f soul. (One of them, "Willie and Laura Mae Jones" was written by
EXTD=Tony Joe White, who brought us the swamp-rock classic "Polk Sala
EXTD=d Annie" and also wrote "Rainy Night in Georgia".) Most other tra
EXTD=cks are from another world entirely, melodic LA/New York pop writ
EXTD=ten by ace songwriters like Randy Newman, Carole King/Gerry Goffi
EXTD=n, Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil and Burt Bacharach, and set more to st
EXTD=rings than to horns. But Dusty herself - not the music per se - i
EXTD=s what transforms this from a pop to a soul album. Unlike today's
EXTD="soul" singers who dish out pre-programmed vocal acrobatics at 1
EXTD=10 decibels, Dusty just sings it the way the writer wrote it, put
EXTD=ting her own sensitivity into every word - and she sends chills r
EXTD=ight down your spine, song after song after song. Just listen, an
EXTD=d you will feel as if she is the only one who could ever reach yo
EXTD=u.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nBrilliant!, January 27, 2004\nR
EXTD=eviewer: J. Zuurbier "holden84" (Canada]\n\nThis is the pivotal a
EXTD=lbum of Dusty Springfield's career, making many "best of" lists. 
EXTD=And it certainly deserves that honor! Just when this album couldn
EXTD='t get any better, you get this Deluxe Edition, which features th
EXTD=e original 11 tracks and a whopping 14 bonus tracks! The original
EXTD=songs have been remastered, and sound pristine and clear, the wa
EXTD=y they were meant to be heard. This version will truly make you e
EXTD=xperience the album, and appreciate the arrangements, production 
EXTD=and overall quality of Dusty's vocals.\n\nThere is an abundance o
EXTD=f bonus material that was previously unissued, including her insp
EXTD=ired cover of Carole King's "You've Got A Friend", "Have A Good L
EXTD=ife Baby", "Cherished", "Goodbye", "Make It With You", "All The K
EXTD=ing's Horses", "Natchez Trace", "Live Here With You" and "Love Sh
EXTD=ine Down". That already makes it a must own, for all that bonus r
EXTD=are material!\n\nBut the tracks that actually make up the DUSTY I
EXTD=N MEMPHIS part of the album, that is worth raving about. From the
EXTD=opening "Just A Little Lovin", this album is perfect as your sou
EXTD=ndtrack to a lazy afternoon. I agree with the reviewer who pointe
EXTD=d out that "Windmills of My Mind" may be her most underrated perf
EXTD=ormance. Of course everyone is familiar with the classic "Son of 
EXTD=a Preacher Man". It's the quieter songs that show Dusty's power i
EXTD=n my opinion, on songs like "So Much Love" and "I Don't Want To H
EXTD=ear It Anymore", her nuanched performances really bring the mater
EXTD=ial out. The same could be said on tracks like "Just One Smile" o
EXTD=r "No Easy Way Down", and more uptempo songs like "Don't Forget A
EXTD=bout Me" or "Breakfast In Bed".\n\nOverall, this is an excellent 
EXTD=edition to own, of a classic album. Every Dusty Springfield colle
EXTD=ction should have at least this album in it!\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOM
EXTD=ER REVIEW\nDusty Springfield's masterpiece., July 26, 2001\nRevie
EXTD=wer: "bluemamma" (San Luis Obispo, CA USA) \n\nI was 11 years old
EXTD=when the British Invasion brought Dusty Springfield a string of 
EXTD=pop hits, and I thought she was just about the coolest thing on e
EXTD=arth. I bought every one of her singles. But by the time this alb
EXTD=um came out in 1969, I was a teenager and thought I'd outgrown he
EXTD=r music along with go-go boots and white lipstick. I wasn't even 
EXTD=listening to Top 40 radio anymore by that time (preferring "under
EXTD=ground" stations that played Joplin and Hendrix), so I didn't hea
EXTD=r "Son of a Preacher Man" until it turned up on the oldies statio
EXTD=ns a couple of decades later.\n\nBut this album hung on. I kept h
EXTD=earing musicians I had a lot of respect for cite it as one of the
EXTD=masterpieces of the 60s, and thought I must be hearing wrong. Du
EXTD=sty Springfield? The girl with the big hair and inch-thick eyelin
EXTD=er?\n\nYeah. Dusty Springfield. I don't know if there's anybody l
EXTD=eft who still thinks of her as a lightweight pop singer, but if t
EXTD=here is, give them this album. Among the 11 tracks that make up t
EXTD=he original album are songs with some of the deepest, most soulfu
EXTD=l singing you've ever heard this side of Aretha Franklin. (Dusty'
EXTD=s version of "Son of a Preacher Man" is even BETTER than Aretha's
EXTD=!) Not just "Preacher Man," but "So Much Love," "Don't Forget Abo
EXTD=ut Me," "No Easy Way Down" and "I Can't Make It Alone" are just p
EXTD=ure, classic Memphis soul. And even when she takes on a song that
EXTD=couldn't really be described as "soul" like Randy Newman's movin
EXTD=g ballad, "I Don't Want To Hear It Anymore," or the sly and sexy 
EXTD="Breakfast In Bed" she brings a soulfulness to them that they wou
EXTD=ldn't have if anyone else did them. Even "Windmills of Your Mind"
EXTD=ï¿½ a song that every other singer I've ever heard has managed t
EXTD=o make both bland and pretentious ï¿½ is lovely when Dusty sings 
EXTD=it.\n\nAnd that's just the original album. The Deluxe edition add
EXTD=ed 13 bonus tracks. Most bonus tracks are just some junk tacked o
EXTD=n to make you believe you're getting more for your money. These a
EXTD=re every bit as good as the original album. I would have cut "Che
EXTD=rished" ï¿½ not really a terrible song, but not quite up to Sprin
EXTD=gfield standards. But everything else is fabulous. "That Old Swee
EXTD=t Roll" (yes, the Blood, Sweat and Tears song) and "Goodbye" are 
EXTD=especially good. And "Natchez Trace" was a revelation. Who knew D
EXTD=usty Springfield could rock? \n\nI'm just sorry it took me so lon
EXTD=g to find this album.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nStyle and Vi

EXTD=his is probably one of the most important 100 albums in popular m
EXTD=usic, and in the top-10 for female artists. I'd prefer not to cal
EXTD=l it a "masterpiece," but the album's influence is undeniable. Co
EXTD=nsider 1969. Berry Gordy, Jr. of Motown shaped and molded his gir
EXTD=l groups to make them acceptable for mass audiences. Phil Specter
EXTD='s girl groups were a "studio" creation. And country music had no
EXTD=patience for any female singer other than the standard "stand-by
EXTD=your-man" variety.\n\nEnter Dusty Springfield. The Londoner with
EXTD=a passion for soul music goes to Memphis to record an album. She
EXTD='s production savvy, and has a clear vision of the way that she w
EXTD=ants her music to sound. At a time when females were barely toler
EXTD=ated as performers, Dusty has her way in the studio, and the resu
EXTD=lt is "Dusty's sound," and not the work the Memphis producers. In
EXTD=other words, Dusty in Memphis moved control of the musical creat
EXTD=ive process from the "hit makers" to the performer. Initially, th
EXTD=e album sold poorly. It wasn't until years later that critics and
EXTD=fans were ready to take female vocalists seriously. Dusty In Mem
EXTD=phis showcases a women who established her own sense of style and
EXTD=followed her own musical vision. The music of Dusty Springfield 
EXTD=is hers and hers alone. And in the history of popular music - tha
EXTD=t's a milestone.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDon't be fooled..
EXTD=, June 3, 2000\nReviewer: S. Gallup "starhead" (Moss Beach, CA U
EXTD=SA) \n\nThe revisionist history being espoused by rock critics em
EXTD=braces this one as a long lost gem. Actually it is a sickly sweet
EXTD=sounding bit of pop poop with maybe two good songs on it. When t
EXTD=he strings aren't sending you into a diabetic coma you might catc
EXTD=h a whiff of a couple of excellent songs like "Preacher Man". Bas
EXTD=ically these are interpretations of other people's songs and I can'
EXTD=t for the life of me understand why this soul-less wonder is bein
EXTD=g lauded as a classic. There is plenty of great soul out there, b
EXTD=ut this ain't it folks...\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDIM is D
EXTD=usty at her very best, March 23, 2000\nReviewer: Larry Launstein,
EXTD=Jr. (Flushing, MI USA) \n\nDusty Springfield was at her creative
EXTD=and vocal peak in Dusty In Memphis. Sure, there was the big hit,
EXTD="Son Of A Preacher Man", one of the best known of all Dusty song
EXTD=s. However, I will agree with Dusty's own comments in the liner n
EXTD=otes when she says the song "I Don't Want To Hear It Anymore" is 
EXTD=her favorite. She shows the entire vocal range she can command in
EXTD=this song, and the result is absolutely gorgeous. I also flat-ou
EXTD=t love "Windmills Of Your Mind", "Just A Little Lovin'", "In The 
EXTD=Land Of Make Believe" and "I Can't Make It Alone". For that matte
EXTD=r, the entire original 11 tracks are Dusty in her very best form.
EXTD=The fact that she leaned heavily on the Caro King/David Goffin, 
EXTD=Burt Bacharach/Hal David songwriting teams and Randy Newman for m
EXTD=aterial in this recording does not in any way detract from Dusty'
EXTD=s efforts, in fact it enhances them. Dusty invented the entire wa
EXTD=y she sang, but the rest is God-given, and we are much better for
EXTD=her having been among us.\n\nThe role of the Memphis Cats cannot
EXTD=be understated, either. I just love horn bands, being a Chicago 
EXTD=fan since 1972, and it is no coincidence to me that DIM came out 
EXTD=at the same time as Chicago Transit Authority. DIM hinted at the 
EXTD=integrated horn and rythim section that became Chicago's hallmark
EXTD=, while maintaining some classic orchestration as well. Chicago w
EXTD=ould also emulate some of these classic orchestration elements fo
EXTD=und in DIM.\n\nAs for the bonus tracks, personally, I love every 
EXTD=one of them, even if some do not quite fit in with the original D
EXTD=IM theme. However, "Willie And Laura Mae Jones", "That Old Sweet 
EXTD=Roll (Hi-De-Ho") and "I'll Be Faithful" sound like they would hav
EXTD=e fit in the original DIM very nicely. And "Willie And Laura Mae 
EXTD=Jones" and "Natchez Trace" show a rare side of Dusty, the side th
EXTD=at can rock-out with anyone.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nStone
EXTD=Sexy, July 1, 1999\nReviewer: A music fan\n\nI cannot praise eit
EXTD=her this album or Dusty Springfield enough. Listening to the firs
EXTD=t track alone, "Just A Little Lovin'" is enough to tell you that 
EXTD=this woman knows and expresses everything there is to know about 
EXTD=love. What's more, she does it with sublime subtlety: a wink and 
EXTD=a sly smile as opposed to a modern so-called "Diva" like Whitney 
EXTD=Houston, who'd bash you over the head. True style as opposed to g
EXTD=audy excess. There's not a bad song on the album, and several tru
EXTD=e classics. But listen to it several times before you form a judg
EXTD=ement: that subtlety needs time to work its magic and insinuate i
EXTD=tself into your soul. I always thought "Windmills of Your Mind" w
EXTD=as dreary 60's muzak until I heard her masterly epic version. And
EXTD=no matter how many times I hear it, chills go up my spine when s
EXTD=he sings the words, "He don't really love her" in Randy Newman's 
EXTD="I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore". Hell, nobody can sing the word
EXTD="baby" and express as many emotions through it as Dusty did. She
EXTD=is sorely missed!\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nCan I Give It M

EXTD=ell "patricko@escape.com" (NYC) \n\nThis is the recording that fi
EXTD=nally made me understand the difference between an "artist" and a
EXTD=popular singer. The songs on this CD nearly all sound like they 
EXTD=could have been recorded in the '90s, not in 1969. Most people wi
EXTD=ll only know "Son of a Preacher Man," but that isn't even my favo
EXTD=rite cut on the album. This CD has been an influence to a lot of 
EXTD=other artists, some of whom have credited it. Elvis Costello call
EXTD=ed it the second greatest album released on Atlantic in the '60s,
EXTD=second only to Aretha Franklin's debut album. It is an amazing c
EXTD=ombination of soul, perfect production and an artist who always c
EXTD=ared deeply about the quality of her work. I've got tons of music
EXTD=, most of it from current artists, but this is one of my top five
