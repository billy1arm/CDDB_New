EXTD=ND 1973 COMPLETE RECORDINGS, April 7, 2009\nBy Stuart Jefferson (
EXTD=San Diego, CA]\n\nNine discs - 61,69, 55,67, 61,57, 57,57, 79 min
EXTD=utes each approximately. The original release contained a "bonus"
EXTD=disc (77 minutes) from Cincinatti on 12-04-73 not now included i
EXTD=n this release. This concert comes from two-track tapes. The soun
EXTD=d doesn't have the "openess" and dimensionality of other Dead rel
EXTD=eases. Saying that, this is probably the best sounding two-track 
EXTD=recordings you'll ever hear. Tracks range from"Me and Bobby McGhe
EXTD=e" to "Row Jimmy" to "China Cat Sunflower" to "Playing In the Ban
EXTD=d" to "Weather Report Suite" to "Truckin'" to "Promised Land" to 
EXTD="Dark Star"-those familiar with the band will get the picture.\n\n
EXTD=Let's get it out right now - this will probably stand as one of t
EXTD=he finest "live" sets the group has ever released. However, it's 
EXTD=a different group than from even a year or so ago. A listen to th
EXTD=e lengthy DARK STAR on this set is DARK STAR but it's something e
EXTD=lse too. Read on.\n\nThese recordings are testament to the growth
EXTD=of the Grateful Dead. Often dismissed as stuck in the "sixties",
EXTD=the Dead had quietly continued to evolve. Gone are the totally p
EXTD=sychedelic flashes found in their own, and in others,compositions
EXTD=Yes, the Garcia knife-edge guitar sound, the under-pinning yet 
EXTD=out-front bass work of Lesh, the drum/percussion foundation of Kr
EXTD=eutzmann,and the subtle keyboards of Keith Godchaux are all prese
EXTD=nt. But there is something more - the Dead have matured, moved on
EXTD=in their playing. As I wrote, listen to DARK STAR on disc nine. 
EXTD=Compare it to other recordings from even a year previously. It's 
EXTD=DARK STAR but it's also something else entirely. Even given the n
EXTD=ature of the band to constantly improvise - this is something new
EXTD=\n\nThis set (the only one the band played at Winterland in 1973
EXTD=) shows a "newer" Dead - one that's totally at ease within a numb
EXTD=er of genres -- especially their take on country music. The band 
EXTD=sounds very at ease with this new approach to their music which b
EXTD=ecomes apparent from the start of this release. The musical peaks
EXTD=and valleys the Dead like to travel through are still there but 
EXTD=there are subtle changes at work. The acid-twinkle, the tricks an
EXTD=d turnarounds within the compositions are still there, but there 
EXTD=is a maturity, a subtle,more straight forward shifting of approac
EXTD=h to their music. A shift that only a band who has been together 
EXTD=for a number of years, that have had it's share of ups and downs,
EXTD=is capable of.\n\nThe band's identity was changing and growing. 
EXTD=A close look at the song titles show that most of the composition
EXTD=s are relatively new,but are songs the band would continue to pla
EXTD=y -- by and large -- into the future. This growth was self-induce
EXTD=d but was also forced on them as their world (and ours) changed -
EXTD=sometimes for better, sometimes not. It's interesting to note th
EXTD=at it was only a year (1972) past when the Dead played in Europe 
EXTD=(documented on EUROPE '72 and other sets) playing pretty much the
EXTD=ir then standard set. Then change became evident in the band. The
EXTD=ir new studio album, WAKE OF THE FLOOD, was released in 1973, pri
EXTD=or to this three night stand. Also in 1973 the band played at the
EXTD=giant Watkins Glen venue to many hundreds of thousands of people
EXTD=which left an impression on the band. It was also the year tha
EXTD=t Ron "Pigpen" McKernan died, which was a blow not only to the ba
EXTD=nd as a whole, but to Garcia, who considered Pigpen to be the def
EXTD=acto leader of the group. Bob Weir was coming to the forefront, b
EXTD=oth on vocals and song writing. All of these things had an effect
EXTD=on the band's playing.\n\nIn listening to this set, there is no 
EXTD=real immediate feel of "gotcha" within a lot of their new materia
EXTD=l that the Dead, in earlier years, were known for. The band, both
EXTD=in feel and in actual tempo, seem to be holding back, and holdin
EXTD=g back-- until there is finally a release of musical energy. The 
EXTD=playing, as a whole, is much better, more "professional" (a funny
EXTD=word for the Dead), but the fireworks, the sense of wild abandon
EXTD=ment of the past seems to be gone to some extent. Don't get me wr
EXTD=ong - this is one of my favorite sets from the band. I'm basing t
EXTD=his on having heard the band, both live (those were the days) and
EXTD=on record from the days when they had just changed their name fr
EXTD=om The Warlocks to the Grateful Dead. From the days when Garcia d
EXTD=idn't have a beard, up through hearing them in 1973. There are pl
EXTD=enty of transcendent moments captured on these discs. More mature
EXTD=definitely, but still containing that "good old Grateful Dead" s
EXTD=ound and musical trickery they are known for.\n\nIf you're new to
EXTD=the Dead experience, you should probably look elsewhere if you w
EXTD=ant to know what the Dead were like early on. If you're a long ti
EXTD=me listener - this will do nicely.\n\nThe packaging is sumptuous 
EXTD=a box about five by five inches with a folding lid. Each disc i
EXTD=s in it's own cardboard sleeve in a tri-fold booklet. Included is
EXTD=a Grateful Dead pin and a folded mailer with verse and a cartoon
EXTD=The booklet is informative about both the era and this collecti
EXTD=on. There is even an explanation on the technology used on these 
EXTD=recordings. All in all a nice presentation.\n\nTo back up my poin
EXTD=t about how the band has changed, I played a number of tracks fro
EXTD=m both the Fillmore in 1969 and tracks from Europe in 1972, then 
EXTD=listened to this collection. It's proof positive of, if I may use
EXTD=a much quoted phrase,"what a long strange trip it's been". And i
EXTD=t's a trip with this releases help that listeners will want to ta
EXTD=ke again and again. Get it while you can. This is a warm, fine re
EXTD=lease. It's like getting a gift from friends.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM C

EXTD=e right price for this product. Anything much more and you are su
EXTD=bject to the problem that loyal Grateful Dead fans share--we are 
EXTD=likely to buy anything the Band and Rhino issues, almost regardle
EXTD=ss of the price. First the good news. The set lists from these 19
EXTD=73 shows are wonderful, and the performances themselves are excel
EXTD=lent, from an excellent year for the Band. All the classics from 
EXTD=this period are here, and of course comparing the three shows is 
EXTD=great fun. The Saturday night effort is particularly stellar. Now
EXTD=the bad news. Take very seriously the subtle warning that these 
EXTD=concerts were recorded on two-track tape. Even the recent enginee
EXTD=ring efforts to bring these tapes alive are disappointing. Althou
EXTD=gh the sound from the instruments is acceptably clear, the Band's
EXTD=voices are mostly lost in the mix. Bobby, in particular, sounds 
EXTD=like he is singing in a long, distant, tunnel. The packaging cann
EXTD=ot make up for the sound. Imagine some of the weaker engineering 
EXTD=efforts from "Dick's Picks" or "Road Trips," and you get the idea
EXTD=If you want to hear the Dead at Winterland from this time perio
EXTD=d, you are much better off buying the five-CD Dead "Movie Soundtr
EXTD=ack" from 1974. You will save a lot of money, hear the same songs
EXTD=, and benefit from superior engineering and recording technology.
EXTD=\n\nNote: Since I wrote this review, Rhino and the Band issued th
EXTD=eir Winterland 1977 three-night CD set. This is a magnificant col
EXTD=lection that is constantly on my CD player. There are none of the
EXTD=sound/recording problems that I found on the 1973 set, which I n
EXTD=ever listen to anymore. 5 stars. You will truly enjoy listening t

EXTD=d, April 7, 2009\nBy Philip S. Wolf (SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, CA. USA\n\n
EXTD=This nine CD set of a three night run at Winterland, San Francisc
EXTD=o is the type of release the Deadheads have been shouting for....
EXTD=well, for years now. 1973, was a transitional year in GD history.
EXTD=On March 8, news of the passing of Pigpen, meant that the old da
EXTD=ys were now gone forever. The band, played gigs mostly on the eas
EXTD=t coast of the USA, with only two shows played in the Bay Area, p
EXTD=rior to this Winterland stand. "Bear's Choice" was released in Ju
EXTD=ly. Taken from The Fillmore East shows of Feb 1970, "Choice" was 
EXTD=as close to a tribute for Pigpen, that the band would ever bring 
EXTD=out. "Bear's Choice" also completed The Grateful Dead's commitmen
EXTD=t to Warner Brothers Records, and in October, "Wake Of The Flood"
EXTD=became the first release from Grateful Dead Records.\n\nAway fro
EXTD=m home since May, this November three night stand at Winterland i
EXTD=s a begining of sorts. Along with the new songs from WOTF, the st
EXTD=yle of the band's playing had evolved yet again with a more jazz 
EXTD=influnced sound.\n\nWith tunes such as: "Eyes Of The World" and "We
EXTD=ather Report Suite," The Dead, approached this new music with a c
EXTD=onfident swing and swagger. Old chestnuts such as: "Dark Star" and 
EXTD="Playing In The Band" take on brand new forms and shapes, and dee
EXTD=p space is reached in their center.\n\nOld favorites: "Truckin", 
EXTD="Uncle John's Band" and "Sugar Magnolia" can be found right here 
EXTD=in this box, but like newer tunes: "Row Jimmy" and "Stella Blue" 
EXTD=they are used as ingredients in this great big musical stew pot. 
EXTD=These shows are amongst some of the longest concerts that the ban
EXTD=d would perform. 1973, is considered by many to one of the very b
EXTD=est years of live Grateful Dead music. These nine CD's will begin
EXTD=to define just what all the fuss is about.\n\nThis Winterland bo
EXTD=x was originally released by The Grateful Dead, at their offical 
EXTD=website in March, 2008. An extra "bonus" disc from Cincinnati Gar
EXTD=dens, Ohio, 4 December 1973, was a part of that package. That ext
EXTD=ra CD, was a wonderful addition, to an already good box set. That
EXTD=bonus disc, still recieves lot's of play on my CD machine...but,
EXTD=alas it is NOT included herein.\n\nThis Winterland box, is accur
EXTD=ate document of live GD music as performed almost 36 years ago. T
EXTD=he "Stash Box" package is nice as well. The Dead Head mailer, cir
EXTD=ca October 73, is a nice touch as well. This is a very nice packa
EXTD=ge containing over ten hours of vintage Grateful Dead music. This
EXTD=Winterland run, proves why it takes more than just one concert, 
EXTD=to absorb, this beast we call The Grateful Dead. For the faithful
EXTD=followers of these live GD shows, we now have three COMPLETE sho
EXTD=ws to dig into. This is a great box taken from a key period of li
EXTD=ve Grateful Dead music. The "bonus" CD is sorely missed here.\nFo

EXTD=By jam2009 "Jm" (Western Mass.]\n\nThere's already a lot of great
EXTD=reviews and breakdown of this box set. I agree with most that th
EXTD=is collection sounds great and covers the dead again playing in a
EXTD=peak period. Like most who listen to the whole body of the dead,
EXTD=we all have periods that we prefer more than others. Personally,
EXTD=I find that not being that excited about some periods, makes it 
EXTD=interesting, as I'll come across something that I'd had low expec
EXTD=tations for and have my eyes forced open again with just how tale
EXTD=nted the dead were, even at times where their pilot light seemed 
EXTD=to just flickering.\n\nWith that being, 72-74 are very special ye
EXTD=ars in my love of the dead. Not that I hold these as their best, 
EXTD=but any arguement of their pinnacle years must include these year
EXTD=s. For me 73 holds a special spot, as it was a time that Keith va
EXTD=ulted forward and became a much larger presence in their sound. H
EXTD=e had a role in the 72 shows, but on most nights, he's in the bac
EXTD=kground and seemingly searching for a role that the band felt com
EXTD=fortable with.\n\nJerry's sound will always be a signature that t
EXTD=he band will be associated with and justifiably so. He single han
EXTD=dily created an aura and mood that one a few others have ever app
EXTD=roached with any instrument. He however, needed musicians around 
EXTD=him to stimulate his senses to explore new territories. This is n
EXTD=ot to take anything away from his Bandmates, they were the perfec
EXTD=t fit and all seemed to explore new directions that only got bett
EXTD=er and better. Which brings me to Keith. For the life of me I can
EXTD=not figure out why some have a hard time with his contributions. 
EXTD=All the others in the band have garnered mostly untarnished statu
EXTD=s and appropriatly so, but Keith has always seemed to the one som
EXTD=e find fault with. Maybe, it was his slow decline, before being t
EXTD=hrown out the band, but I for one love his playing and always see
EXTD=k out shows where he has a big role. Which brings this review to 
EXTD=this 3 show collection.\n\nThese shows collectively are awesome. 
EXTD=The sound is clean, separated and warm. The band is in full confi
EXTD=dence of their sound and you can almost feel how much fun they we
EXTD=re having in challenging themselves to find new magic in almost e
EXTD=very song. Keith is no longer a support player, but fully integra
EXTD=ted and allowed to drive the lead in numerous songs. I'll admit, 
EXTD=I have a very soft spot for great keyboards and Keith has always 
EXTD=been one of my favorite players. This is not to say he was the ma
EXTD=in focus of these recordings, only that the dead had added anothe
EXTD=r layer where they could continue to expand their sound. These se
EXTD=ts cover most of their standard greats of their catalog and you w
