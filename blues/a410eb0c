EXTD=SYMPHONIES - CONCERTOS - SERENADES\n\nThe Mozart Experience II\n\nErik Smith\n\n\n\nSymphonies 31, 35, and 36\n\n\n\nOn 3 July 1778, soon after his arrival is Paris, Mozart\n\nwrote to his father that he had been asked to write a \n\nsymphony to ope
EXTD=n the season of the famous Concert \n\nSpirituel.  After the first rehearsal he was so dissatisfied\n\nand angry that he at first decided not to attend the concert\n\nat all, but then, because the weather had improved, he\n\ndecided to go along but 
EXTD=determined, if things went badly,\n\nto take the first violinist's instrument out of his hands and\n\nconduct himself.  He prayed that all might go well and it \n\ndid: great applause followed a brilliant passage in the\n\nfirst Allegro and again wh
EXTD=en the same music returned\n\nnear the end of the movement.  The audience liked the\n\nAndante too and above all the last Allegro.  Finales in\n\nParis usually began with a loud unison, so Mozart opened\n\nhis with just the violins playing piano for
EXTD=eight bars;\n\neverybody said "sh", as he had expected they would,\n\nthen burst into applause at the forte entry.  After the \n\nconcert he went to the Palais Royal for an ice cream to\n\ncelebrate.  But later on the day that he sent this report\n
EXTD=\nto his hather he had to write to a family friend in Salzburg\n\nasking him to break the news to his father that his mother,\n\nwho had accompanied him to Paris, had died that evening.\n\n\n\nThe "Paris" Symphony was in the three-movement form of \
EXTD=n\nthe Italian Overture, but Mozart was not consistent about\n\nthe number of movements: the Symphony NO. 35, \n\ncomposed in Vienna in 1782 and hurriedly sent to \n\nSalzburg to feature at a festivity of the prominent Haffner\n\nfamily, was in four
EXTD=movements and also had a march for the\n\norchestra to be played as the audience arrived, in the \n\ntradition of open-air music.  "The first movement must be\n\nreally fiery, the last as fast as possible" were Mozart's\n\ninstructions.  The first 
EXTD=movement is a very powerful piece,\n\nbuilt almost entirely out of the striking rhythm of the \n\nopening five bars.  The Andante and minuetare in the\n\nrelaxed, happy mood of the Salzburg serenades and the \n\nfinale has great brilliance, with mor
EXTD=e than a touch of \n\nopera buffa humour.\n\n\n\nMozart performed some of his Salzburg works in Vienna,\n\nsometimes cutting out movements to make a symphony out\n\nof a six-movement serenade, but also adding instruments\n\nif he had them to hand, l
EXTD=ike flutes and clarinets he put into\n\nthe outer movements of the "Haffner" Symphony.  He\n\nperformed it before the emperor ("How delighted he was!\n\nHow he applauded me!") and for good measure gave the\n\nfollowing programme: after the first thr
EXTD=ee movements of the\n\n"Haffner" Symphony, two piano concertos, four arias and\n\nthree improvisations by Mozart on the piano, ending the\n\nconcert with the Finale of the "Haffner" Symphony!\n\n\n\nIn 1783 Mozart travelled to Salzburg to introduce 
EXTD=his wife\n\nto his father and sister.  After three months they returned\n\nto Vienna in a leisurly manner.  When they arrive in Linz\n\nthe composer was asked to give a concert in five days'\n\ntime.  "Because I have not got a single symphony with m
EXTD=e\n\nI am composing a new one with all haste".  He somehow \n\nfound time to write not just four movements but a wonderful\n\nsolumn adagio to open the symphony, the first time he\n\nused an introduction in the manner of Joseph and Michael\n\nHaydn.
EXTD=Like so much of his music the "Linz" Symphony\n\nhas two contrasting sides - on the one hand the festive,\n\nassertive C major character with trumpets and timpani\n\nadding solemnity even to the slow movement, on the other\n\nhand a soft, mysterio
EXTD=us, chromatic, questioning side, which\n\nenters in the fourth bar of the introduction and again in the\n\nF minor passage of the slow movement (starting with the\n\npiano staccato on low strings and bassoons).\n\n\n\nPiano Concertos\n\n\n\nOf the w
