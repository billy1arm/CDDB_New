EXTT3=Lyrics:\n\n**Go Ahead and Cry**\n\nLove can change a young boy into a man\nBut a broken heart can change a man back into a boy again\n\nYou're not the first man to cry when things have gone wrong\nYou're only human, you're only so strong\n\nIt take
EXTT3=s more than a tear to knock a big man down\nIt takes more, broken heart to keep him down on the ground\nIt takes three little words to make him stand again\nSo cry, go ahead and cry, go ahead and cry, cry\n\nLove is so easy to play but so hard to r
EXTT3=ead\nYou're still a young man, your heart will love again\n\nIt takes more, little kiss from her sweet tender lips\nIt takes more, gentle touch from her soft finger tips\nIt takes more than one tear to mend a broken heart\nSo cry, go ahead and cry,
EXTT3=go ahead and cry, cry\n\nGo ahead, go ahead, go ahead and cry\nI want you to get down on your knees and cry\nKneel down, kneel down and cry\nWhen you're feeling blue I want you to cry\nDon't be ashamed to cry, go ahead and cry\n
