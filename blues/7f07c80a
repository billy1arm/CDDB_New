EXTD=ve, this is the album for you! If you've never heard how down and
EXTD=dirty the sinister minister from Memphis could get, this record 
EXTD=will change your mind about Al Green. Sure, "Tired Of Being Alone
EXTD=" is a sweet soul classic and "God Is Standing By" is a beautiful
EXTD=cover of a Johnnie Taylor gospel tune, but the rest of the track
EXTD=s just ooze grit, sweat and soul. "Are You Lonely For Me Baby" is
EXTD=incredible! Hard and pleading. "I Can't Get Next To You" should be
EXTD=known to those who have Al's Greatest Hits, but how many of you 
EXTD=have heard the remainder of this LP? Every single under-appreciat
EXTD=ed track here is an absolute gem. "You Say It" is Al Green in low
EXTD=down funky James Brown mode. "I'm A Ram" and "Driving Wheel" are 
EXTD=blistering blues-based workouts. "Right Now Right Now" is wah-wah
EXTD=soaked atmospheric funk. "All Because" ends the album with maybe
EXTD=the finest funk/soul performance of Rev. Green's early career. O
EXTD=f course, that's just my opinion, but you'd have to agree that th
EXTD=ese lesser-known tracks are equal to many of the big hits. And I 
EXTD=haven't even mentioned what this man does with "Light My Fire". I
