EXTD=y become relevant. This two-record set, the product of almost two years' labor, is the band's Tommy, Beggar's Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one: Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bid for artistic respectability.\n\nIn a virtual recapitulation
EXTD=of the group's career, Physical Graffiti touches all the bases. There's a blues ("In My Time of Dying") and a cosmic-cum-heavy ballad ("In the Light") - there's an acoustic interlude ("Bron-Y-Aur") and lots of bludgeoning hard rock, still this band's
EXTD=forte ("Houses of the Holy," "The Wanton Song") - there are also hints of Bo Diddley ("Custard Pie"), Burt Bacharach ("Down by the Seaside") and Kool and the Gang ("Trampled under Foot"). If nothing else, Physical Graffiti is a tour de force.\n\nThe 
EXTD=album's -- and the band's--mainspring is Jimmy Page, guitarist extraordinaire. It was Page who formed Led Zeppelin in 1968, after the model of such guitar-oriented blues-rock units as Cream, the Jeff Beck Group and the Yardbirds, where Page, a former
EXTD=sessionman, had first come to prominence. And it is Page who continues to chart Zeppelin's contemporary course, not only as the group's lead guitarist, but also as the band's producer.\n\nHis primary concern, both as producer and guitarist, is sound
EXTD=His playing lacks the lyricism of Eric Clapton, the funk of Jimi Hendrix, the rhythmic flair of Peter Townshend - but of all the virtuoso guitarists of the Sixties, Page, along with Hendrix, has most expanded the instrument's sonic vocabulary.\n\nHe
EXTD=has always exhibited a studio musician's knack for functionalism. Unlike many of his peers, he rarely overplays, especially on record (and Led Zeppelin has never indulged itself with a live LP). Most of his playing instead evidences the restraint an
EXTD=d rounded style of his avowed influences: the brooding, involuted blues lines of Otis Rush, the finely filigreed acoustic form of Bert Jansch, the echoed, subliminally driving accompaniments of Scotty Moore (behind Elvis Presley) and James Burton (be
EXTD=hind Ricky Nelson) on early rockabilly records.\n\nA facile soloist, Page excels at fills, obbligatos and tags. Playing off stock riffs, he modulates sonorities, developing momentum by modifying instrumental colors. To this end, he uses a wide array 
EXTD=of effects, including on Physical Graffiti some echoed slide ("Time of Dying"), a countryish vibrato ("Seaside"), even a swimming, clear tone reminiscent of Lonnie Mack (the solo on "The Rover"). But his signature remains distortion. Avoiding "clean"
EXTD=timbres, Page usually pits fuzzed out overtones against a hugely recorded bottom, weaving his guitar in and out of the total mix, sometimes echoing Robert Plant's contorted screams, sometimes tunneling behind a dryly thudding drum.\n\nPage's instrum
EXTD=ental cohorts are John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Jones, another studio veteran, contributes keyboards as well as bass and is responsible, via his use of synthesizer, for bringing fullness as well as funk to the band. Bonham, on the other hand, is a
EXTD=steak-and-potatoes percussionist, handpicked, one assumes, for his ability to supply a plodding, stolid, rock-solid bottom -- no one has ever accused Led Zeppelin of swinging.\n\nFronting the band onstage and sharing the spotlight with Page is vocal
EXTD=ist Robert Plant. Like the Who's Roger Daltrey, he is a singer of limited range and feeling, but he projects himself with an irrepressible flair. Plant's acrobatics in fact complement Page's preoccupation with sound. Not only does Plant warble limply
EXTD=as well as scream, he also adds yet another gravelly component to the band. In his production of Plant, Page constantly plays on this grittiness, the vocal counterpart to the distorted sound of his own guitar.\n\nAlthough Zeppelin at the outset hewe
EXTD=d closely to the standard blues-rock format of the late Sixties, the band soon abandoned blues retreads to concentrate on their own brand of hard rock. The group's first album, Led Zeppelin, already contained such departures as "Dazed and Confused," 
EXTD=a searing wall of sound that inspired a generation of heavy-metal rockers. "Communication Breakdown," also on the first LP, showed off the uptempo side of the Zeppelin format, with Page unleashing a blizzard of choppy chords. The jerky meter and crud
EXTD=e attack remain favorite devices of Page, who, like Leiber and Stoller with the Coasters, understands the art of contriving a raucous sound (consider "Rock and Roll," Zeppelin's other masterpiece of distilled freneticism).\n\nThanks to Page's productio
EXTD=n, Led Zeppelin quickly outdistanced such predecessors as Cream and the Yardbirds. Not only was Plant a stronger singer than the Yardbirds' Keith Relf, but Page, in contrast to Clapton, Bruce and Baker, grasped the importance of crafting a coherent e
EXTD=nsemble approach. Taking his cues from old Sun and Chess records, he used reverb and echo to mold the band into a unit, always accenting the bottom (bass and drums), always aiming at the biggest possible sound. As a result, Zeppelin's early records s
EXTD=till sound powerful, while Cream tracks like "White Room" in retrospect sound pale and disjointed. On such classics as "Whole Lotta Love," Page's production set new standards for recording hard rock.\n\nBy 1971 and the release of the fourth Led Zeppe
EXTD=lin album, Page and the band had broadened their approach to include acoustic ballads and folk-derived material, a side of the band introduced on Led Zeppelin III. "Stairway to Heaven," the band's most popular song, delicately balanced acoustic and e
EXTD=lectric elements before climaxing in a patented fuzz assault. Plant's controlled singing and Page's development of texture both distinguish this track, which to this day confounds critics who denigrate Zeppelin as a band schooled only in the art of e
EXTD=xcess.\n\nBut in fact an attention to detail and a sense of economy and nuance have become hallmarks of the Zeppelin style. "Four Sticks," from Led Zeppelin IV, to take a trifling example, sustains momentum by alternating a distorted electric riff wi
EXTD=th an acoustic progression doubled on keyboards. The percussion recalls Elvis's "Mystery Train" more than Cream's "Sunshine of Your Love," and it adds just the right touch of elegance to an otherwise elementary cut.\n\nPhysical Graffiti only confirms
EXTD=Led Zeppelin's preeminence among hard rockers. Although it contains no startling breakthroughs, it does afford an impressive overview of the band's skill. On "Houses of the Holy," Plant's lyrics mesh perfectly with Page's stuttering licks. Here agai
EXTD=n, the details are half the fun: Bonham kicks the cut along with a cowbell while the two final verses add what sounds like a squeaky chorus of "doit"s behind the vocal - Plant meanwhile is almost inaudibly overdubbed on the song's central chorus, unde
EXTD=rlining the phrase "let the music be your master."\n\nThroughout the album, Page and the band tap a strange lot of sources, although the result is always pure Zeppelin. On "Ten Years Gone," a progression recalling the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" resolve
EXTD=s in a beautifully waddling refrain, Page scooping broad and fuzzy chords behind Plant, who sounds a lot like Rod Stewart. Elsewhere, the band trundles out the Marrakech Symphony Orchestra (for "Kashmir"), Ian Stewart's piano and even a mandolin (bot
EXTD=h for "Boogie with Stu"). Small matter: Jimmy Page could probably arrange a quartet for finger cymbals and have it come lumbering out of the loudspeakers sounding like Led Zeppelin.\n\nNaturally, Graffiti is not without faults -- Zeppelin is too intu
EXTD=itive a band to cut a flawless album. Although Page and Bonham mount a bristling attack on "The Rover," this track, like several others, suffers from Plant's indefinite pitch. Other cuts, such as the ten-minute "Kashmir" and "In My Time of Dying," su
EXTD=ccumb to monotony. "In the Light," one of the album's most ambitious efforts, similarly fizzles down the home stretch, although the problem here is not tedium but a fragmentary composition that never quite jells: When Page on the final release plays 
EXTD=an ascending run intended to sound majestic, the effect is more stilted than stately.\n\nDespite such lapses, Physical Graffiti testifies to Page's taste and Led Zeppelin's versatility. Taken as a whole, it offers an astonishing variety of music, pro
EXTD=duced impeccably by Page. Not that this album will convince the doubters. Anyone with an antipathy to the posturing of Robert Plant or the wooden beat of John Bonham, be forewarned: A Led Zeppelin is a Led Zeppelin is a Led Zeppelin.\n\nPhysical Graf
EXTD=fiti will likely also disappoint those who prefer their rock laced with lyrical significance: Led Zeppelin no more articulates a world view than Little Richard (or Cream) did. Yet while Zeppelin's stature as cultural spokesmen can be questioned, thei
