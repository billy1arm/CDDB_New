EXTT10=I, I said He's born in a manger, He's born low.\nA whole l
EXTT10=ot of people out there boast about where they's born.\nDoes
EXTT10=n't matter where you was born, but just who was born there
EXTT10=\n\nWhen you think about George Washington, the president o

EXTT10=Lincoln\nThe one who we once spoke of as freeing three, fou
EXTT10=r million and a half Negro men.\nAh, it not a matter of whe
EXTT10=re they's born\nBut it was a matter of when they's born and

EXTT10=a poor father and that poor mother\nAnd when I say father,
EXTT10=I have reference to Joseph in this world\nWe know that God
EXTT10=was the Father\nWe know that Mary was His earthly mother\n
EXTT10=We realize that He came through fourteen generations\nAnd b

EXTT10=kept on singing the month that your Savior was born in\n\nB
EXTT10=orn in a manger, wrapped in swaddling cloth\nAnd then when 
EXTT10=I say He's born in a manger then jumped from the\nmanger to
EXTT10=the King of Emmanuel\nAnd come to be King of Kings and Lor
EXTT10=d of all.\n\nRev. J. M. Gates (1884-1945) was by far the mo
EXTT10=st recorded preacher prior to World War II. For many years 
EXTT10=he pastored the Streamline Baptist Church in Atlanta, and h
EXTT10=is stature was no doubt enhanced by his very successful rec
EXTT10=ording career that included more than 200 sermons. He had t

EXTT12=sang on several hit records during the Depression, at first
EXTT12=accompanied by pianist Roosevelt Sykes. By 1935, Davis had
EXTT12=learned to play himself, creating a personal style that wa

EXTT12=ecorded by Elzadie Robinson in 1927 as "The Santa Claus Cra

EXTT13=we get right down to cases. We may claim to deplore the com
EXTT13=mercialization of Christmas, but much of it inevitably is a
EXTT13=bout giving and getting gifts. The versatile Don Redman (19
EXTT13=00-1964) performs here as a saxophonist, arranger, composer
EXTT13=and bandleader. His spoken songs were reminiscent of the g
