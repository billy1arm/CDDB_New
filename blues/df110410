EXTD=The Savoy Brown Collection - Disc 1 of 2\n1993 Deram - Polygram Records, Inc\n\nOriginally Released July 20, 1993\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: With one of the smoothest and most compelling guitarists of the blues-rock style, Savoy Brown and the finger wiza
EXTD=rdry of Kim Simmonds unleashed some of the smoothest and most mesmerizing rock and roll of the 1970s. Their ingenious blend of contented blues and hard-edged rock resulted in some wholesome yet somewhat bypassed guitar music. The Savoy Brown Collectio
EXTD=n is a two-disc compilation that takes their best tunes from 14 different albums and presents the listener with a sufficient amount of material that never becomes tiresome. Some of the meatier material comes from 1971's Street Corner Talking, like t
EXTD=he ultra-smooth "I Can't Get Next to You" and Willie Dixon's "Wang Dang Doodle." Equally impressive is the haunting "Poor Girl" or the desperate guitar cry of "Leavin' Again," both from the sensational Looking In album. The real treasures are the lo
EXTD=ne tunes taken from some of their lesser-known albums. "I'm Tired," from A Step Further, emanates pathos through instrumentation, while "Stranger Blues" is a startling example of prime guitar manipulation. Early material from albums like Shake Down 
EXTD=and Blue Matter have former lead singer Chris Youlden at the helm, who departed before the Looking In album, replaced by Lonesome Dave Peverett who later formed Foghat. Overshadowed by bands like the Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin, Savoy Brown didn't ge

EXTD=0s when nearly every aspiring rock band felt they had to learn to play the blues. A few of them, like Savoy Brown, actually became decent blues bands. But rather than thinking of Savoy Brown in the strict blues vein, I see them for where they took t
EXTD=heir own music. These guys played live with big energy and they had an infectuous boogie groove. In that respect, they did play an important role in rock during their peak. I think that one reason they didn't maintain their popularity is because the
EXTD=y didn't change much over time and since the music world was morphing rapidly, they kinda got left behind. But that doesn't take away from the great music they made. \n\nI went a little low on the rating for a couple of reasons. First, if there were
EXTD=half stars available, I wouldn't hesitate to bump this up to 3.5 stars, but can't manage to go to 4. The reason I'm hesitant to go up to 4 is that I feel these tunes hold up better in their original LP than in a compilation. So I'd put 4 stars on S
EXTD=treet Corner Talking and Looking In without hesitation. Maybe it's because of all the times we sat around (or danced around) at parties when the whole LP was played. Secondly, I find some of these tunes a bit weak and I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings 
EXTD=for albums that are more consistently strong.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe Savoy Brown Collection sans Vicksburg Blues?, June 30, 2004\nReviewer: Brian McRae (Oakland,Calif]\nThis collection is good! Before the group degenerated into Foghat,th
EXTD=ey pretty much answered the question: "Can white men sing(and play) the blues ?" I believe Chris Youlden's version of "Vicksburg Blues" is the best evidence of this . I consider it a gross oversight to have excluded this song from this collection.Al
EXTD=so the live version of their boogie tribute in which the name of the city of Detroit is mentioned is also missing. Yes, I am aware it is hard to please everyone . Perhaps the record company should have polled the listeners and fans of one of the gre
EXTD=atest blues groups to come out of the United Kingdom. Now with the current technology it is possible for myself and others to correct this by burning a cd or downloading an ipod. Only for personal use of course. I am happy that "Hellbound Train,Tell
EXTD=Mama,Louisana,Needle and Spoon,Stay While the Night is Young,and Train to Nowhere" are on the collection. I hope one of the instrumental song's whose title I can't recall is on this collection . What i remember about this song are the great guitar 
EXTD=solo and a surprise violin string section which added quite a dramatic flair to this song. I strongly suggest that people purchase this collection to see what music was like B.C.C. (before corporate control) and for the pure enjoyment of listening t

EXTD=e taken from SB's three greatest albums: Raw Sienna, Looking In, and Street Corner Talking. Also, only one cut apiece was drawn from such "lesser" works as Boogie Brothers, Jack the Toad, Wire Fire, Skin 'N Bone, and Savage Return, and this was prob
EXTD=ably a wise decision as well. Personally, it's regrettable that only two tracks should be drawn from such an excellent set as Getting to the Point - how about including "Walking By Myself", "Big City Lights", or "Taste and Try Before You Buy?" (Now t
EXTD=hat we're on the subject: What about a second collection chronicling the years 1981 to the present? True, SB's glory days were in the sixities and early seventies, but there is enough good material on their later releases to warrant a new compilatio
EXTD=n.) In any case, the listener will be blown away by the range and depth of this material, from traditional blues covers ("I Ain't Superstitious", "Louisiana Blues") to startling new originals ("Mr. Downchild", "Money Cant Save Your Soul") - from rabb
EXTD=le-rousing party anthems ("Tell Mama", "I'm Tired") to lengthy but never tedious jams ("Leaving Again", "Hellbound Train"), this band could do it all. Thanks for such a long history of great music must go to the fantastic musicians that helped make

EXTD=album after album, concert after concert. Last but not least, the listener should thank Kim Simmonds, SB's founder, leader, and guiding force, for having the courage to reinvent himself and to insist on only the highest standards for himself and his

EXTD=avoy Brown, June 12, 2003\nReviewer: A music fan\nNothing will ever replaced seeing these guys live in some small club - but this is close. One of the all time great and unique blues groups and I can still see them nailing the drums to the stage bef

EXTD=arterville, Illinois United States)          \nThis 2 cd anthology compiles Decca material from the years 1967-1978 (14 lps some of which are not in print at present). Savoy Brown was/is the blues/rock boogie band of Kim Simmonds the lead guitarist/
EXTD=part time singer and only original member still in the band. The band's early work is similar to a number of British blues/rock bands from this era such as Ten Years After, early Fleetwood Mac, and Stan Webb's Chicken Shack among others. The band is
EXTD=often unfairly overlooked due to Simmond's band member turnover and the decline in the later period material. The earlier material (highlighted on the first disk) consisted of blues covers, blues based originals, boogie numbers, and jazzier numbers
EXTD=Later the band became more commercial and less successful. This period is highlighted rather effectively on the second disk. In my opinion the peak period of the band was during the years 1968-70 when Chris Youlden handled the vocals and part of t
EXTD=he songwriting. The bands membership is ever changing and notable ex-members include Lonesome Dave Peveritt, Tone Stevens, and Roger Earle who would quit to form another British boogie/blues band Foghat. Another notable ex-member is keyboard player/
EXTD=guitarist Paul Raymond (formerly of Chicken Shack, Webb's whole backing band joined Simmonds after Foghat was formed)who was later a member of UFO, and the Michael Schenker Group. Bassist Andy Pyle was in Blodwyn Pig and later Wishbone Ash. This com
EXTD=pilation is representative of all the band's line-ups through 1978. An emphasis is placed on the stronger material up to 1974. Perhaps the biggest surprise with this collection is the versatility of Kim Simmond's guitar playing. He is equally at hom
EXTD=e with a boogie rave-up like the cover of Muddy Water's "Louisiana Blues" as he is with the more fluid jazzier runs on the material included from the "Raw Sienna" lp (my favorite). Some of my favorite tunes include "Train To Nowhere", "I'm Tired" (l
EXTD=ater covered by Little Milton), and later material like Howlin' Wolf's "Wang Dang Doodle" and "Hellbound Train" with Dave Walker on vocals. Walker would subsequently leave to join Fleetwood Mac. I would have included a few cuts like their covers of 
EXTD="Walking By Myself", "You Need Love", "Grits Ain't Groceries", "Howling For My Darling", "I Hate To See You Go" and their own tunes like "A Little More Wine", and "Looking In" among others. However, this is far and away the best sampling of Savoy Br
EXTD=own if you are on a budget and can't afford to pick up all their cds. If you like British blues/rock this is a must. I recommend the "Raw Sienna" and "Looking In" cds to those who want more Savoy Brown after enjoying this fine compilation.\n\nAMAZON
EXTD=COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nKim Simmonds Can Play the Blues, September 2, 2001\nReviewer: Lewis Rose (North Potomac, MD United States]\nI can remember the first time I heard Savoy Brown. A high school friend fired up Tell Mama and I was hooked. But it was
EXTD=not until I heard A Hard Way To Go, Stay While The Night is Young, Street Corner Talking, Hellbound Train, and Wang Dang Doodle that I realized how excellent Savoy Brown was. Those songs still resonate throughout me like great music has a tendency 
EXTD=to do. This collection has all the tunes and then some. It is an essential CD for any fan of British blues. And Seth, if you read this, drop me an email. I want to thank you for turning me on to Savoy Brown.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNo filler!
EXTD=, April 20, 2000\nReviewer: D. Hartley (Seattle, WA USA]\nThe trouble I have with most "anthology" box sets is that they are either a.)glorified "greatest hits" packages with several of those dreaded "newly recorded" tracks tossed in to pad things o

EXTD=e great British blues guitarists who started out around the same time (Clapton, Beck, Page and Co.),Savoy Brown's Kim Simmonds has quietly remained the most faithful to an authentic blues sound. Considering the revolving door of band personnel who are
EXTD=represented here, what impresses the listener is how consistently Simmonds has kept to his original vision over the years, without ever becoming boring or sounding stale. If you're only budgeted for one purchase for your Savoy Brown collection, you
