EXTD=EW: Hi Times: Hi Records R&B Years is a superb three-disc box set
EXTD=covering all of the label's greatest hits, plus a number of forg
EXTD=otten gems. Al Green understandably dominates the set, since he n
EXTD=ot only was Hi's biggest artist, he also defined the label's soun
EXTD=d with producer Willie Mitchell. As a result, the music on these 
EXTD=three discs can sound a little similar at times, but the songwrit
EXTD=ing and performances from the likes of Green, Ann Peebles, and Jo
EXTD=e Clay is first-rate, making Hi Times a necessary addition to any
EXTD=serious soul collection. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAmazon.co

EXTD=l Green's commercial flowering in the '70s. Hi Times opens with a
EXTD=1959 track from old Elvis sideman Bill Black and ends with a 197
EXTD=7 recording from Green's The Belle Album, which pretty much signa
