EXTD=Originally Released 1983\nCD Edition Released ??\nRemastered CD Edition Released August 5, 2003\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Despite the fact that Seven and the Ragged Tiger couldn't match the unrestrained pop/rock ebullience of 1982's Rio, Duran Duran put 
EXTD=three of the album's singles in the Top Ten, taking it to number one in the U.K. Even though "The Reflex" gave the band their first number one hit, there's an overabundance of fancy glitz and dancefloor flamboyancy running through it, unlike "New Moo
EXTD=n on Monday"'s straight-ahead appeal or "Union of the Snake"'s mysterious, almost taboo flair. It's apparent that Seven and the Ragged Tiger's content has the band moving ever so slightly into a danceclub arena, with the songs leaning more toward the
EXTD=ir ability to produce a sexier sound through electronics and instrumentation than through a firm lyrical and musical partnership. Even the unreleased tracks trade Duran Duran's handsome edginess for a shinier sound, heard mainly on "I Take the Dice" 
EXTD=and "Cracks in the Pavement." It's here that Lebon and Taylor's personalities begins to get overshadowed by the demand to produce a more synth-snazzy and fashionable style of music. Although they may have turned their songwriting down a notch in orde

EXTD=with the band's best work, and there is no better insight into lyricist Simon LeBon's fascinating inner life. The enigmatic title is a multi-faceted reference to the two Berrow brothers who guided the quintet (2 and 5 =7) early on, the seven 'chakras'

EXTD=hat only recall "Hungry Like the Wolf" and all the countless songs Duran Duran had on the radio, one can easily forget how different, unique and innovative a band like Duran really was in the early 1980s. Duran Duran were no doubt the first "new roma

EXTD=The third album by Duran Duran showcases a different and more pop/dance-oriented sound the band was experimenting with at the time. Elements of early Duran Duran, the dark, brooding and eerie "new romantic" sound they mastered on their first album an
EXTD=d again on RIO, are less noticeable here. Perhaps only "The Seventh Stranger", a stand-out track on its own, reaches back for the classic, darker Duran sound. What is here is the masterful pop/dance rock music with elements like abstract lyrics (perh
EXTD=aps best personified in "New Moon on Monday") and night club taboo grooves (of which "Union of the Snake" screams). And then there is "The Reflex", which combines both elements to a flashy and climactic finish.\n\nThe underlying story of this album i
EXTD=s that Duran lost a bit of its edginess as they struggled to maintain their original sound while trying to capture the glossiness that was friendly on radio at the time. (A struggle that eventually broke the original lineup apart in 1986.) However, t
EXTD=he relevance of the Duran sound has been vindicated by the current rush of today's top acts to say Duran Duran was an influence. And in many respects, the songs on this album sound better today than they did in 1983. Even though the album was a huge 
EXTD=seller and spawned three top 10 hits, it's a little uneven. But when they deliver, they put forth some of the best material of their original run, like the engaging instrumental "Tiger Tiger" and the masterful pop of "(I'm Looking For) Cracks in the 
EXTD=Pavement" and the highly underrated "Shadows on Your Side".\n\nSome often forget Duran Duran was indeed a talented and instrumentally gifted outfit. The rhythm section of Roger Taylor (drums) and John Taylor (bass) are at long last getting their dues
EXTD=for the true talent they possess. Andy Taylor is an underrated guitarist who shines with both his delicate, atmospheric tones and what quickly became more urgent and rocking sounds, and Nick Rhodes does just the same thing, only with keyboards. Fina
EXTD=lly, Simon LeBon is perhaps the most brash and over the top front man since Mick Jagger, and that fit perfectly into the Duran style here, as by the time this album was released Duran were the kings of MTV.\n\nMany of the songs on SEVEN AND THE RAGGE
EXTD=D TIGER remain highlights in a live Duran Duran concert setting in 2005. You like The Killers? You like the rush of "new wave" influenced music currently underway? This album, as well as "Duran Duran" (their debut album), "Astronaut" (their excellent
EXTD=2004 comeback album), "The Singles 81-85" and "Rio" showcase the originators of the sound, of which there are many imitators (still today) but only one original.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nBig Dud, July 20, 2004\nReviewer: Dave Bara "db" (Auburn
EXTD=, WA United States) \nThe Third Album was supposed to be the triumphal, world-conquering follow-up to "Rio". Instead it comes across as over-produced smarmy pop with an overblown title and bad cover art to boot. This is the one D2 album I hardly ever

EXTD=inanity. "Cracks in the Pavement" and "I take the Dice" are pure pablum filler. Side one grinds to a close with "Of Crime And Passion", a song trying so hard to be edgy it ultimately spins off the 'ol turntable. "Union of the Snake" is solid chart m

EXTD=and Andy Taylor's guitar solo theme work is gorgeous. The album ends abruptly, far short of it's intended goal. This album needs a serious "Director's Cut" style updating from Nick and Simon to bring it back to respectability. If they had included th
