EXTD=n of Brian Wilson and Co.'s early work (the first 16 singles, to be
EXTD=exact) by repackaging it in the original 45 sleeve art. The musi

EXTD=CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA treat for the elite., June 10, 2008 \nBy  Jose
EXTD=ph M. Davis (Boston, MA USA]\n\nA lot of fun for the serious fan 
EXTD=of Brian Wilson and his band. This collection is worth the price 
EXTD=to hear "She Knows Me Too Well" in stereo. Nicely packaged. If yo
EXTD=u do not have California Girls and Please Let Me Wonder in stereo
EXTD=these are included here as well. When I first saw this I thought
EXTD=it was a gimmick that I didn't need until I realized that there 
EXTD=were new stereo mixes involved. If only it could include a full s
EXTD=tereo mix of I Get Around and for the next set Good Vibrations. B
EXTD=ut if you want to see how the band emerged singles-wise, this is 
EXTD=pretty cool. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe Record Compani

EXTD=ant. They can't go on anymore putting out disposable (c)rap music
EXTD=and expect to compete with the web or direct artist-to-audience 
EXTD=business models. Anyway, this marvelous set is a visual, musical,
EXTD=and audio delight. I don't know if the material has been remaste

EXTD=? Yes, of course much of it has been released many times over, as
EXTD=another reviewer noted, BUT HOW MANY BEACH BOYS NEWCOMERS ARE EX
EXTD=PECTED TO BUY THIS SET ANYWAY? THIS IS A NICHE PRODUCT AIMED AT T
EXTD=HE MORE-THAN-CASUAL FAN, although (as is true with BB music gener
EXTD=ally), casual fans will certainly enjoy the music. And there are 
EXTD=some nuggets that are (at least for me), new finds. I.E. the live
EXTD=version of "409" on the first disc is not one that I've heard be
EXTD=fore and crackles with energy (as do many live BB recordings from
EXTD=their first surge of popularity). The tactile and visual qualiti
EXTD=es of this set are also wonderful -- the colors and varying textu
EXTD=res of the box, as well as the reproduction 45 sleeves inside and
EXTD=the hardcover, "sand covered" book convey the optimism and happi
EXTD=ness of a better time. Highly recommended. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTO
EXTD=MER REVIEW\nshe doesn't know me so well, September 11, 2008 \nBy 
EXTD=J. Brown (Manahawkin, NJ]\n\nAm I the only one who noticed that 
EXTD=the stereo mix of she knows me so well is missing the guitar and 
EXTD=doubled vocal tracks? Someone really missed the boat here. If tho
EXTD=se elements are missing, then it should be mentioned somewhere as
EXTD=it is in Pet Sounds. Also, the remixes are not faithful to the e
EXTD=q. of the mono mixes. I shouldn't complain, but if you're going 
EXTD=to do it, Capitol, do it right. \n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIE

EXTD=s Singles box set if for you. I've struggled a long time to assem
EXTD=ble my own set of the mono Beach Boys singles and it's not easy. 
EXTD=This set makes it all perfect. The original mono mixes for the si

EXTD=REVIEW\nAs Close to Time Travel as We Are Now Capable . . ., Jul
EXTD=y 18, 2008 \nBy  Edwin W. Skinner, Jr. "kindofblue" (Rocky Mount,
EXTD=NC]\n\nThe merits of this set as laid out in strictly musical te
EXTD=rms already have been discussed. This is essential pop music and 
EXTD=would be an awesome addition to any collection. Beautiful package
EXTD=, cool book and the sounds . . . well, let's just say that they a
EXTD=re as fresh and innovative today as they were way back when. \n\n
EXTD=For many of us, however, this set is much more than the temporal 
EXTD=sounds that emanate from the tiny, round aluminum circles contain
EXTD=ed herein. Within this box is the sound of a different America an
EXTD=d a different world - a sound from a time that saw everything as a
EXTD=possibility, and the future as some sure-to-be-terrific adventur
EXTD=e. The Beach Boys represent this time, this America, maybe better
EXTD=than any band in the history of popular music. With 40-odd years
EXTD=of hindsight, however, we now see how much both America and the 
EXTD=Beach Boys have changed - and lost. Never a band to hide its (sad
EXTD=) emotions, the poignancy this reverse view of time elicits is st
EXTD=aggering when you hear the music literally jump out of this box a
EXTD=nd into your ears. Packaged as updated 45 singles, the set furthe
EXTD=r removes the listener to a more innocent time - a time before alb
EXTD=ums were 40-minute statements and taken as whole works of art. On
EXTD=ce upon a time the Song was the Thing, and the Beach Boys ruled t
EXTD=hat very magical universe. \n\nThe Beach Boys traveled many diffc
EXTD=ult roads during the years that followed their heydey as chronicl
EXTD=ed in this collection. Brian went nuts. Dennis lost the fight of 
EXTD=his life, succumbing to the evils of excess. Carl lost to an even
EXTD=more insidious enemy, as cancer removed his angelic voice from t
EXTD=his world and carried it to its most logical venue. Thankfully, t
EXTD=hen, we have this music to remind us just how talent, heart, desi
EXTD=re and true love of craft can translate into the finest canon of 
EXTD=popular music ever committed to tape. I say this with no apologie
EXTD=s to the Beatles, the Stones - or anyone else. \n\nSo, the Beach 
EXTD=Boys (despite both Mike Love's and Al Jardine's most pathetic attem
EXTD=pts) are no more. And neither is America - at least not the one w
EXTD=e once knew, or the one we once dreamed of. Buy this box, load yo
EXTD=ur multi-disc tray and shut your eyes, however, and you are quick
EXTD=ly transferred - if only temporarily - to a time when for both th
EXTD=e Beach Boys and America, anything was possible. \n\nPresumably -
EXTD=and hopefully - there will be a second collection of Beach Boys 
EXTD=singles, none of which will be as celebrated as the songs contain
EXTD=ed in this set. Nevertheless, some great songs followed, and many
EXTD=of them had very little to do with the Genius of Brian Wilson. W
EXTD=hen/if that set appears, we can then discuss its merits as the so
EXTD=undtrack to the Downfall of America, the End of Innocence and the
EXTD=withering-on-the-vine of America's most important and influentia
EXTD=l band. \n\n-- Comments Regarding the Above Post --\nInitial post

EXTD=ween the fall of the Beach Boys and the decline of America -- the
EXTD=two did seem to parallel each other. Of course it could just be 
EXTD=the cycle of the self-centered baby boomer world view -- everythi
EXTD=ng seemed possible in the 60s, then they got older and whined and
EXTD=complained, now everything stinks and it's all gone to heck, and
EXTD=the summer peaches don't taste like they used to.\n\nBut given t
EXTD=hat the baby boomers were and are, by their sheer numbers, an una
EXTD=voidable majority -- perhaps we're all in for the ride. Yippee.\n
EXTD=\nAmerica has suffered greatly at the hands of these people. They
EXTD=promised everything and demanded the world change, demaned every
EXTD=one follow them. And while things did indeed change--it wasn't en
EXTD=ough for them--it was never quick enough, and no one ever cared t
EXTD=o examine the outcomes. And pills did things so much quicker anyw

EXTD=long. Ritalin for everyone!\n\nNever the ones to buckle down, pul
EXTD=l themselves up and get things done the old fashion way -- we're 
EXTD=now "blessed" with rotting inner-cities and a generation of degen
EXTD=erate politicians, promising to do everything for us -- but the o
EXTD=nly outcomes are really just higher taxes and impossible services
EXTD=that can never be rendered (and never intended to be) by a rulin
EXTD=g elite. So, it's the baby boomer kids, grand-kids and great-gran
EXTD=d kids who get stuck with the MASSIVE bill, while the degenerate 
EXTD=baby boomer "grand" parents -- having already left the table -- a
EXTD=re off dancing in tie-dyed t-shirts reliving woodstock. They were
EXTD=supposed to leave the tip, but they forgot. Again.\n\nThe Beach 
EXTD=Boys, and the wonderful music contained herein, does capture the 
EXTD=innocence and promise of America before it was weighted down by t
EXTD=he bilge of glossy-eyed Marxism and a radical anti-American citiz
EXTD=enry mascarading as doves, that STILL prefers to "shock us" at ev
EXTD=ery turn and--to this day--enjoys aiming their guns and spite at 
EXTD=its own people, while physically disarming them at that! But, it'
EXTD=s a much different world today than it was in 1962, that's for su
EXTD=re.\n\nThe Beach Boys were along for the ride, too. Brian Wilson 
EXTD=probably just as much a victim of all this as anybody. A young, s
EXTD=omewhat naive kid who had a lot of doubt and fears. As fame and f
EXTD=ortune struck him, he dove into the "hip" counter-culture of the 
EXTD=mid-60s to find and be accepted. While the promise of enlightenme
EXTD=nt yielded amazing results at first in his brilliant, musical min
EXTD=d, it quickly unraveled, leaving a shattered shell of a man behin
EXTD=d.\n\nBut you get none of that shattered soul here. This is Brian
EXTD=and his brothers in sunny Southern California, living a dream...
EXTD=just as it was supposed to be. Girls, cars, school and girls. You

EXTD=nding Armageddon and how the teens riding around in their hybrid 
EXTD=mystery van, with their messy hair and earth-toned clothing, are 
EXTD=going to save the planet for future generations. Wow.\n\nAs for t
EXTD=he box set itself, I suspect you could have gotten a better produ

EXTD=vers, front and back, full-size, in a nice full color book (perha

EXTD=EVIEW\nEnough already!, July 4, 2008 \nBy  John Benevento\n\nIt's
EXTD=absolutely disgraceful how Capitol treats its Beach Boys fans re
EXTD=garding the release of their stereo mixes. Every few years we hav

EXTD=wthorne,CA" (Heroes and Villains, Dance Dance Dance), in 1998 it 
EXTD=was "Endless Harmony" (California Girls), in 1996 it was "Pet Sou

EXTD=t: $132.98 for two new stereo mixes (When I Grow Up To Be A Man a
EXTD=nd She Knows Me Too Well). At this rate the stereo Good Vibration
EXTD=s will cost $10,000 in 2025!! There's no reason (other than greed
EXTD=) why they couldn't have included "I Get Around" and "Help Me Rho
EXTD=nda" in stereo here as well. Bootlegs of these recordings exist w
EXTD=ith just one or two overdubs missing. There are many good homemad
