EXTD=T REVIEW:  Of all the early rock and rollers, Fats Domino was the e
EXTD=asiest to take for granted, since he made it all seem so easy. Ev
EXTD=en when it rocked hard, his music was so relaxed, so friendly tha
EXTD=t it sounded effortless and natural, which was part of the reason
EXTD=that his classic recordings for Imperial in the '50s were so con
EXTD=sistently enjoyable. All the hits, many of their flips sides, and
EXTD=most of his album cuts were flat-out fun -- maybe not as revolut
EXTD=ionary as work by Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and t
EXTD=he Everly Brothers, but his body of work for Imperial not only st
EXTD=ands proudly next to theirs, but is just as influential. This muc
EXTD=h is clear after years of hindsight, but in the late '60s he was 
EXTD=as passé as any of his peers, even if there were legions of new r
EXTD=ockers, from the Beatles to Randy Newman, who were raised on his 
EXTD=music. It may have been only seven years since Fats had seven Top
EXTD=40 singles in 1961, but when 1968 rolled around in the wake of t
EXTD=he British Invasion, psychedelia, Swinging London, and the Summer
EXTD=of Love, it felt like a lifetime. Domino may have been out of st
EXTD=ep with the times, having struggled through a rough stint at ABC 
EXTD=during the mid-'60s, but the pendulum had started to swing back t
EXTD=oward straight-ahead rock and roll -- that year, the Rolling Stones
EXTD=shrugged off psychedelia with Beggars Banquet, the Band kicked o
EXTD=ff Americana with their debut, Music From Big Pink, and the Beatl
EXTD=es started rocking again with Paul McCartney's Chuck Berry tribut
EXTD=e "Back in the U.S.S.R." and his Fats homage "Lady Madonna." Perh
EXTD=aps picking up on this shift in tastes, Reprise Records chairman 
EXTD=Mo Ostin, under the urging of staff producer Richard Perry, signe
EXTD=d Domino for a comeback record that year. Perry helmed Fats Is Ba
EXTD=ck, a splashy update of Domino's classic sound that sounds halfwa
EXTD=y between a Vegas review and the silver screen. Domino chose not 
EXTD=to play piano on the album, so Perry drafted in fellow New Orlean
EXTD=s pianist James Booker along with Fats disciple Randy Newman to p
EXTD=lay, and the results are close to Fats himself -- they may not ro
EXTD=ll quite as easy and they certainly are slicker, but the songs ar
EXTD=e strong (particularly Booker's "So Swell When You're Well" and a
EXTD=take on Barbara George's "I Know") and the music is a successful
EXTD=retooling of his classic sound, and when married to the spirited
EXTD=vocal performance from Fats, it's a thoroughly enjoyable album.\n
EXTD=\nUnfortunately, Fats Is Back was not a successful album. Despite
EXTD=a high-profile single cover of "Lady Madonna" and a positive rev
EXTD=iew from Jan Wenner in Rolling Stone, the album barely made any i
EXTD=mpact, and neither did the two singles that followed it. His fina
EXTD=l album for Reprise, simply entitled Fats, was comprised entirely
EXTD=of Dave Bartholomew-produced sessions from the late '60s and rel
EXTD=eased only in the U.K. and Europe in 1971, never seeing proper re
EXTD=lease in the U.S. With that, Fats Domino's late-'60s comeback was
EXTD=over nearly as quickly as it began, and he never attempted any l
EXTD=arge-scale return to recording again. While these recordings may 
EXTD=not have garnered much attention at the time, Rhino Handmade's si
EXTD=ngle-disc 2005 release Sweet Patootie: The Complete Reprise Recor
EXTD=dings proves that they were as reliably entertaining as most of F
EXTD=ats' other recordings from the '50s and '60s. At the very least, 
EXTD=the Perry productions were a considerable improvement over the st
EXTD=ilted ABC sides, which felt syrupy and directionless. Perry's wor
EXTD=k may have been glossy, but it rang true to the spirit of the Imp
EXTD=erial recordings, and by de-emphasizing Domino's piano, it illust
EXTD=rated what a fine, versatile vocalist Fats was, and in his non-LP
EXTD=version of Newman's "Have You Seen My Baby?," Fats turned in his
EXTD=greatest latter-day performance. In contrast to the snazzy Perry
EXTD=productions, the music that made the Fats album is a little lazy
EXTD=Instead of providing creative sparks, reuniting with Bartholome
EXTD=w let Domino relax just a little bit too much. He may have writte
EXTD=n the majority of the material here, often with Bartholomew, but 
EXTD=the music rolls just a little bit too easy, with the piano buried
EXTD=even further in the mix here than it was on Fats Is Back. That s
EXTD=aid, Fats still was an enjoyable record -- the songs may have not
EXTD=been remarkable, but they're well written and fun -- and it's ce
EXTD=rtainly a pleasant, respectable latter-day record from a giant of
EXTD=rock and roll. As a stand-alone record, it may have not amounted t
EXTD=o much in the early '70s, but as the concluding portion of Sweet 
EXTD=Patootie, it simply confirms that while Domino may have not been 
EXTD=with the psychedelicized times of the late '60s, he still turned 
EXTD=out good music -- music that may be better appreciated now, when 
EXTD=placed in context of both the '60s and Fats' career, than it was 
EXTD=then.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW

EXTD=not much "traditional"-Imperial label type rockin' R and B by Fats

EXTD=rant a high placement on your CD carousel. He made the R and R Hall

EXTD=ain much rationale for that achievement.\n\nAlthough FD has staye
EXTD=d with his '50s material on stage, in the studio he's consistentl
EXTD=y tried new things - in the late '50s when he did a version of "M

EXTD=he got together with Dave Bartholomew and Richard Perry for somet
EXTD=hing different.\n\nThe Bartholomew productions appear to have bee
EXTD=n cut for the Broadmoor label which gave us two singles for said 
EXTD=label and the remaining sides unissued until '71 on Reprise. "I'm
EXTD=Going To Cross That River" is contemporary uptempo, not followin
EXTD=g a blues progression - the bass line and horns are sophisticated 
EXTD=for the time. However, the mix pushes back the piano and drums to
EXTD=the extent that one wonders if only *one* channel was working du
EXTD=ring the mastering. "I'm Going To Help A Friend" is another unusu
EXTD=al and pleasant sound - a very light production, it sounds as if 
EXTD=it was recorded at home for purposes of a demo tape. "These Old S
EXTD=hoes" has a James Brown sound, one chord [musicians correct me if
EXTD=I'm wrong] with horns reminiscent of those heard on JB's "It Won
EXTD='t Be Me". "Wait Till It Happens To You, No. 2" [though issued fi
EXTD=rst] could have been a hit B-side for Antoine D. back in the Impe
EXTD=rial days and it works here in the '60s as a notable blues ballad
EXTD=with just the right Crescent City seasoning. "Another Mule" is b
EXTD=lues-jazz, nicely done. FD fans check out two other versions: ent
EXTD=itled "Man, That's All" done earlier for ABC Paramount, and as "A
EXTD=nother Mule" on the Tomato label around 1990. "Work My Way Up Ste
EXTD=ady" is a fine Ivory Joe Hunter composition, another up-to-date m
EXTD=edium rocker. This one has a hint of Motown. Too bad we have a sl
EXTD=ightly cloudy mix here - collectors look for the Broadmoor single
EXTD=Despite all these successful experiments, it just might be the 
EXTD=very familiar "Lawdy, Miss Clawdy" which lifts the listener. Ofco
EXTD=urse the historians will enjoy hearing Fats do his own rendition 
EXTD=of a classic which included his piano back in '52.\n\nA much more
EXTD=polished (and commercial) set was done by Mr. Perry and ofcourse
EXTD=fans should know the highlights of "Fats Is Back" by now: "Make 
EXTD=Me Belong To You", "Honest Papas Love Their Mamas Better", "One F
EXTD=or The Highway" are some of his best efforts, period. Yes, it see
EXTD=ms as if the producer was a bit obssessed with "Sgt. Pepper", "Pe
EXTD=nny Lane", and the rest and on the original l.p. issue we got *tw
EXTD=o* Beatles covers done in *Beatles* style to take up alot of spac
EXTD=e on the album. "Everybody's Got Something To Hide..." was a pret
EXTD=ty groovy 45rpm, though, and here it makes its' CD debut on Track
EXTD=#12. But these slight indulgences shouldn't diminish an altogeth
EXTD=er artistic success.\n\nThere are two previously unreleased c. '7
EXTD=0 numbers added to this limited edition CD which certainly enhanc
EXTD=e the value - the "cerebral" "Can't Chase A Dream Forever" and "B
EXTD=lues So Bad" are beautifully recorded tunes which should have fou
EXTD=nd an album spot way back when.\n\nThe sub-title tune for this se
EXTD=t is yet another non-traditional effort which should delight the 
EXTD=fans.\n\nI'm a little disappointed by the reissue artwork - the c
EXTD=over appears to be a copy of the '68 "Fats Is Back" cover, and th
EXTD=e reverse a crop of the ultra-rare "Fats" cover. I would have enj
EXTD=oyed seeing reproductions of both original front and back covers,
EXTD=front and back on this package. Also, the missing session detail
EXTD=s might cause a few frowns. Naturally we assume these notes were 
EXTD=unavailable at press time - and we thank Rhino Handmade for a grea

EXTD=!, February 14, 2005\nBy Robert Eaglesham (Leeds, UK]\n\nI eagerl
EXTD=y awaited this compilation's release because it contains some har
EXTD=d-to-find Fats rarities.\n\nTracks 1 to 11 are taken in order fro
EXTD=m the excellent "Fats is Back" album from 1968, an underrated gem
EXTD=in the Fats discography. The Richard Perry-produced album at tim
EXTD=es verges on being over-produced but escapes the sickly sweet, st
EXTD=ring-laden excesses of his ABC period in the early 60's. All the 
EXTD="Back" tracks boast a driving rhythm section, cracking horns and 
EXTD=the Fat Man on the best vocal form of his career. Tracks 12 and 1
EXTD=3, also Richard Perry productions, are in the same vein. Have You
EXTD=Seen My Baby, a Randy Newman composition, is particularly strong
EXTD=and, unable to find it elsewhere, made the whole cd worth buying
EXTD=for me as a Fats die-hard.\n\nTracks 14 onwards come from Fats' 
EXTD=mid-late 60's efforts with long-time co-writer and producer, Dave
EXTD=Bartholomew. Sadly, the spark, found in all their classic Imperi
EXTD=al hits of Fats' 50's heyday, fails to re-ignite here. The tunes 
EXTD=themselves are average, the arrangements are lazy and the product
EXTD=ion sounds very thin, especially after listening to the first hal
EXTD=f of this cd. Only Lawdy Miss Clawdy and Work My Way Up Steady of
EXTD=fer glimpses of the old magic. Another Mule is interesting but I 
EXTD=prefer the earlier version Fats did at ABC.\n\nAll in all, casual
EXTD=fans, if looking to buy something beyond a greatest hits compila
EXTD=tion, would do much better to just buy "Fats is Back", also avail
