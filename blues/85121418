EXTD=any\n\nOriginally Released February 16, 1999\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW
EXTD=:  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Springfield had an unusual 
EXTD=arrangement whereby Philips released her records everywhere in th
EXTD=e world except the United States, where they appeared on Atlantic
EXTD=Atlantic chose to release only 1968-71 material that was record
EXTD=ed in the U.S., meaning that quite a few tracks she recorded in B
EXTD=ritain during this time went unreleased stateside. This collects 
EXTD=24 of those songs Springfield recorded in the U.K. between 1968 a
EXTD=nd 1971, only a few which had appeared in the U.S. before. Althou
EXTD=gh this is not as soul- and R&B-oriented as the material Atlantic
EXTD=recorded with her in America during this era, in truth it's not 
EXTD=always that far removed in sound and spirit from what you'll hear
EXTD=on the Atlantic albums Dusty in Memphis (1969) and A Brand New M
EXTD=e (1970). You can't get much more soulful than "Piece of My Heart
EXTD=," for instance, a good cover of which leads off the collection. 
EXTD=Overall, though, it takes in a broader range of pop styles than S
EXTD=pringfield did with her American/Atlantic recordings, from covers
EXTD=of the Rascals ("How Can I Be Sure") and Goffin-King ("Wasn't Bo
EXTD=rn to Follow") to Charles Aznavour, Leon Russell, Jimmy Webb, Bac
EXTD=harach-David, and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Most of it's taken from t
EXTD=he British albums Dusty Definitely (1968) and See All Her Faces (
EXTD=1972), and it's lower on standout performances than the familiar 
EXTD=Atlantic albums are. The singing is almost always involved and co
EXTD=mmitted, but sometimes the material is pedestrian. The highlights
EXTD=are very good, however, including Randy Newman's "I Think It's G
EXTD=oing to Rain Today," the beautiful string ballad "Morning," and t
EXTD=he bossa nova spiced "See All Her Faces." This is worth hearing i
EXTD=f you like Springfield a lot - just don't gear up for an extraordi
EXTD=narily consistent or essential listen.  -- Richie Unterberger\n\n
EXTD=\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nDespite the Dusty in Memphis-looka
EXTD=like packaging, this is actually not a unified album, rather a ne
EXTD=w collection of old stuff, recorded between 1968 and 1971 but nev
EXTD=er released in America until now. Springfield had outgrown the in
EXTD=nocence of her girl-group-style material, and she was trying to f
EXTD=ind a path between her heavily orchestrated British hits and the 
EXTD=earthier sound--and more adventurous songwriting--she'd taken on 
EXTD=with Memphis, and she stretches out in all directions here. There
EXTD=are more than a few syrupy overarrangements, but also some fabul
EXTD=oums experiments, including covers of Rascals and Leon Russell so
EXTD=ngs that let her sensitivity to lyrics shine, and a harrowing, un
EXTD=certain take on "Piece of My Heart." --Douglas Wolk \n\n\nHalf.co

EXTD=est of the world, while Dusty Springfield was signed to Atlantic

EXTD=unissued-in-the-U.S. Philips material from 1968-1971.\n\n"Piece 
EXTD=of My Heart" shows Janis up, "How Can I Be Sure" outpaces the Ras
EXTD=cals for cool atmosphere, and the two Bacharach/David tunes are t
EXTD=ypically magnificent, as are the surprising pair of Brazilian-pop
EXTD=tracks by Gilberto Gil and Antonio Carlos Jobim. The masterpiece
EXTD=is Dusty's heartbreaking rendition of Randy Newman's bleak "I Th
EXTD=ink It's Going to Rain Today," one of the finest performances of 
EXTD=her career. Completists might want to seek out the original vinyl
EXTD=, but for the rest of us, DUSTY IN LONDON is more than enough to 
EXTD=convince anyone of Dusty Springfield's interpretive genius.\n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nPut This Back In Print!, April 13, 20
EXTD=04 \nBy  Caesar M. Warrington (Lansdowne, PA United States]\n\nSo
EXTD=me of Dusty's best work is on this CD. Her rendition of "Piece of
EXTD=My Heart" just blows away Janis Joplin's original version. \n\nT
EXTD=his CD quickly came and went. Why? \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVI
EXTD=EW\nBrand new Dusty to American listeners is every bit as good, N
EXTD=ovember 25, 2000 \nBy A Customer\n\nDon't be put off by sceptics 
EXTD=who tell you to give this wonderful collection a miss. This may n
EXTD=ot be the Dusty American listeners are used to and know and love,
EXTD=but for my money, it's every bit as good. In these latter day Br
EXTD=itish recordings (1968-72) with the Philips label, you get to "se
EXTD=e all her faces". Displaying her incredible versatility, you get 
EXTD=to sample Dusty not only in lounge mode (ie, as a chanteuse) but 
EXTD=as soul mistress and pop/rock stylist (British style). These trac
EXTD=ks, extracted mainly from "Dusty Definitely (1968) and "See All H
EXTD=er Faces" (1972), stand tall as monuments of her recording histor
EXTD=y with the British label. Pity Rhino chose not to showcase them (
EXTD=including the UK recorded tracks from SAHF) in their entirety or 
EXTD=in their original running order. We have to wait for the omission
EXTD=s - all excellent - to show up in future compilations promised by
EXTD=Rhino. For those already familiar with these UK albums, there is
EXTD=a special treat in the previously unreleased "Sweet Inspiration"
EXTD=which is pure bubblegum transformed into a tasteful slice of sou
EXTD=l that's distinctively Dusty. Listening to this great collection 
EXTD=only makes the need for Mercury UK to release these albums in the
EXTD=ir original formats all the more pressing. In my opinion, it's to
EXTD=tally wrongheaded and arrogant for uninformed Stateside critics t
EXTD=o dismiss Dusty's Philips recordings as supperclub styled or ligh
EXTD=tweight compared to her more serious soul offerings with the Atla
EXTD=ntic label. Listeners will discover in these tracks the other sid
EXTD=e to Dusty that has made her the much loved singer she is with th
EXTD=e British public. This brand new Dusty (to Americans) is someone 
EXTD=you want to get to know. Trust me. Tune in and enjoy! \n\n\nAMAZO
EXTD=N.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDusty..eclectic as always..., October 4, 2
EXTD=002 \nBy  S. Sittig "Divawatch" (Washington, D.C.]\n\nThose of us
EXTD=that are long time fans of Miss Dusty Springfield know that she 
EXTD=would have been bored to tears if she had to sing the same old st
EXTD=yle of pop music every day. She loved variety. And this compilati
EXTD=on showcases exactly how eclectic her tastes were. Unfortunately,
EXTD=if the mood feels rather erratic, it's really more the fault of 
EXTD=the compilation itself and not Dusty's song choices or ability.\n
EXTD=\nNevertheless, the testament to Dusty's superb interpretive ear,
EXTD=is that there really is not a bad track on this compilation. Som
EXTD=e of the production values might be a bit askew and some of the m
EXTD=aterial might be bordering on schmaltz, but Dusty's delivery is n
EXTD=ever in question.\n\nStand-outs, for me at least, are "Mixed Up G
EXTD=irl", "Take Another Little Piece of My Heart" (which Dusty wisely
EXTD=skews more to the Erma Franklin original instead of the overblow
EXTD=n albeit more popular Janis Joplin cover), "How Can I Be Sure?", 
EXTD="Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone" and "Love Power".\n\nAnd th
EXTD=en there is the unique beauty of "Song For You", the gentle Bossa
EXTD=Nova style of "Come For A Dream", the sexually charged "Crumbs O
EXTD=ff The Table" and the heavily jazz inflected "I Only Wanna Laugh"
EXTD=\n\nAt times it's hard to believe the same singer is singing eac
EXTD=h song!\n\nName me another singer that could navigate such varied
EXTD=musical waters without having to come up for air at least occasi
EXTD=onally?\n\nThere is only one name that fits: Dusty Springfield\n\n
EXTD=End of conversation. If you don't believe me, just listen... \n\n
EXTD=\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDusty Shines on These London Record
EXTD=ings, March 2, 2007 \nBy  goodmusiclover\n\nDusty in London is a 
EXTD=cd packaged much like Dusty in Memphis, which was recored in 1969
EXTD=This London album is actually a consolodation of songs from '68
EXTD='71. There are many lovely photos in this product, (even more fl
EXTD=attering than the ones in the Memphis set). Songwise, I prefer th
EXTD=e Memphis album, but this rare, hard-to-get-your-hands on cd is a
EXTD=lso superb. Take Another Little Piece of My Heart is a wonderful 
EXTD=way to kick off the album, and How Can I Be Sure, Girls It Ain't 
EXTD=Easy, Another Night, and Sweet Inspiration are especially worth a
EXTD=listen. To prove what a talent Dusty was, her hauntingly beautif
EXTD=ul song on this cd, What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life, muc
EXTD=h in the mood of The Look of Love, can even be heard on a tv comm
EXTD=erical today. If you know which one I'm talking about, there is n
EXTD=o denying it is Dusty. She, like the other music greats, had such
EXTD=a distict voice that she is in a category all her own-- The Firs
EXTD=t White Lady of Soul. Today, March 2nd, is the anniversary of her
EXTD=death in 1999, and Karen Carpenter's 57th birthday. Dusty would 
EXTD=have been 68 in April. I know both ladies are greatly missed!!! \n
EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nmixed up girl, December 8, 2002 \n
EXTD=By A Customer\n\nTrue to form, this album contains many of Spring
EXTD=field's facets, but the stylistic and chronological "jumps" in th
EXTD=e sequecing of the tracks do a great disservice to the quality of
EXTD=the work. Dusty was indeed an eclectic performer (just as she wa
EXTD=s an eclectic listener), but she knew a thing or two about presen
EXTD=tation. I wish Rhino would have done one of two things: either pr
EXTD=esent the material as released in Britain - or sequence two cd's w
EXTD=orth of material in chronological order, allowing for some regrou
EXTD=ping of tracks to make it more litstener-friendly. This is defini
EXTD=tely great stuff, no doubt about it. I just worry that non-fans w
EXTD=ill be put off the lack of "flow" from song-to-song. \n\n\nAMAZON
EXTD=COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nIn a search of a right material, September 
EXTD=24, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\nOne of the best voices of 60-ies, Dus

EXTD=varried for her own good - always in a nice voice, Springfield to
