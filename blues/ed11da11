EXTD=ors' Choice Music simultaneously released four archival live albu
EXTD=ms by Jefferson Airplane in 2010, and three of them were recorded
EXTD=in the fall of 1966 at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.
EXTD=But there are big differences between the first two, Live at the
EXTD=Fillmore Auditorium 10/15/66: Late Show -- Signe's Farewell and

EXTD=race's Debut, and the third, Live at the Fillmore Auditorium 11/2
EXTD=5/66 and 11/27/66: We Have Ignition. As their titles indicate, the 
EXTD=first two albums chronicle the weekend in October when original f
EXTD=emale singer Signe Anderson made her last appearance with the ban
EXTD=d and Grace Slick, her replacement, made her first. The Anderson 
EXTD=album is bittersweet, and the Slick album is somewhat tentative, 
EXTD=as might be expected. But the third album, although recorded only
EXTD=six weeks later, follows a crucial experience for Jefferson Airp
EXTD=lane: they had spent most of the time in between in Los Angeles r
EXTD=ecording their second studio album for RCA Victor Records, Surrea
EXTD=listic Pillow. Indeed, from the superior sound quality of this tw
EXTD=o-CD set, it would not be surprising to discover that RCA's engin
EXTD=eers followed the band north with a portable tape machine to cut 
EXTD=its Thanksgiving weekend shows for a possible live album never re
EXTD=leased at the time. Here, Jefferson Airplane play many of the son
EXTD=gs from Surrealistic Pillow, as well as songs that were recorded 
EXTD=at the sessions but left off the album ("Go to Her," "JPP McStep 
EXTD=B. Blues," and "In the Morning," all of which turned up in their 
EXTD=studio renditions on the 1974 rarities LP Early Flight). So, spre
EXTD=ad across the several sets are multiple versions of "Plastic Fant
EXTD=astic Lover," "White Rabbit," "She Has Funny Cars," and "3/5 of a
EXTD=Mile in 10 Seconds," sounding much as they do on Surrealistic Pi
EXTD=llow, except that the live performances are more enthusiastic. Al
EXTD=so included are the rarely performed Surrealistic Pillow songs "D
EXTD=CBA-25" and "My Best Friend," as well as songs that had been in t
EXTD=he band's repertoire earlier, either from the debut album Jeffers
EXTD=on Airplane Takes Off ("It's No Secret," "Bringing Me Down") or f
EXTD=olk material adapted to electric rock ("High Flyin' Bird," "The O
EXTD=ther Side of This Life"). The only thing that's missing, amazingl
EXTD=y, is a performance of what would soon be the band's biggest hit,
EXTD="Somebody to Love." Within months of the release of Surrealistic
EXTD=Pillow, Jefferson Airplane had retired many of the album's songs
EXTD=from their live shows or developed arrangements very different f
EXTD=rom those heard on the LP. This collection presents them fresh fr
EXTD=om the studio, often sounding, if anything, better than on the no
EXTD=t-yet-released album that would mark Jefferson Airplane's commerc
