EXTD=2004 Elektra/Asylum Records, Inc.\n\nOriginally Released January 
EXTD=27, 2004\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Normally speaking, a box set of no
EXTD=thing but B-sides and unreleased tracks would only be of interest
EXTD=to rabid fans, but the Cure have never really been a "normal" ba
EXTD=nd. While their longevity alone -- nearly 25 years -- is certainl
EXTD=y the most obvious clue to their uniqueness, Robert Smith's true 
EXTD=charm lies in his ability to craft memorable songs that inspire n
EXTD=othing less than emotional fervor in his and the band's fans. Ove
EXTD=r the years, the band's singles have achieved high sales and char
EXTD=t placings in numerous countries, while the albums have become ic
EXTD=ons in themselves, with thousands of ex-gloomy teenagers being ab
EXTD=le to remember things based on when, say, Disintegration or Wish 
EXTD=hit stores. While this successful output would usually be enough 
EXTD=to cement a band's place in the big picture, Smith is also blesse
EXTD=d with the ability to compile his work in a fashion that is secon
EXTD=d to none. For example, one of the best moves that he and the ban
EXTD=d made was back in 1986, when they decided to pad the cassette re
EXTD=lease of their 1986 singles collection, Staring at the Sea, with 
EXTD=most of the B-sides dating back from 1978 (the remaining B-sides 
EXTD=from the era were collected on the Japanese Whispers LP). Now in 
EXTD=most cases, this would have been a minor annoyance, pulling away 
EXTD=from the strength of the singles (and those singles were not only
EXTD=strong, but incredibly diverse) and filling space with songs tha
EXTD=t are put on the backs of singles for a reason. But in this case,
EXTD=the Cure were just as good (and in some cases more outlandish) a
EXTD=t making B-sides as they were hits. Unfortunately, when it came t
EXTD=ime for the Cure to do it again in 1997 with the Galore collectio
EXTD=n, the B-sides were nowhere to be found. While neophytes may not 
EXTD=have even noticed, those in the know were disappointed, to say th
EXTD=e least. Where was "A Japanese Dream" or "Harold and Joe" or "2 Lat
EXTD=e"? Subsequently, fans had to hunt down singles, soundtracks, and
EXTD=compilations for these gems, while others were left in the dark 
EXTD=as to what the band wasn't making readily available. So it's a bl
EXTD=essing that the Cure's long and happy relationship with Fiction r
EXTD=ecords came to an end. Wisely, the band decided to start fresh up
EXTD=on signing with their new label by cleaning house, remastering th
EXTD=e old albums, and bringing their fans Join the Dots: B-Sides and Ra
EXTD=rities, 1978-2001. Not only is it the ultimate companion to the o
EXTD=fficial releases, but it is, in a way, the new-super-deluxe-updat
EXTD=ed version of that cassette release of Staring at the Sea. Every 
EXTD=B-side, in order, with cleaned-up sound, liner notes, and explana
EXTD=tions by the man who made it all happen. All tracks, from "10.15 
EXTD=Saturday Night" (the B-side to the debut single "Killing an Arab"
EXTD=) to covers of "Hello I Love You," "Purple Haze," and "World in M
EXTD=y Eyes," to entries from the Bloodflowers singles, are an indicat
EXTD=ion that while the Cure made both strong albums and singles, they
EXTD=were not afraid to experiment along the way, and more importantl
EXTD=y, they didn't let pride keep them from not making them available
EXTD=to those who were willing to look for them. Their growth as a ba
EXTD=nd can be fully tracked in the songs here, the wild development o
EXTD=n disc one (which includes the B-sides from the Staring at the Se
EXTD=a cassette, the B-sides from the Boys Don't Cry re-release from 1
EXTD=986, and the Japanese Whispers B-sides -- as well as the extremel
EXTD=y rare "Lament" [flexi-disc version]) -- is easily their stronges
EXTD=t and most diverse era, with Smith growing artistically and music
EXTD=ally in leaps and bounds from track to track. The rampant growth 
EXTD=eventually gives way to the dark and heavy pop of the B-sides of 
EXTD=Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Disintegration, and Mixed Up on disc t
EXTD=wo. While the songs are strong on this second disc, they manage t
EXTD=o have less of the wild, experimental abandon that disc one has. 
EXTD=The Cure began to find a real niche by this point, and by disc th
EXTD=ree, the dream pop of the late '80s had developed into the stadiu
EXTD=m-sized gloom and doom that characterized 1992's Wish, their crit
EXTD=ical and commercial peak. Eventually the band's output would beco
EXTD=me more sporadic, and the level of consistency would be more of a
EXTD=trademark of the band than the experimentalism of old. Disc four
EXTD=, which covers the time from Wild Mood Swings to Bloodflowers (an
EXTD=d the admittedly odd Greatest Hits collection), is the "weakest" 
EXTD=of the collection, but there are still great moments to be found,
EXTD=with many remixes that give the original tracks a new interpreta
EXTD=tion. There are those who would argue that the band grew, and oth
EXTD=er would argue that it fell apart, yet there is no denying that t
EXTD=he majority of work on Join the Dots is extraordinarily strong. I
EXTD=t admittedly may be a bit too much for someone who isn't quite a 
EXTD=big devotee of the band, but it's a veritable godsend for those w
EXTD=ho've been waiting for this for years. No jumbled, out-of-order t
EXTD=rack listings, no glaring omissions (it's safe to say that the re
EXTD=issues of the albums will take care of any extra tracks, mixes, e
EXTD=tc., lying around) -- it's exactly what a rarities/B-sides collec
EXTD=tion should be. Join the Dots: B-Sides and Rarities, 1978-2001 is p
EXTD=roof that, while the band may falter from time to time -- as most
EXTD=do -- the Cure has, unlike most, really been paying attention to
EXTD=their fans' needs over the years. Thank Rob for that. ~ Chris Tr
EXTD=ue\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nA testament to the Cure's expl
EXTD=osive creativity, Join the Dots is also an ode to the band's rema
EXTD=rkable consistency. Spanning the group's entire career, it'll kee
EXTD=p fans happily burrowing away for hours - days, even. Disc 1 conce
EXTD=ntrates on Robert Smith's early growth spurts, when his jerky got
EXTD=h-pop blossomed with depth and savvy. Disc 2 recycles some of Kis
EXTD=s Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me's motifs (there's a touch of "A Thousand H
EXTD=ours" in "Breath," for instance), and pays tribute to their early
EXTD=90s Mixed Up Madchester phase with "Harold and Joe." Elsewhere, 
EXTD=there are covers of "Young Americans," Depeche Mode's "World in M
EXTD=y Eyes," "Purple Haze," and three versions of the Doors' "Hello I
EXTD=Love You," as well as more recent material like an acoustic vers
EXTD=ion of "Maybe Someday" from 2000's Bloodflowers. The handsome pac
EXTD=kaging features a complete career retrospective partially narrate

EXTD=r "Critical Cure" (Thorofare, New Jersey United States]\n\nOk....
EXTD=I don't have this box set yet, probably because I've made my own 
EXTD=complete collection of all the B-Sides. Someday I'll remind mysel
EXTD=f to get this for the fact that it's an OFFICIAL release while mi
EXTD=ne is a mere creation of my own work. Anyway....this doesn't lose
EXTD=any stars for the fact that the Robert Smith has answered all th
EXTD=e fans requests since 1998's release of 'Galore - The Singles 198
EXTD=7-1997'. If you remember, it was released on (Limited Edition vin
EXTD=yl, cassette, and CD). All formats were the same, meaning it didn
EXTD='t include ANY B-Sides from 1987-1997, don't know why, I guess we
EXTD='ll never know why. At any rate, fans were quite preturbed to dis
EXTD=cover this so called "cheat" to Cure fans. 'Standing on the beach
EXTD=Staring At the sea - The Singles 1979-1985-86' included the B-
EXTD=Sides from '79-'85-'86 (cassette only). That is now out of print,
EXTD=and has been for some time now, 1995 to be precise. SO......with
EXTD=out further ado, here you have the long out of print B-Sides 1979
EXTD=1985, plus the long awaited B-Sides never before released in a c
EXTD=ollection of it's own, 1987-2001. "But...but....but....it doesn't
EXTD=have 'Carnage Visors', it doesn't have 'The Peel Sessions', uhhh
EXTD=h....it doesn't have the 'Curiosity' songs". GET OVER IT!!!! I'm 
EXTD=sure Robert Smith is well aware of all this and will release it a
EXTD=ccordingly. For fans who have the albums Faith, Pornography, and 
EXTD=Three Imaginary Boys'. You all know Rhino Records is releasing th
EXTD=ese in expanded editons, eventually. For all that are worried tha
EXTD=t they have to shell out more money for songs they already have, 
EXTD=do it anyway. "But what am I going to do with the copies of those

EXTD=M. Davis (Salt Lake City, Utah]\nThe Cure's four disc "Join The 
EXTD=Dots" boxed set is the rare box set that is a must have for both 
EXTD=comnpletists and novists alike. \nCompletists need it as it shows
EXTD=a complete alternate reality/history of The Cure (not to mention
EXTD=the wonderfully direct history of the band included in the liner
EXTD=notes). It parallels the many stages, phases, and styles that Ro
EXTD=bert Smith and the boys have experimented with and morphed in to 
EXTD=(and out of) while gathering the numerous rarities, b-sides, alte
EXTD=rnate versions and non-album tracks that The Cure have recorded o
EXTD=ver their 25 year career. \n\nNovists need this set because to be
EXTD=honest - nearly all of the songs are damn good. Many of these so
EXTD=ngs could have been on the albums proper (sometimes they were lef
EXTD=t off simply because they didn't fit the style of the album, or s
EXTD=ometimes the band had written an overabundance of quality materia
EXTD=l). "Pillbox Tales" (with Banshee Siouxsie Sioux on background wa
EXTD=iling) is good enough to be on either "Boys Don't Cry" or "Sevent
EXTD=een Seconds" but doesn't really fit into the style of either albu
EXTD=m. While "Charlotte Sometimes" b-side "Splintered In Her Head" wo
EXTD=uld have fit in on "Pornography" perfectly and foreshadowed what 
EXTD=was to come with that classic album.\n\nFrom there the songs even
EXTD=get better: "The Exploding Boy", "A Few Hours After This...", an
EXTD=d "Stop Dead" all could have been on "The Head on the Door" and l
EXTD=ikely would have been had this album been made in the CD, rather 
EXTD=than the casette, era. The traThe songs that are from the "Wish" 
EXTD=era on these CD's are among some of the strongest and I can't for
EXTD=the life of me understand why some of these tracks were left off
EXTD=of that album. "This Twilight Garden" is a flat-out masterpiece 
EXTD=that would have fit in on "Wish" or "Disintegration", while "Play
EXTD=" is an elegant and understated ballad. Furthermore, both "The Bi
EXTD=g Hand" and "A Foolish Arrangement" would have fit nicely as well
EXTD=as they are both moody pop gems that are similar to much of "Wis
EXTD=h". Heck, the cover art of "Wish" is even based on "The Big Hand"
EXTD=\n\nInterestingly, many of the tracks included on "Join The Dots
EXTD=" that were outtakes from "Wild Mood Swings" are more "classic" s
EXTD=ounding Cure than much of that album. "It Used To Be Me", "Ocean"
EXTD=, and "Adonais" are all maudlin Cure-esque ballads while "A Pink 
EXTD=Dream" is a frothy latter day Cure pop piece ala "Friday I'm In L
EXTD=ove", "High", or "Mint Car".\n\nFinally, "Coming Up" and "Possess
EXTD=ion" are "Bloodflowers" outtakes that indicate the original direc
EXTD=tion that album was to take. Both tracks are solid with hard rock
EXTD=/techno beat overtones in the general tone of "Wrong Number" from
EXTD="Galore". I will admit while I like these tracks I prefer the di
EXTD=rection "Bloodflowers" ended up going in.\n\nFinally, "Join The D
EXTD=ots" collects the various soundtrack and compilation album songs 
EXTD=the Cure have done. Some are excellent, like "Burn" from The Crow
EXTD=and "More Than This" from the X-Files. Others are interesting su
EXTD=ch as the Jimi Hendrix and Doors covers, while a couple are misse
EXTD=s - Judge Dredd's "Dredd Song". Finally, the amazing "Greatest Hi
EXTD=ts" outtake "Signal To Noise" which can serve as the single for t
EXTD=his box set (although not officially) which is a good enough song
EXTD=to beg the question as to why they are not recording a new album
EXTD=\n\nIf you own everything Cure or just the Greatest Hits - spend
EXTD=the $60 and get "Join The Dots".\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\n
EXTD=A Treasure for Cure Completists, March 4, 2004\nReviewer: Sandman
EXTD=VI (Glen Allen, VA United States]\nIf you are not a big Cure fan 
EXTD=then go away. This is not for you. If you are keep reading.\nIt's
EXTD=great to finally have all of those wonderful B-sides and raritie
EXTD=s in 1 place. And it's about time those great songs from the b-si
EXTD=de of the 'Staring at the Sea' tape got remastered (wasn't that o
EXTD=uttake collection called 'Standing on a Beach'). You'll also get 
EXTD=lots of remixes and covers. Having 3 versions of The Doors' cover
EXTD="Hello I Love You" seems excessive but I'd rather have more than
EXTD=less - wouldn't you? They also have the Bowie cover "Young Ameri
EXTD=cans". Wondering why they didn't include Hendrix' "Foxy Lady" tho
EXTD=ugh. Do you realize The Cure has done 3 Hendrix covers (Hey Joe, 
EXTD=Foxy Lady and Purple Haze)?\n\nThe most pleasant surprise was the
EXTD=inclusion of the painfully hard-to-find "To the Sky" from the b-
EXTD=side of the 'Concert' live tape release. The biggest disappointme
EXTD=nt is the non-inclusion of the excellent "Forever" from that same
EXTD=release. Why o' why can they not release this on CD?! And I'll b
EXTD=et you that it doesn't find it's way onto any of the upcoming stu
EXTD=dio remasters because it wasn't a b-side from any particular rele
EXTD=ase. Also missing are "Carnage Visors" and "Curiousity". Still th
EXTD=e collection is nearly complete and long overdue.\n\nThe packagin
EXTD=g is very nicely done. It looks like a long, thin hardcover book 
EXTD=(I didn't just say long, thin and hard did I?) and includes loads
EXTD=of color photos spanning the band's history. Also includes a nar
EXTD=rative history that I plan to read soon.\n\nOK now, less reading.
EXTD=more buying.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nI Won't Lie, Not E
EXTD=verything The Cure Make Is Good., February 19, 2004\nReviewer: R.
EXTD=Brown "fallchildren" (HSV, AR]\nSo let's get this out of the way
EXTD=right away. In my personal opinion pretty much everything starti
EXTD=ng with "Boys Don't Cry" and ending with "Disintegration" is the 
EXTD=only Cure stuff worth even considering. Let's face it, the albums
EXTD=went down hill fast. "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" shows the song 
EXTD=writing ability of a drunken retard, "Blood Flowers" was a close-
EXTD=but-no-cigar attempt at getting back into the mood of "Pornograph
EXTD=y" and "Disintegration", and "Wild Mood Swings" is just awful. Ok
EXTD=ay, I'll give you "Wish", "Wish" is the only great album The Cure
EXTD=have made since 89'. Which leads me, instantly, to tell you that
EXTD=Discs 3 and 4 on this collection are worthless. \nDisc Four is v
EXTD=ariant/remixed versions of stuff on "Wild Mood Swings" and "Blood
EXTD=Flowers", did we really need a remix of "Out Of This World" argua
EXTD=bly the only good song on Bloodflowers? I mean, come on, it's a s
EXTD=omber acoustic guitar song, and now it has fat funky booty beats 
EXTD=and microwave malfunction sounds? The only good song on Disc Four
EXTD=is "This is a Lie" the only tolerable song on Wild Mood Swings, 
EXTD=and the mix is basically just all string instruments, it's pretty
EXTD=, i'll say it.\n\nDisc Three starts off with B-sides from "Wish",
EXTD=which is an album I like to begin with, and the B-sides are obvi
EXTD=ously related to the feeling of that album, so those were songs I
EXTD=liked. However, disc three trails off into a bunch of horrible s
EXTD=ongs that The Cure had made for various sound tracks. Oh and just
EXTD=in case you weren't enjoying yourself enough as it is, there are
EXTD=three versions of The Cure covering "Purple Haze" mixed in with 
EXTD="Wild Mood Swings" B-sides, a true excersize in torture. The only
EXTD=redeeming things on this disc are the "Wish" b-sides, and the so
EXTD=ng "Burn" which The Cure did for the movie "The Crow", I consider
EXTD=this to be their best song ever (hence the reason robert smith l
EXTD=umped it in on the crap disc in the box set).\n\nDisc Two starts 
EXTD=off bad with "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" B-sides, get's better wi
EXTD=th the Disintegration b-sides, but then goes back to bad when I h
EXTD=ave to listen to three intolerable covers of The Doors song "Hell
EXTD=o I Love You". God kill me now, please.\n\nDisc One is the best d
EXTD=isc in the box. It includes B-sides from "Boys Don't Cry", "Seven
EXTD=teen Seconds", "Faith", some variant stuff from "Japanese Whisper
EXTD=s", and some select B-sides from "Head on the Door"-era Cure. I r
EXTD=eally like this disc, and wish I could say all the others were as
EXTD=good. This disc is the reason I passed the box-set off with thre
EXTD=e stars.\n\nHere's the big problem I had with the box. NO PORNOGR
EXTD=APHY B-SIDES!!! Pornography is my favorite album from The Cure, a
EXTD=nd I was hoping and praying that this box-set would have some rar
EXTD=e or variant stuff that hadn't been released that would be on her
EXTD=e for me to dance like a giddy school girl in the joy of it's pre
EXTD=sence, but no. And I think there could have been more Disintegrat
EXTD=ion stuff, I've got singles that have some B-sides from Disintegr
EXTD=ation that weren't on the box. Anyway, I was thoroughly disappoin
EXTD=ted by this Box Set, it's been a while since I've been able to sa
EXTD=y I bought anything new from The Cure that was awesome, and unfor
EXTD=tunately I have to keep waiting. One upside to the Box Set you as
EXTD=k? The book that it comes in is cool.\n\nKey Songs: Leave me alon

EXTD=homas Horan (Chapel Hill, NC]\n\nThis pretty terrific box of b-si
EXTD=des and rarities was originally issued in the UK and has now been
EXTD=released here in America. Though it's a welcome collection anywh

EXTD=by songs which most US fans have already, while some material th
EXTD=at's probably easier to obtain in England is sadly excluded. \nFo

EXTD=The Dream, The Upstairs Room, Lament, and Speak My Language have 
EXTD=all been available for years in America on such albums as Japanes

EXTD=e Visors, and the club mix of the Boys Don't Cry single were only
EXTD=briefly available in America (generally on cassette) and at stif
EXTD=f import prices. Maybe these gems will appear as bonus tracks on 
EXTD=the forthcoming reissues, but it's an expensive hassle to rebuy a
EXTD=lbums you've had and played for years just for a handful of other
EXTD=wise ungettable tunes that could easily have been included here. 
EXTD=So much exquisite care went into the liner notes and packaging of
EXTD=this four-disc set that it might have been worth the extra time 
EXTD=to prepare a US version to satisfy Cure completists on this side 
EXTD=of the pond. \n\nI also think there are some rare but useless son
EXTD=gs on this compilation that again just fill space. Do we really n
EXTD=eed multiple versions of mediocre covers like Hello I Love You an
