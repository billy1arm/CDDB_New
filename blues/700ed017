EXTD=Interestingly, JIMMY REED AT CARNEGIE HALL is not a concert album
EXTD=(technical and contractual difficulties prevented taping the act
EXTD=ual event), but a studio recreation of the Carnegie Hall set Reed
EXTD=and his band played several days before the recording. Still, th
EXTD=e album has the loose, spontaneous feel of a live session, with R
EXTD=eed's simple, propulsive guitar playing, keening harmonica, and b
EXTD=ehind-the-beat singing in exceptional working order. Abetted by g
EXTD=uitarist "Lefty" Bates, drummer Earl Phillips, and Reed's wife, "
EXTD=Mama" (whose sweet backing vocals are an integral thread in the f
EXTD=abric of the music), Reed turns in a wonderful performance.\n\nTh
EXTD=e generous 23-song set list, nearly all Reed originals, includes 
EXTD=some of the performer's best tunes, including the chugging "Brigh
EXTD=t Lights, Big City," the insistent "Ain't That Lovin' You Baby," 
EXTD=and the slow-burning "You Don't Have to Go." The music is steeped
EXTD=in the primal, hypnotic rhythms of the Delta tradition, with a d
EXTD=ash of savvy electric Chicago blues for balance, but the overall 
EXTD=vibe is warm and mellow. The set is characterized by Reed's trade
EXTD=mark muted, swampy sound, which would go on to influence a genera
EXTD=tion of young bluesmen and rockers.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW
EXTD=\nJimmy Reed's hits from the original master tapes, July 26, 2004
EXTD=\nReviewer: Bradley Olson (Bemidji, MN United States) \nThis was 
EXTD=Jimmy's best selling album ever but the title is very misleading 
EXTD=in that these are all studio recordings, not live recordings, whi

EXTD=were on all previous issues in rechanneled stereo while the true 
EXTD=stereo tracks on this disc have always been in true stereo on eve
EXTD=ry release. Steve Hoffman searched high and low for the first gen
EXTD=eration tapes of each song on the album in the Vee Jay vaults and
EXTD=as a result, Audio Fidelity has issued the definitive release of
EXTD=the album. Audiophiles and casual blues fans who like quality so
EXTD=und must pick up this issue of Jimmy Reed At Carnegie Hall as it 
EXTD=contains most of his biggest hits in the best possible quality so
EXTD=und due to the work of Steve Hoffman.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVI

EXTD=Docendo Discimus (Vita scholae]\nThis CD was originally issued as
EXTD=a double LP by Vee-Jay in the early '60s, and the title is decid

EXTD=hich made up the first of the two original vinyl LPs, are some ni

EXTD=James Reed's nasal, badly articulated vocal delivery, simple, two
EXTD=string boogie patterns, and virtual inability on the harmonica, 
EXTD=but the record buying public loved him, and he frequently crossed

EXTD=in the 1950s. And Reed outsold everybody from Muddy Waters and H

EXTD=The story of Jimmy Reed is a tragic one, really. Illiterate, alco
EXTD=holic and stricken with undiagnosed epilepsy, Reed was ill equipp

EXTD=Mary (known to fans as "Mama" Reed) did everything she could to k

EXTD=]\nCollectable Records recently reissued JIMMMY REED AT CARNEGIE 
EXTD=HALL a Vee-Jay album(VJLP 1035) originally released in 1961. The 
EXTD=first eleven songs are a recreation of performance Jimmy Reed gav
EXTD=e at the "Blues at Carnegie" series(per the liner notes). The lin
EXTD=er notes state that the reason the recording could not be done at
EXTD=Carnegie Hall was due to "technical and contractural problems" s
EXTD=o the album ended up being recorded at New York City's Bell Sound
EXTD=Studios. Some new tunes, at the time, were written for the Carne
EXTD=gie performance such as "Blue Carnegie"(instrumental) and "Blue, 
EXTD=blue, blue." It also includes such Reed classics such as "Ah Shuc
EXTD=ks,Hush Your Mouth" and "Bright Lights Big City", the first song 
EXTD=on the album. The twelve remaining cuts is a best of Jimmy Reed s
EXTD=ongsfest which are faithful rerecordings of his best known songs.
EXTD="Take Out Some Insurance" is the only song not written by Jimmy 
EXTD=Reed. Although it has the same feel as a Jimmy Reed song the line
EXTD=r notes state that he hated it. Though his singing is sometimes s
EXTD=lurred and out of tune, the sound of the blows on his harmonica a
EXTD=nd his guitar, sometimes accompanied by Eddie Taylor on bass guit
EXTD=ar, make his blues songs shine. This cd is a faithul reproduction
