EXTD=eased May 23, 2006 \n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  For five years in th
EXTD=e early '70s Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders headed up a loose-kni
EXTD=t club band in the San Francisco area (the group never had an off
EXTD=icial name) specializing in a graceful mix of jazz, R&B, blues, g
EXTD=ospel, and light funk with hints of bop, fusion, and even reggae.
EXTD=Aside from the two-volume Live at Keystone (1973), most of the g
EXTD=roup's recorded output appeared on various Saunders releases on F
EXTD=antasy Records, and this remarkably cohesive compilation picks ke
EXTD=y tracks from all of these, with roughly half of the set coming f
EXTD=rom the Keystone LPs. Garcia is in full flight here as a guitaris
EXTD=t, with Saunders' soul-jazz organ giving things a wonderfully flu
EXTD=id feel, and the end result is a kind of laid-back West Coast jaz
EXTD=z-rock that is very much the sum of its parts. Among the highligh
EXTD=ts in what is a very strong sequence are the nearly 12-minute ver
EXTD=sion of "Mystery Train" that opens things here, the floating eleg
EXTD=ance of the instrumental "Merl's Tune," the fusion-feel "Welcome 
EXTD=to the Basement" with a guest shot from the Tower of Power Horns,
EXTD=and an interesting take on Jimmy Cliff's "The Harder They Come,"
EXTD=which was still a relatively unknown tune when this version was 
EXTD=recorded in 1973. Jerry Garcia and Grateful Dead fans will no dou
EXTD=bt appreciate all of this, but Well-Matched also functions as a k
EXTD=ind of introduction to Saunders as well, whose good-natured and p
EXTD=op-inflected approach to soul-jazz deserves to be better known.

EXTD=ry Garcia and keyboardist Merle Saunders, a mellow fusion of R&B,
EXTD=jazz, and blues, may be familiar to Grateful Dead fans, but it i
EXTD=s less well-known by the public at large. Garcia, Saunders, and t
EXTD=heir band played together for about five years in the early 1970s

EXTD=g that time.\n\nHalf the tracks are from the '73 double-album LIV
EXTD=E AT KEYSTONE, and the other half are culled from the band's appe
EXTD=arances on Saunders's solo albums. There are a few originals, but
EXTD=the group primarily specialized in interpretive covers, with Bob
EXTD=Dylan's "Positively 4th Street" and Jimmy Cliff's "The Harder Th

EXTD=llent showcase for Garcia's guitar playing, giving full range to 
EXTD=his versatility and skill as a musician, and Saunders's soul-jazz

EXTD=t Vernon, NY USA]\n\nI mightily enjoyed watching Merl Saunders and 
EXTD=Jerry Garcia perform in the smaller venues they played at during 
EXTD=the early to mid '70's especially at the Bottom Line in NYC. 'Wel
EXTD=l-Matched' is not only a very appropriate title, but for those wh
EXTD=o mainly know Garcia's main body of work, this disc will shed a g
EXTD=limpse as to what Saunders and Garcia were concocting during their 
EXTD=extremely fertile musical period, which also served as a excellen
EXTD=t alternative to what Jerry was doing with the Dead. From my pers
EXTD=pective- Merl infected Garcia with a lot of blues, soul, funk, an
EXTD=d jazz, and as part time band member Martin Fierro told me, "Garc
EXTD=ia took to Merl like a sponge, and had that nimble ability to abs
EXTD=orb and apply various styles and genres of music into his already
EXTD=expansive repertoire.' Precisely! \n\nAll of the songs on this C

EXTD=us 'Live at the Keystone' recordings, with lone exception of the 
EXTD=so-so cover of Smokey Robinson's 'I Second That Emotion.' But blu
EXTD=es fans will dig the 11:32 cover of 'Mystery Train' which opens t
EXTD=he recording, and the Doc Pomus authored 'Lonely Avenue' will kno
EXTD=ck you on your butt with its soulful background vocalists, Merl's
EXTD=solid B3, and Jerry's guitar explodes on this very straight-ahea
EXTD=d blues cover. JJ Cale's 'After Midnight' is also another highlig
EXTD=ht, Merl's solid B3 is reminiscent of many of the great soulful-f
EXTD=unky recordings made by the likes of McGriff, McDuff, and Dr. Lon
EXTD=nie Smith with the only difference being Jerry's very strong and up
EXTD=beat vocals, and his extremely creative guitar playing. The late 
EXTD=great Vassar Clements shows up along with David Grisman for a spi
EXTD=rited version of Jimmy Rogers 'That's Alright.' One of funkiest t
EXTD=racks on this disk is Saunders 'Welcome to the Basement' with mem
EXTD=bers of the Tower of Power Horn section, check out John Kahn's de
EXTD=ep bass phrasings, Merl's various heady keyboard playing, and the
EXTD=outstanding horn charts by the Bay areas greatest soul-funk band
EXTD=TOP. \n\nExcellent liner notes by long time Dead affiliate Blai
EXTD=r Jackson, and the disk was compiled by the nationally syndicated
EXTD=Grateful Dead Hour's- David Gans. Additionally, the CD's packagi
EXTD=ng. is assembled as such- as a matchbook, with strike strip on th
EXTD=e back, which is very fitting as it appropriately signifies the f
EXTD=iery display of musicianship throughout this very enjoyable recor
EXTD=ding. Saunders and Garcia were definitely 'Well-Matched' Hopefully 
EXTD=Concord will continue to dig through its Fantasy vaults for more 
EXTD=Saunders and Garcia recordings, as this is one very fine collaborat
EXTD=ion that needs and deserves additional documenting. \n\nBob Putig
