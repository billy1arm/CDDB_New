EXTD=The Raveonettes take their love and worship of the Jesus and Mary
EXTD=Chain to new heights on their sophomore release, Pretty in Black
EXTD=The Mary Chain's debut, Psychocandy, was a thrilling collision 
EXTD=of extreme noise and sticky-sweet melodies - the Raveonettes' debu
EXTD=t, Chain Gang of Love, followed the same formula and came up with
EXTD=similarly thrilling results. The Jesus and Mary Chain's second a
EXTD=lbum, Darklands, stripped away almost all the noise and gave the 
EXTD=group's sound a by-the-numbers feel that was only saved by some g
EXTD=reat songs and the Reid brothers' personas. The Raveonettes plot 
EXTD=the same course on Pretty in Black. None of the songs have the '5
EXTD=0s rockabilly in a wind tunnel feel, nor do they sound remotely d
EXTD=angerous, exciting, or even fun. The album is subdued and overly 
EXTD=polished, with a preponderance of thin drum sounds, stock guitar 
EXTD=sounds, and uninspired singing from both Sune Rose Wagner and Sha
EXTD=rin Foo. That's not to say that they should have released Chain G
EXTD=ang, Pt. 2, but it would have been nice to have retained some of 
EXTD=that record's sonic wildness and overall sense of fun and adventu
EXTD=re. Plus, none of the songs here come within a mile of capturing 
EXTD=the joy and sonic thrill exhibited by moments from Chain Gang of 
EXTD=Love like "That Great Love Sound," "Heartbreak Stroll," or "The L
EXTD=ove Gang." The few songs that stir up some noise, like "Sleepwalk
EXTD=ing" or "Twilight," do so in a way that is very predictable, and 
EXTD=the ballads are lightweight to the point of being completely forg
EXTD=ettable. Only a couple of songs make a positive impression (the l
EXTD=ilting "Here Comes Mary" and laid-back summer tune "Red Tan"), an
EXTD=d even then they would have been the weakest songs on Chain Gang 
EXTD=of Love. The biggest nail in the coffin is their flat and irrelev
EXTD=ant cover of the Angels' "My Boyfriend's Back" (which was co-writ
EXTD=ten by producer Richard Gottehrer back in the mid-'60s), but ther
EXTD=e are problems everywhere you look. They rope in Mo Tucker to pla
EXTD=y drums, Martin Rev to provide drum machines, and Ronnie Spector 
EXTD=to warble some background vocals, and their contributions are pre
EXTD=tty negligible -- it seems like they were brought on just to give
EXTD=the record some hipster cred. Spector's presence on the Phil Spe
EXTD=ctor-in-a-teacup "Ode to L.A." just points up the song's shortcom
EXTD=ings, and making her sing the "whoah oh ohs" from "Be My Baby" is
EXTD=so obvious that it is almost embarrassing. Besides, Eddie Money 
EXTD=beat them to the punch by about 20 years. The mock spaghetti West
EXTD=ern track "Somewhere in Texas" is pretty corny lyrically and musi
EXTD=cally. In fact, most of the lyrics are corny, sometimes drifting 
EXTD=into shamefully bad ("Love in a Trashcan," "Uncertain Times"). Pr
EXTD=inting them was probably not a good idea. Precious little on Pret
EXTD=ty in Black would fall under the category of good idea, though. T
EXTD=he choices that Wagner and Gottherer make regarding the sound of 
EXTD=the album strip away the very things that made the band worthwhil
EXTD=e and, unlike on Darklands, the songs that remain are not strong 
EXTD=enough to carry the weight. A major disappointment to say the lea
EXTD=st, Pretty in Black is such an indifferent and transparent record
EXTD=that it makes one reconsider the quality of the album that prece
EXTD=ded it. Now that is the mark of a bad album.
