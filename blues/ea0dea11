EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nThe good news is that this CD brings together all of the early recorded output of this East Bay ska-punk band, including the A and B sides from various 7" singles, a few compilation cuts, and tracks from the band's split album with th
EXTT0=e Suicide Machines. The bad news is the same as the good news: this CD brings together all of the band's recorded output from the 1990-1993 period, and not all of it is exactly essential. But quite a bit of it is great, and Asian Man CDs list for a
EXTT0=bout ten bucks, so this album can be recommended with confidence to anyone nostalgic for the third wave ska sound of the early '90s. A few tracks are typical to the point of blandness, such as the pedestrian "Martians Don't Skank" and "Dine in Cros
EXTT0=sfire." But the bright spots on this program are pretty intensely bright: the deeply Clash-influenced "Scapegoat" and "Wailing Paddle," the angular "Spoon," a jig-time ska shanty called "Plank," and the slow, muddy skank of "What's Cooking" (when s
EXTT0=ka-punk bands slowed down like this, that was the acid test, and the Rudiments passed with flying colors). This collection is recommended.  Rick Anderson
