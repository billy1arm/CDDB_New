EXTD=RT REVIEW:  Three years after her debut, Julie Is Her Name, Julie
EXTD=London returned to the intimate jazz guitar and bass backing tha
EXTD=t resulted in a Top Ten album and single (the still-popular "Cry 
EXTD=Me a River"). You can almost see the cigar-smoking executives at 
EXTD=Liberty Records planning this one out -- "Hey, if the public love
EXTD=d it the first time, they're bound to love it again, right?" Well
EXTD=, to give the cigar-chompers some credit, Julie London favored th
EXTD=is backing for her live performances and she originally had to fi

EXTD=very uptown singer -- from Johnny Mathis to Chet Baker to Sarah V
EXTD=aughan -- was recording with a guitar/bass duo after Julie Is Her
EXTD=Name hit big, so why not the lady who started it all? For once, 
EXTD=pandering to the public equaled taking the artistic high road, be
EXTD=cause while Julie Is Her Name, Vol. 2 may not be as fresh or unex
EXTD=pected as its predecessor, it actually stands up as a slightly st
EXTD=ronger album. London's breathy vocals aren't that different, but 
EXTD=she seems more confident and she swings more, even on the ballads
EXTD=Howard Roberts may not have been a "name guitarist" like Barney
EXTD=Kessel, who played on the debut, but his work here is strong and
EXTD=bassist Red Mitchell lays an entire rhythm section worth of foun
EXTD=dation for London to stretch out on. This album was also better r
EXTD=ecorded than London's debut and the release has a fuller, richer 
EXTD=sound to it. Since the plunging-neckline album cover to London's 
EXTD=debut was talked about as much as the music, Liberty Records deci
EXTD=ded to continue the concept by literally putting spotlight beams 
EXTD=on the famed beauty's chest. Thankfully, Julie London had enough 
EXTD=jazz credentials and focused vocal talent that such blatant chees
EXTD=ecake shots remain of secondary importance to the music contained

EXTD=s been written about Julie London's terrifically sexy and underst
EXTD=ated voice, but this is where it all began. These two albums ("Ju
EXTD=lie Is Her Name" was her debut) best capture the sound associated
EXTD=with her- a soft voice with just guitar and bass (Barney Kessel 
EXTD=and Ray Leatherwood on "JIHN" - Howard Roberts and Red Mitchell on
EXTD="Volume II"). Julie's definitive classic, "Cry Me A River", is t
EXTD=he first track here and sets the tone for what follows. The catch
EXTD=: these two concept albums, recorded in 1955 and 1958, respective
EXTD=ly, were not meant to be heard as one continuous piece, and the c
EXTD=ombined length may diffuse some of the energy here. You may want 
EXTD=to play tracks 1-13 and come back later for 14-25. And if you're 
EXTD=only going to buy one Julie London disc (or, rather, think you're
EXTD=only going to buy one) I'd go for Rhino's "Time For Love" first-
EXTD=these are classics, but that one's a better overview. \n\n\nAMAZ
