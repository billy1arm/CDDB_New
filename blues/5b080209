EXTD=----------------------------------------------\nfrom RollingSton
EXTD=e.com\n\nAl Green, from Forrest City, Arkansas, has risen from ob
EXTD=scurity to fame with a rapidity that is astonishing even by the s
EXTD=tandards of the mercurial music industry. His unusually expressiv
EXTD=e voice, and the simple, spare arrangements of producer Willie Mi
EXTD=tchell, fit together with the kind of seamless perfection that ch
EXTD=aracterized the Redding/Cropper collaboration. Green's records so
EXTD=und like they were bound to happen - for the listener who digs sou
EXTD=l music, the fact that two-and-a-half million people have bought 
EXTD=the single version of "Let's Stay Together" can only be the icing
EXTD=on a very tasty cake.\n\nThe flexibility of Green's voice is som
EXTD=ething to marvel at. He can croon, shout, scat, rise to the smoot
EXTD=hest of falsettos, and throw in the funkiest growls, all in the c
EXTD=ourse of a single tune. A debt to Sam Cooke, and to Otis Redding,
EXTD=is evident from time to time, but Green's overall approach, his 
EXTD=particular sound, is consistently his own. The fact that he write
EXTD=s or cowrites most of his material, and gets such sympathetic bac
EXTD=king from the Memphis musicians who work at Hi, helps explain the
EXTD=flow and unified feeling of both his albums, but still one suspe
EXTD=cts that only Green could have pulled it off.\n\nAl Green Gets Ne
EXTD=xt To You is a damn-near-perfect LP, a funky LP, and for all its 
EXTD=diversity a consistent LP. The new album is even more homogeneous
EXTD=, somewhat mellower - and the title tune dominates it in the same 
EXTD=way "Satisfaction" dominated Out of Our Heads. The comparison is 
EXTD=made even more apt by the fact that London Records, Hi's parent c
EXTD=ompany, has sold as many copies of "Let's Stay Together" as they 
EXTD=sold of "Satisfaction."\n\nThe only problem with making a single 
EXTD=that achieves the status of an instant classic is making an album
EXTD=that doesn't sound shallow by comparison. The Let's Stay Togethe
EXTD=r LP fares far better than the majority of albums built around si
EXTD=ngle hits. In fact, the first side, which begins with the Monster
EXTD=, manages to maintain a steady groove and a high level right on t
EXTD=hrough to the last cut, "Old Time Lovin'," which has a warm, enve
EXTD=loping vocal and some of the best chop-rhythm guitar this side of
EXTD=heaven.\n\nThe second side has one of the album's very best song
EXTD=s, Green's "It Ain't No Fun To Me," which starts out like a funky
EXTD=blues and builds into a steamrolling shouter that won't quit. It
EXTD=also has the album's only disappointing cut, a six-minutes-plus 
EXTD=version of the Bee Gees' "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart." Green
EXTD=sings it beautifully, and the string arrangement is tasteful and
EXTD=as minimal in its way as the understated playing of the Hi studi
EXTD=o band. But the song is extended to the point where its mellownes
EXTD=s becomes a kind of slow nod into unconsciousness, and what start
EXTD=ed out sounding like sweet soul music leaves a burnt metal aftert
EXTD=aste of muzak. This in itself isn't so bad - what's scary is that 
EXTD=the press release accompanying the album plays the song up as if 
EXTD=it were the highlight of the set.\n\nIf this song is the beginnin
EXTD=g of a trend in Al Green's music, away from the soulfully mellow 
EXTD=and into the laid-back banal, then it's an instance of a trend th
EXTD=at seems particularly endemic to the Memphis scene. Both Sun and 
EXTD=Stax built their reputations on a series of country-simple record
EXTD=s that sold precisely because they were so much more vital, visce
EXTD=ral, and pure than anything the competition had to offer. In both
EXTD=cases, the companies went downhill when they adapted the excesse
EXTD=s of the competition they had so recently superceded. In order to
EXTD=keep their essentially simple formulas from starting to sound li
EXTD=ke the same old thing, they added strings, brass arrangements, an
EXTD=d vapid material from the hit parade, and expanded their operatio
EXTD=ns to the point where a distinctive one-studio, one-band sound co
EXTD=uld no longer be maintained. The point is that it was not only th
EXTD=e connoisseur listeners and hard-core fans who suffered - the comp
EXTD=anies and their artists suffered economically as well.\n\nHappily
EXTD=, it hasn't happened to Al Green and to Hi Records, at least not 
EXTD=yet. Their position in the vanguard of a new resurgence of Memphi
EXTD=s music is both enviable and almost frighteningly exposed. The wo
EXTD=rld will be watching to see whether the Green/Mitchell team can d
EXTD=eliver new treasures, and go on to even greater successes, withou
EXTD=t sacrificing the just-right balance, the purity, the unity of Gr
EXTD=een's first two albums. Meanwhile, Let's Stay Together is, like i
EXTD=ts predecessor, an indispensable treat.  -- BOB PALMER  (Posted:
