EXTD=uce Eder\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nFew women have expanded the vocabulary of rock as bewitchingly as Kate Bush - among male stars, only Prince may have taken as many risks. Hounds of Love saw Bush reining in the kookier aspects of The Dreaming, 
EXTD=channelling them into epic electro-pop that tackled big issues of life and death and God with gripping drama and intensity. "Running Up That Hill" was one of the great singles of the '80s - "Cloudbusting" was string-driven, magically pretty - "Jig of L

EXTD=a throbbing, tribal drumbeat, and is the strongest track. "Big Sky" utilizes Bushes etheral voice and passionate vocals. "Cloudbursting" is interesting, had a pretty cool video with Donald Sutherland, and creates a weird drama to the song. "Dream of

EXTD=rt Rock, Alternative Pop/Rock, College Rock \nRelease Date: 1997(1985-6,1988) \n\nThis entirely self-written and produced album was a huge success for Kate both in England and overseas, the single "Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)" being a hit 
EXTD=in America. She produced it all inside her own private studio at her house in England, and when released in September of 1985, it knocked Madonna's "Like A Virgin" off the top of the album charts. \n\nThe success is understandable, as this is Kate's 
EXTD=best album to date. However the two halves of it are very different. There is the first half of the album entitled "Hounds Of Love" and features the more commercial, pop-orientated arrangements and tunes on the album. The second half is a mini concep
EXTD=t album called "The Ninth Wave" in which Kate tells the story of a drowning woman which may end with her surviving and waking up, or dying and being reborn. This was extremely ground-breaking and sounds like nothing else that came out of the '80s and
EXTD=is therefore not dated in the least today. It's a shame that movie plans for this concept fell through. Everyone who brought this album the first time around probably brought it for the four hit songs packed on side one, the only non-single being a 
EXTD=strange song ("Mother Stands For Comfort" that would only be out of place with the rest of "The Ninth Wave" for the mood ring synthesizers. It too could have been a hit single with the crashing glass sounds (used also on "Running Up That Hill" and an
EXTD=earlier Kate masterpiece "Babooshka"), cold piano, and warm electronic waves. All four singles are spectacular, and even groundbreaking on "Cloudbusting", a beautiful if not instantly catchy number full of strings and heavy drums about a machine tha
EXTD=t makes it rain. Kate rocks out on "Hounds Of Love" and "The Big Sky" and performs with sensual and energetic catharticity on "Running Up That Hill". Full, bewitching and layered pop/rock is not where the album description ends. \n\nRiding the death-
EXTD=whale that is "The Ninth Wave" Kate moves on to haunting territory with the sentimental sounding "And Dream Of Sheep" (Kate sings and plays the piano beautifully) that leads onto the tense and brilliant "Under Ice" which stirs up the imagery of a sno
EXTD=wy day with a tragic accident waiting underneath the ice on the lake, through to the calm but ominous and eventually terrifying "Waking The Witch", then onto the mellow "Watching You Without Me". Sampling is used very expertly on all of those tracks.
EXTD=Kate then experiments further with the Irish sounds used on 1982's "The Dreaming" album with the dramatic, unforgettably epic "Jig Of Life" (Complete with recited poetry by her brother John during the climax). Then the creepy "Hello Earth" breathes 
EXTD=down your neck like a scene out of "Nosferatu" during the dark cathedral chants before Kate is reborn in some way through the light and bouncy "The Morning Fog". \n\nArguably the best and most enduring album released in the 1980's, this is widely reg
EXTD=arded as Kate's masterpiece. It shows off all her best qualities and in their best light. The British reissue in 1997 by EMI adds 2 uneventful remixes (although the commentaries on the appearances of clouds by the disguised voices of Kate and her bro

EXTD=e Kind To My Mistakes", although good, would have made a better inclusion on a future re-issue of 1989's "The Sensual World". "The Handsome Cabin Boy" or "Not This Time" would have been better. Also, the Orgonon remix of "Cloudbusting" should have be

EXTD=r most successful, and yet it may be her least accessible. Certainly it contains a much wider musical range than most albums in 1985, what with the drums, guitars and pianos, followed by the bouzoukis, fiddles, uillean pipes, cellos and balalaikas. T

EXTD=ttic where they are dancing to a strange foreign runway. "The Hounds of Love" is next and it is probably the song I care about the least. But then there is the joyful cheeriness of "The Big Sky." Then there is the carefully understated "Mother Stands
EXTD=for Comfort," ("She knows that I've been doing something wrong/But she won't say anything.") "Cloudbusting," one of Kate Bush's triumphs, refers to William Reich and his crackpot belief that by manipulating "orgone energy" (energy from orgasms) he c
EXTD=ould make it rain. Yet the song is a moving success, with its cello-driven melody, notwithstanding the fact that in both the song and the video Bush is playing a boy. ("Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen/And I don't know when/But 
EXTD=just saying it could even make it happen."]\nThen there is the second side, "The Ninth Wave." The songs are all clearly different from each other, in style and tempo and instrumentation, and they discuss such subjects as sleeping, ice-skating, witch-
EXTD=hunts, ghosts, Irish jigs, the evening and a statement of love. But they are all united in their theme about a drowning woman. It starts off with the apparently soft and increasingly sinister "And Dream of Sheep." ("Like poppies, heavy with seed/They
EXTD=take me deeper and deeper"). Then there is the short, effective and quite chilling violin driven "Under Ice." The dramatic "Waking the Witch" follows, where Bush is confronted by a demonic inquisitor and which contains the aforementioned Pink Floyd 
EXTD=reference, a forceful drumbeat as well as a brief sequence of bells. But the best cut is "Watching you Without Me," about the strange ghostlike presence, which is my favourite Kate Bush song of all. Here her voice, singing relatively understated mate
EXTD=rial, shows off its true power and nuance. Then there is "Jig of Life" as well as "Hello Earth." The latter is the longest song on the album, as it starts off with childish innocence (Hello Earth/With just one hand help up high/I can blot you out,) a
EXTD=nd then moves on to a threatening storm. Finally there is "The Morning Fog," with its simple melody, relatively simple arrangement and genuine expression of love for her family. (The 1998 CD includes six other songs, including remixes of "Running up 
EXTD=that Hill" and "The Big Sky." The four unreleased songs are all good, though they do not cohere with the original album. The best of them is "Burning Bridge."]\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe most brilliant mystical masterpiece in rock, March 
EXTD=14, 2003\nReviewer: A music fan\nAfter the dark, but inconsistent "The Dreaming", Kate Bush moved onto what was truly a tale of a spiritual struggle with the marvellous and mysterious "Hounds Of Love". If "The Dreaming" was obsessed with evil powers 
EXTD=and their workings, "Hounds Of Love" was truly a tale of a woman's spiritual experience. Moreover, Kate Bush never failed to be honest. yet mysterious about the portraits given, especially on the brilliant opener "Running Up That Hill" and the powerf

EXTD=les in childhood, was almost as brilliant, as was the haunting "Mother Stands For Comfort", a reflection on the evil within humanity.\n\nThe second side, known as "The Ninth Wave" was the tale of a drowning woman and her experiences from drowning to 
EXTD=rescue. Logically arranged, the songs on this side manage remarkably well to remain as songs.\n\n"And Dream Of Sheep" possessed a remarkable beauty from the melodic whistles, and the synthesised strings of "Under Ice" possessed great dramatic power. 
EXTD="Watching You Without Me" was perhaps the most mysterious piece of all on an album of Sophianic mystery - one just does not know what is inside Bush's mind in her remote solitude symbolised by this song. "Hello Earth", highlighted by the line "get ou
EXTD=t of the waves, get out of the water", gave an almost apocalyptic tone to the mystiucal story on "The Ninth Wave". This is made even more intense by the use of Gregorian chant by the Richard Hickox Singers between more conventionally structured verse
EXTD=s, though given a beautiful tone by Liam O'Flynn's amazing uillean pipes.\n\nThe last track on the original album, "The Morning Fog" symbolised a return to the world by the drowning woman and was the most accessible piece on the whole record. The bon

EXTD=ning, HOUNDS OF LOVE would seem to have little in common with Kate Bush's previous work - in some ways, however, it is a logical extension, for throughout her earlier work she had increasingly fused unlikely instruments with synthesizers while gradual
EXTD=ly leaving behind certain vocal affectations. For HOUNDS OF LOVE she would repeat this, fusing distinctly Irish-sounding instruments with synthesizers while continuing to downplay her extraordinary range to create a remarkably clean yet multi-layered
EXTD=sound that serves her material remarkably well. At the same time, she worked her penchant for macabre and bizarre imagery into a much more subtle idiom. The resulting HOUNDS OF LOVE seems, to me at least, like a combination of the melodic delicacy o
