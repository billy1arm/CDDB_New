EXTD=ownward spiral and arrested artistic development seemed all the stronger 
EXTD=when compared to Xtina's restless risks and increasingly assured musical 
EXTD=vision, a progression that's evident on Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of

EXTD="Candyman," Keeps Gettin' Better has a narrative momentum: the squeaky-c

EXTD=electro style that suggests a Blackout if Britney were in control and kne
EXTD=w what she was doing, but what is remarkable about the collection is that
EXTD=Christina's past holds up, with the candy-pop of "Genie," "What a Girl W
EXTD=ants," and "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" still sounding sweet, 
EXTD="Beautiful" sounding richly melancholy, and "Ain't No Other Man" and "Can

EXTD=iew\n\n"Some days I'm a super bitch," sings Christina Aguilera on this co
EXTD=llection's title track. It's a brazen, unapologetic line that says a lot 
EXTD=about the singer's attitude. There can't be many 50 million-selling pop d
EXTD=ivas who aren't capable of being a "super bitch" when they want to be - a
EXTD=nd probably when they don't - but Aguilera's the one who's gone out and s
EXTD=aid it.\n\nThis spunky attitude is stamped all over Keeps Gettin' Better,
EXTD=a greatest hits set tracing her career from the coquettish teen-pop of '
EXTD=Genie In A Bottle' to the Goldfrapp stylings of the title track (and rece
EXTD=nt single). She may have started out with similar material to another Mic
EXTD=key Mouse Club alumnus, but Aguilera moved on to bigger and better things
EXTD=more quickly than Britney, co-writing the lion's share of her second alb
EXTD=um, Stripped, and making her third, Back To Basics, a 2-CD pop-soul-jazz-
EXTD=blues opus.\n\nDuring her "decade of hits" she's ricocheted between genre
EXTD=s, wrapping her pipes around everything from strutting arena rock ('Fight
EXTD=er)' to tongue-in-cheek retro-pop ('Candyman') to the sluttiest, sweaties
EXTD=t club banger in recent memory ('Dirrty'). Keeps Gettin' Better should pr
EXTD=obably feel messy and disparate, but actually it hangs together pretty we
EXTD=ll. There are number of constants running through the collection: sex, se
EXTD=lf-empowerment and of course Aguilera's singing, which is rarely subtle b
EXTD=ut never anything less than committed. The way she sings "I never back do
EXTD=wn" on 'Fighter', only a fool would test her.\n\nThe set concludes with f
EXTD=our new tracks that signpost the electropop direction of Aguilera's next 
EXTD=album. 'Dynamite', on which she sings about "dancing 'til the morning lig
EXTD=ht on a velvet sky", and 'Keeps Gettin Better', her current single, sugge
EXTD=st she shouldn't have too much trouble reinventing herself as a robopop d
EXTD=iva. Meanwhile, sultry remakes of 'Genie In A Bottle' and 'Beautiful', th
EXTD=ough hardly essential, work better than they have any right to.\n\nIt isn
EXTD='t quite definitive - what happened to 'Can't Hold Us Down?' - and some o
EXTD=f the ballads stray into X Factor territory, but Keeps Gettin' Better is 
EXTD=a consistently entertaining collection that paints Aguilera as ambitious,
EXTD=adaptable and willing to indulge her taste for the absurd. On this evide
EXTD=nce she's probably earned the right to behave like a "super bitch" - ever
EXTD=y once in a while, at least.
