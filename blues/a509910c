EXTD=a more important label development for the singer/songwriter wast
EXTD=hat his old home Fantasy Records, the place where he cut all his 
EXTD=classic Creedence Clearwater Revival albums, was sold to Concord 
EXTD=Records. He had a longstanding feud with Fantasy and its head,Sau
EXTD=l Zaentz, but Concord sought to make amends with Fogerty, quickly
EXTD=signing him to the label. Just as rapidly, Fogerty finally embra

EXTD=ng a compilation called The Long Road Home, which blended hisCree
EXTD=dence hits with solo cuts, a welcome return for all involved-- so
EXTD=welcome that Fogerty continued to push this re-acceptance of Cre
EXTD=edence on his 2007 follow-up to Deja Vu, Revival. Its very title,
EXTD=of course, echoes CCR -- while its cover echoes Blue RidgeRanger
EXTD=s and his eponymous debut -- and Fogerty goes out of his way to s
EXTD=toke those comparisons by writing "Creedence Song," but it's poss
EXTD=ible to oversell this return to the fold as a massive shiftin sou
EXTD=nd and aesthetic, when it's really an imperceptible change, at le
EXTD=ast in terms of pure sound. Fogerty may have shunned Creedence, b
EXTD=ut that is only in terms of songs: he never ran away fromthe soun
EXTD=d. After all, this is a guy who was sued for plagiarizinghimself 
EXTD=- sure, it was a frivolous suit, but it's a pretty goodindicatio
EXTD=n that his solo work sounded a lot like his classic stuff. So, an
EXTD=ybody expecting Revival to be a big shift in directionwill be dis
EXTD=appointed, because it has a similar feel to any of hisother recor
EXTD=ds, along with a very relaxed vibe, not dissimilar toanything he'
EXTD=s done after Eye of the Zombie. \n\nEven if the acceptance of Cre
EXTD=edence hasn't made much of a difference in terms ofsound, it does
EXTD=have an effect on Fogerty as a writer, as he attempts to recaptu
EXTD=re the vibe of his '60s stuff, tapping into the charged political
EXTD=vibe of "Fortunate Son" and "Who'll Stop the Rain"in particular.
EXTD=Revival spills over with topical songs, both metaphorical ("Guns
EXTD=linger") and thuddingly literal ("Long Dark Night," where George 
EXTD=W., Rummy, and Dick Cheney are all called out by name). Sometimes
EXTD=Fogerty's missives lack grace -- impassioned though it is, the n
EXTD=ame-calling in "Long Dark Night" is clumsy -- butthere's a real f
EXTD=ire to his writing here, turning Revival into a missive as immedi
EXTD=ate, effective, and telling as Neil Young's Living with War. Like
EXTD=that album, it does feel like the work of an oldpro, in how the 
EXTD=music is lived-in and simple. Sometimes, this can veer into somet
EXTD=hing that's just this side of stodgy -- "Don't You Wish It Was Tr
EXTD=ue" sounds like something to be played while swinging on the fron
EXTD=t porch -- and there's a crankiness that runs through this record
EXTD=that's kind of ingratiating. Fogerty is longingfor the past here
EXTD=- crooning like Merle Haggard when he wondered if the good time
EXTD=s were really over -- but this isn't a new wrinkle - Fogerty has a
EXTD=lways been nostalgic. When he was a young man,he romanticized Ame
EXTD=rica's past, creating a world that likely didn't exist, but his v
EXTD=isions were all the more alluring because of their fantasy. Perha
EXTD=ps it was inevitable that as he aged, he'd turn to romanticizing 
EXTD=his own past, yet it's still odd to hear him embracing the "Summe
EXTD=r of Love" when he never, ever was part of thescene in San Franci
EXTD=sco - knowing this, it kind of gives away theartifice behind his c
EXTD=reation. Still, artifice can be a crucial part of art, and Fogert
EXTD=y is an uncannily sharp musician in how he can mold the past to f
EXTD=it his own world, which he does with "Summerof Love," turning it 
EXTD=into a fuzz-toned choogle with a sly paraphrase of "Sunshine of Y
EXTD=our Love." This is also true on "CreedenceSong," which is far fro
EXTD=m self-aggrandizing -- it's wryly funny and crackling with musica
EXTD=l allusions to CCR songs, some so sly theypass by without notice.
EXTD=This is Revival at its most fun, but even if the world-weariness
EXTD=drags down some of the rest of the album, this is nevertheless h
