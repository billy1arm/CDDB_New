EXTD=k Owens broke two traditions: He recorded in Nashville with a gro
EXTD=up of studio musicians, and he recorded for Warner Bros. instead 
EXTD=of Capitol. In 1974, as his Capitol contract--and a long streak o
EXTD=f hits--drew to a close, Owens was thriving thanks to Hee Haw and
EXTD=a number of successful business ventures. But later that year Do
EXTD=n Rich, Owens' friend and collaborator, died in a motorcycle acci

EXTD=gic, Warner's Andy Wickham signed Owens, who decided it was time 
EXTD=for a new approach to record making. Owens, along with producer N
EXTD=orro Wilson, made a sharp turn away from the Bakersfield twang an
EXTD=d toward something Owens, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson had 
EXTD=made careers out of rejecting--country-pop. He was simply keeping
EXTD=an open mind. Owens' first two Warner releases, Buck 'Em and Our
EXTD=Old Mansion, laid out the differences with originals and covers 
EXTD=of songs by The Beatles, the Eagles, and Leo Sayer. Later, in 197

EXTD='t sticking, he reached #11 in with "Play Together Again," a duet
EXTD=with longtime admirer Emmylou Harris. Owens attempted a 1982 alb
EXTD=um for Warner Bros., but never finished it. Those recordings are 
EXTD=available here for the first time, including versions of George J
EXTD=ones' "Season Of My Heart" and Delbert McClinton's "Victim Of Lif

EXTD=rly to mid '80s, Owens went to #1 with "Streets Of Bakersfield," 
EXTD=a duet with Dwight Yoakam. In the late '80s Owens returned to Cap
