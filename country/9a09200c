EXTT0=(Bob Dylan]\nJohn Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor He travelled with a gun in every hand All along this country side he opened many a door But he was never known to hurt an honest man Twas down in Chaney County, a time they talk about With hi
EXTT0=s lady by his side he took a stand And soon the situation there was all but straightened out For he was always known to lend a helping hand All across the telegraph his name it did resound But no charge held against him could be proved And there was
EXTT0=no man around that could track or chain him down He was never known to make a foolish move
EXTT1=(Bob Dylan]\nAs I went out one morning to breathe the air aound Tom Paine's I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm "Part from me this mom
EXTT1=eent." I told her with my voice Said she, "But I don't wish to. " Said I "But you have no choice." "I beg you sir", she pleaded from the corners of her mouth "I will secretly accept you, and together we'll fly south." Just then Tom Paine himself cam
EXTT1=e running from across the field Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield And, as she was letting go her grip of Tom Paine, did run "I'm sorry sir", he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
EXTT2=(Bob Dylan]\nI dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive as you or me Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold "Arise, arise", he 
EXTT2=cried so loud with a voice without restraint "Come out you gifted kings and queens and hear my sad complaint" "No martyr is among ye now whom ye can call your own" "But go on your way accordingly but know you're not alone" I dreamed I saw St. August
EXTT2=ine alive with fiery breath And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death Oh I awoke in anger so alone and terrified I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried
EXTT3=(Bob Dylan]\n"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief, "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief Businessmen they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth None of them along the line know what any of it is worth" "No rea
EXTT3=son to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late" All along the wa
EXTT3=tchtower Princes kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants, too Outside in the distance A wild cat did growl Two riders were approaching The wind began to howl
EXTT4=(Bob Dylan]\nWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends. So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens, And placed them on a foot stool just above the clouded plain. Saying, "Take your pick
EXTT4=, Frankie boy. My loss will be your gain." Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin. But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin. "Could you please not stare at me like that", he said. "It's just my fool
EXTT4=ish pride. For sometimes a man must be alone, and this is no place to hide." Well Judas he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here, But you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear." "I'm goin'
EXTT4=to start my pickin' right now. Just tell me where you'll be." Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity." "Eternity?", said Frankie Lee, with a voice as cold as ice. "That's right," said Judas "Eternity, though you might call it paradise." "I
EXTT4=don't call it anything", said Frankie Lee with a smile. "Alright", said Judas Priest "I'll see you after a while." Well Frankie Lee he sat back down feeling low and mean. When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene. Saying, "Are you Fran
EXTT4=kie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased? For, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road, and they say his name is Priest." "Oh yes, he is my friend", said Frankie Lee in fright. "I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left m
EXTT4=y sight." "Yes that's the one", said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse. "Oh my message is, he's down the road, stranded in a house." Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran Until he came on to the spot where Judas Priest did st
EXTT4=and. "What kind of house is this?", he said "Where I have come to roam." "It's not a house", says Judas Priest, "It's not a house, it's a home." Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control Over everything which he had made while the mis
EXTT4=sion bells did toll. He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun With four and twenty windows and a woman's face in every one. Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful bounding leap. And, foaming at the mouth, he beg
EXTT4=an to make his midnight creep. For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst No one tried to say a thing, when they carried him out, in jest Except, of course, t
EXTT4=he little neighbor boy who carried him to rest And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well concealed And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed." Well the moral of this story, the moral of this song Is simply that one should 
EXTT4=never be where one does not belong. So, when you see your neighbor carrying somethin', help him with his load. And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
EXTT5=(Bob Dylan]\n"Oh, help me in my weakness", I heard the drifter say As they carried him from the court room and were taking him away. "My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time it isn't long And I still do not know what it was that I've done wro
EXTT5=ng." Well, the judge he cast his robe aside a tear came to his eye "You failed to understand", he said. "Why must you even try?" Outside the crowd was stirring, you could hear if from the door Inside the judge was stepping down, while the jury cried
EXTT5=for more. "Oh, stop that, cursed jury", cried the attendant and the nurse "The trial was bad enough, but his is ten times worse," Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape And while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did es
EXTT5=cape.
EXTT6=(Bob Dylan]\nDear landlord, please don't put a price on my soul My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control When that steamboat whistle blows I'm gonna to give you all that I got to give And I do hope you receive it well Depending on the way yo
EXTT6=u feel that you lived. Dear landlord, please heed these words that I speak I know you suffered much, but in this you are not so unique All of us at times, we might work too hard To have it too fast and too much And anyone can fill his live up with t
EXTT6=hings He can see but it just cannot touch. Dear landlord, please don't dismiss my case I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place Now each of us has his own special gift And you know this was meant to be true And if you don't un
EXTT6=der estimate me I won't under estimate you.
EXTT7=(Bob Dylan]\nI am a lonesome hobo Without family or friends. Where another man's life might begin That's exactly where mine ends. I have tried my hand at bribery, Blackmail and deceit. And I've served time for everything 'cept beggin' on the street.
EXTT7=Well, once I was rather prosperous There was nothin' I did lack. I had fourteen caret gold in my mouth And silk upon my back. But I did not trust my brother I carried him to blame. Which led me to my fatal doom To wander off in shame. Kind ladies a
EXTT7=nd kind gentlemen Soon I will be gone. But let me just warn you all Before I do pass on. Stay free from petty jealousies, Live by no man's code. And hold your judgment for yourself Lest you wind up on this road.
EXTT8=(Bob Dylan]\nI pity the poor immigrant Who wishes he would've stayed home Who uses all his power to do evil But in the end is always left so alone That man whom with his fingers cheats And whom lies with every breath Who passionately hates his life 
EXTT8=And likewise fears his death. I pity the poor immigrant Who's strength is spent in vain Who's heaven is like ironsides Who's tears are like rain Who eats but is not satisfied Who hears but does not see Who falls in love with wealth itself And turns 
EXTT8=his back on me. I pity the poor immigrant Who tramples through the mud Who fills his mouth with laughing And who builds his town with blood Who's visions in the final end Must shatter like the glass I pity the poor immigrant When his gladness comes 
EXTT8=to pass
EXTT9=(Bob Dylan]\nThere was a wicked messenger from Eli he did come With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter. When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter. He stayed behind the 
EXTT9=assembly hall it was there he made his bed Often times he could be seen returning. Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand which read The soles of my feet I swear they're burning. For the leaves began to falling and the seas began to 
EXTT9=part And the people that confronted him were many. And he was told with these few words which opened up his heart If you can not bring good news then don't bring any
EXTT10=(Bob Dylan]\nDown along the cove I spied my true love coming my way Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way I said, "Lord have mercy momma, It sure is good to see you comin' today." Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy
EXTT10=Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy She said, "Lord have mercy honey, I'm so glad you're my boy." Down along the cove We walked together hand in hand Down along the cove We walked together hand in hand Everbody watchin' us a go by 
EXTT10=Knows we're in love, yes they understand.
EXTT11=(Bob Dylan]\nClose your eyes, close the door You don't have to worry anymore I'll be your baby tonight Shut the light, shut the shade You don't have to be afraid I'll be your baby tonight Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away We're gonna forget 
EXTT11=it That big fat moon he's gonna shine like a spoon But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it. Kick your shoes off, do not fear Bring that bottle over here I'll be your baby tonight
