EXTD=g's long-delayed, suddenly prodigious Archives series, A Treasure chronicl
EXTD=es Neil's 1984-1985 tour with the International Harvesters, a crackerjack 
EXTD=assemblage of country pros featuring guitarist Ben Keith, pianist Hargus "
EXTD=Pig" Robbins, fiddler Rufus Thibodeaux, and Spooner Oldham. This is one of
EXTD=Young's famous left turns, as he abandoned the tightly wound electro of T
EXTD=rans and the hipster rockabilly of Everybody's Rockin' for a trip back to 
EXTD=the country, cutting Old Ways then hitting the road with the International
EXTD=Harvesters. Old Ways was a little stilted but the same can't be said of A
EXTD=Treasure: this is vivid and alive, pulsating with a palpable joy. Their e
EXTD=nergy boosts the Old Ways material, giving it welcome blood and muscle, bu
EXTD=t A Treasure runs far broader than that one album. Young overhauls two cut
EXTD=s from Re*Ac*Tor, turning "Motor City" and "Southern Pacific" into a honky
EXTD=tonk stomp and a chugging country ballad, respectively, reworks Buffalo S
EXTD=pringfield's "Flying on the Ground Is Wrong," covers Joe London's country 
EXTD=chestnut "It Might Have Been" and, most significantly for the hardcore, th
EXTD=ere are five unreleased Young originals here: a sweetly rambling ode to hi
EXTD=s daughter "Amber Jean," an excellent slice of Texan honky tonk with "Let 
EXTD=Your Fingers Do the Walking," the rowdy barroom blues of "Soul of a Woman,
EXTD=" the working man protest of "Nothing Is Perfect," and Crazy Horse stomp "
EXTD=Grey Riders." The unheard tunes are all first-rate, but what's really nota
EXTD=ble about A Treasure is that it offers a compelling document of how good t
EXTD=he International Harvesters were and, in turn, makes sense of a somewhat m
EXTD=urky period for Neil Young.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Ed
EXTD=itorial Review\nThe 12-track live album, A Treasure includes songs - 5 of 
EXTD=which are previously unreleased - recorded during Young's 1984 and 1985 U.
EXTD=S. tours without the support of an album, or Young's then record label due
EXTD=to unique and unusual circumstances. Among those, "Grey Riders" will be t
EXTD=he first track serviced to radio. A Treasure features Young's onstage work
EXTD=with some of the greatest artists in the history of Country music, includ
EXTD=ing the late, great Ben Keith on steel and slide guitar and Rufus Thibodea
EXTD=ux on fiddle, along with living legends Spooner Oldham and Hargus "Pig" Ro
EXTD=bbins on piano, Tim Drummond and Joe Allen on bass, Anthony Crawford on ma
EXTD=ndolin and guitars and Karl Himmel on drums, among many others. A Treasure i
EXTD=s Young's first release since last year's Grammy and Juno Award-winning al
EXTD=bum, Le Noise. The live album captures this iconic artist during a fascina
EXTD=ting time in his career, when he was facing criticism and lawsuits from hi
EXTD=s then current record company for exploring a more traditionally country s
EXTD=ound. "You can call me erratic," Young said when asked at the time about h
EXTD=is tendency toward musical shape-shifting, "but I've been consistent about
EXTD=it, consistently erratic." Always celebrated for his musical versatility,
EXTD=A Treasure, is akin to a sonic time capsule, instantly transporting the l
EXTD=istener to the time and place when it was made. "I love this record," Youn
EXTD=g says. "I hadn't heard these takes in 25 years, but when we unearthed the
EXTD=m co-producer Ben Keith said, 'This is a treasure.'"\n\nPart of what makes
EXTD=A Treasure so compelling is the musical contributions of The Internationa
EXTD=l Harvesters, with whom Young was playing at the time. Many of them were a
EXTD=lready paragons within the country music world and their notoriety has onl
EXTD=y grown in the years since. "I just love to hear those guys," Young says. 
EXTD="They're all country music legends." Those behind the scenes also made sig
EXTD=nificant contributions to A Treasure's sonic potency. Tim Mulligan mixed a
EXTD=nd mastered the tracks. At the time these songs were recorded, Bob Sterne 
EXTD=was the tour manager, Tim Foster ran the stage, and Larry Cragg was in cha
EXTD=rge of the band's instruments. \n\nA Treasure will be released in several 
EXTD=formats, including standard CD, vinyl (180gm and 140gm), digital download 
EXTD=with and without videos, and as a deluxe CD/Blu-ray package. The Blu-ray v
EXTD=ersion will feature a curated selection of video that lends context and im
EXTD=agistic power to the tracks. "I like to look at these old live videos and 
EXTD=listen to what I think are the best versions of these songs," Young says. 
EXTD="It's fun to see what we looked like when we were playing it then."\n\n
