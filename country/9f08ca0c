EXTD=The songs are intimate blues, most taken at the pace of a late-

EXTD=oll," summoning some honest grit for the former and putting the u
EXTD=ptown swing into the latter. He also allows some solo space, from
EXTD=Barney Kessel's simple, unadorned solo on "Get Yourself Another

EXTD=ing\nThe title implies a party record, but much of this bluesiest
EXTD=of Sam Cooke albums is downbeat stuff, as the master adapts the 
EXTD=gospel standard "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," shakes his

EXTD=and "I Lost Everything." By the grace of his voice, a thousand i

EXTD=Beat This!\n\nAnother soul-stirring effort by the great Sam Cook
EXTD=e, "Night Beat" is one of the best vocal soul/blues/rock/gospel a

EXTD=' sideman Billy Preston on keyboards). The opener is almost a cap

EXTD=ld" is masterfully phrased, and I daresay that Rod Stewart may ha

EXTD=t he is the master of all genres. Somehow he manages to save "Lit
