EXTD=Released September 1988\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Haggard appears he

EXTD=no reason to dismiss this record, however, as crisis introspecti

EXTD=Digitally remastered by Glenn Meadows and Milan Bogdan.\n\nMerle 
EXTD=Haggard's music is great for many reasons. One is Haggard's voice
EXTD=, among the most expressive and beautiful in all of country music
EXTD=Another is his insistence on working only with top musicians wh
EXTD=ose assets include an understanding of many traditional country s
EXTD=tyles, including folk, blues, and Western swing. Most important, 
EXTD=though, is Haggard's ability to give voice to the quiet despair o
EXTD=f those too romantic to give up hope but too cynical to believe t
EXTD=hose hopes could ever amount to anything but heartbreak.\n\nThis 
EXTD=last ability is particularly apparent on Haggard's SERVING 190 PR
EXTD=OOF. Whether bemoaning the grind and loneliness of life on the ro
EXTD=ad ("Footlights"), describing a doomed relationship ("Got Lonely 
EXTD=Too Early This Morning," "Driftwood," "Red Bandana"), or turning 
EXTD=to the bottle for solace ("Heaven Was A Drink Of Wine"), Haggard 
EXTD=expresses a longing for a serenity he knows he'll never have. As 
EXTD=he makes clear in the deceptively upbeat "My Own Kind Of Hat," Ha
EXTD=ggard understands perfectly well where he doesn't fit in - he just
EXTD=can't find a place he belongs. All that separates Haggard from h
EXTD=is audience, he seems to be saying, is his ability to transform h
EXTD=is melancholy into art.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nLittle-k
EXTD=nown, but one of his best, September 24, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\n
EXTD=This album was Merle Haggard's self-proclaimed "therapy" album, a
EXTD=kind of extended meditation about being (at the time) 41 years o
EXTD=ld and not sure about wanting to continue the life of a musician.
EXTD=The opener, "Footlights," lays out that gloomy dilemma right fro
EXTD=m the start - he croons the self-mocking lines "Tonight I'll kick 
EXTD=the footlights out again/And try and hide the mood I'm really in/
EXTD=And flash on my ol' instamatic grin/Yes, tonight I'll kick the fo
EXTD=otlights out again" with the air of a guy who knows that those tw
EXTD=o hours up onstage aren't going to cure his blues, but what else 
EXTD=is there to do? "Got Lonely Too Early This Morning," "I Can't Get
EXTD=Away," and many of the others continue in the same vein. It woul
EXTD=d all be bathetic if the playing and singing on this album weren'
EXTD=t some of the best Haggard and The Strangers (and others) have ev
EXTD=er done---and if the songs weren't some of Haggard's best. The mo
EXTD=od clears at the end with the lovely "Roses In The Winter," but i
EXTD=t's a stormy road getting there all the same. Worth it, anyway - i
EXTD=f you like Merle Haggard, this is one you should get. \n\n\nAMAZO

EXTD=tty bad for me, but just listening to this music and these words 
EXTD=hit the spot. \n\nIn justice to Haggard, this music was recorded 
EXTD=more than 22 years ago. Some of the players in the great touring

EXTD=didn't mean to love you." \n\nWhat really hits one, even though 
EXTD=I am delighted by Hag's singing and Bonnie's backups, and the who
EXTD=le band, is these songs. The quality of these songs and the way t
EXTD=hey speak to mature life, and not soap opera bulb gum triteness, 
EXTD=is remarkable. These songs really are adaptable across genre. Thi
EXTD=s album should be appreciated not only by Hag fans. CW, Folk, and

EXTD=this album and he uses that instrument very well here. This recor

EXTD=different sound and different topics. The whole album fits toget

EXTD=M CUSTOMER REVIEW\nJust doesn't get any better, November 17, 2002
EXTD=\nBy  Jazzy Jake "jazzyjake" (Severna Park, Maryland United Stat
EXTD=es]\n\nThis album has a permanent place in my "desert island disk
EXTD=s". A top candidate for the best country album of all time. With 
EXTD=the exception of the mawkish "Sing A Family Song", it is one grea
EXTD=t song after another. Hag delivers each song with acuity and make
EXTD=s you a believer. \n\nThe band is tight and contributes plenty in
EXTD=teresting moments. I've always admired Hag for stepping outside t
EXTD=he confines of traditional country arrangements (adding horns for
EXTD=example) and having the wisdom of assembling great players and l
EXTD=etting them play.\n\nBookmarked by perfect, melancholy songs, "Fo
EXTD=otlights" and "Roses In the Winter", my favorites also have to in
EXTD=clude "Driftwood", for its great flat picking, and "Heaven Was A 
EXTD=Drink of Wine", for its witty pathos.\n\nThis album showcases Hag
EXTD=at his best and it just doesn't get any better. It belongs in ev
EXTD=eryone's CD cabinet. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nOne of Mer
EXTD=le's Best, August 6, 2001 \nBy  Michael Carley (San Joaquin Valle
EXTD=y, CA]\n\nI have reviewed several Haggard CDs (click on my name t
EXTD=o see the others) and most get high marks, but this one is probab
EXTD=ly my personal favorite. The Strangers were at the height of thei
EXTD=r powers and the songwriting is some of Hag's best. Footlights is
EXTD=a musician's song. It has been described well in a prior review 
EXTD=and is popular among most of those who've heard it. "Red Bandana"
EXTD=is a great song about ex-wife Bonnie Owens, who still travels wi
EXTD=th him. It has one of the great references in country songwriting
EXTD=, "You ain't never gonna be no Bobby McGee, but you're tryin' to"
EXTD="My Own Kind of Hat" is a fan favorite. The lyrics ("Cowboys an
EXTD=d Outlaws, right guys and southpaws...") take a playful swipe at 
EXTD=the then popular Outlaw movement in country music. The guitar wor
EXTD=k of these two songs in particular is some of the best of Hag's c
EXTD=areer. "Roses in the Winter" is one of Hag's least known ballads,
EXTD=and one of my favorites. If you like "Sing a Family Song", you m
EXTD=ay also like Hag's most recent album "If I Could Only Fly". Sever
EXTD=al songs on that CD are in the same vein. Those songs are just so
EXTD=me of the more notable. Truthfully, there isn't a bad track on th
EXTD=is CD. If you like Hag's music, this is one of the best available
