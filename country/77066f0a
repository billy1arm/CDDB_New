EXTD=REVIEW: When Waylon Jennings hooked up with songwriter Billy Joe 
EXTD=Shaver, he found the perfect author for his obsessions, his fasci
EXTD=nations, and his very image. Waylon had always been looking, perh
EXTD=aps unintentionally, for a common ground between country and rock
EXTD=, and Shaver's songs -- sketching an outlaw stance with near defi
EXTD=ance and borrowing rock attitude to create the hardest country tu
EXTD=nes imaginable -- were perfect. On his previous album, Waylon had
EXTD=sung that "ladies love outlaws," but now he found the music that
EXTD=would soon be called outlaw country, a defiant, ballsy blend of 
EXTD=mythmaking and truth-telling. Shaver never had a better voice for
EXTD=his songs, and Jennings never had better songs for his style. Ho
EXTD=nky Tonk Heroes arrived at a crucial moment, a time when true hon
EXTD=ky tonk was fading, so only a dose of rock and roll could save it. 
EXTD=And, no matter how much rock attitude is here, this is pure count
EXTD=ry in its stance and attitude -- yet Honky Tonk Heroes' very defi
EXTD=ance makes it a perfect discovery album for listeners who never t
EXTD=hought they would like country music. And the songs! Shaver earne
EXTD=d his stripes here, with songs that were emotional, funny, and cl
EXTD=ever, utterly bringing the mythic outlaw ethic to life. "Black Ro
EXTD=se," "You Asked Me To," and "Honky Tonk Heroes" remain among the 
EXTD=greatest things Waylon ever cut, and every other song here matche
EXTD=s them. Few country albums have ever been this consistent, and fe
EXTD=w records, from any genre, have been as consistently compelling.

EXTD=s Honky Tonk Heroes was the defining record of the anti-Nashville
EXTD=Outlaw movement--the term came after the album--and a cornerston
EXTD=e in country music history. Featuring bare-bones production and p
EXTD=lainspoken, hard-nosed lyrics that celebrated personal freedoms a

EXTD=y knows the story about how an unknown songwriter named Billy Joe
EXTD=Shaver talked the semi-famous singer Waylon Jennings into record
EXTD=ing his songs. The result was the first "outlaw" country album. \n
EXTD=Record producers seem to think the last person who should be cons
EXTD=ulted on their music is the musician. Waylon, who was lonesome, o
EXTD=n'ry, and mean, bucked the system and determined that he was goin
EXTD=g to make music his way. "Honky Tonk Heros" was the result, a rou
EXTD=gh-edged collection of simple songs and spare arrangements. Acous
EXTD=tic guitar and harmonica lead the instruments on most tracks. \n\n
EXTD="Honky Tonk Heroes" won't sound all that revolutionary to the mod
EXTD=ern listener, but it's still good -- and I would buy this CD for 
EXTD=the legends that surround it. All the songs on "Honky Tonk Heroes
EXTD=" are good - probably none belong in the top ten list of Waylon's 
EXTD=best. My favorite is "Omaha" which has one of those melodies that
EXTD=stick in your head for days on end. \n\nWaylon's gone now - I don
EXTD='t think Billy Joe ever made any money although he's now an elder
EXTD=statesman accepting homage from callers at his trailer house in 
EXTD=Austin. (I don't know whether or not he lives in a trailer house.
EXTD=I just made that up cause it sounds like it should be true.]\n\n

EXTD=rded at the very heart of all that Jennings was rebelling against
EXTD=musically: RCA's "Nashville Sound" studio. That it sounds absolu
EXTD=tely nothing like the prevailing Nashville pop is a tribute to Je
EXTD=nnings, his co-producer (Tompall Glaser), his band (The Waylors),
EXTD=his songwriter for this album (Billy Joe Shaver), and the sympat
EXTD=hetic players Jennings brought in for the sessions. A further sur
EXTD=prise is the lengthy list of musicians, given the relative sparen

EXTD=ennings promising Shaver he'd record his songs is true, it's clea
EXTD=r that no other songwriter of the day so vividly captured the sin
EXTD=ger's ethos. The songs combine outlaw rebellion, mythical storyte
EXTD=lling, and a sense of all-out relief at being able to finally say
EXTD=what's on one's mind. Its sentiments, couched in minimal arrange
EXTD=ments, remain as salty and vibrant as the day they were recorded.
EXTD=\n\nBuddha's reissue adds two bonus tracks to the original ten: S
EXTD=haver's "Slow Rollin' Low" and the single version of Shaver and Jen

EXTD=s, Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThis is the quintessential "Outlaw co
EXTD=untry" album. Waylon Jennings spent the early '70s working his wa
EXTD=y up to this rough-and-tumble masterpiece, arguably the finest al
EXTD=bum of his prolific career. Jennings was so taken with the songwr
EXTD=iting of Nashville rowdy Billy Joe Shaver that he decided to reco
EXTD=rd this all-Shaver album (with the exception of the Fritts/Seals-
EXTD=penned "You Asked Me To"), which helped put Shaver on the map as 
EXTD=the poet laureate of the Outlaw set.\nJennings eschewed the lush 
EXTD=countrypolitan sound in favor of a raw, electrified approach that
EXTD=owed more to the Rolling Stones than to Billy Sherrill. With a s
EXTD=mall band and simple arrangements, he introduced contemporary roc
EXTD=k-oriented beats into his hard-hitting country sound, adding some
EXTD=funky grit to Shaver's common-man poetics on tunes about the tou
EXTD=gher side of life. HONKY TONK HEROES inspired a subsequent genera
EXTD=tion of country iconoclasts, as well as spurring on Jennings's co
EXTD=ntemporaries like Willie Nelson and Tompall Glaser. It stands as
