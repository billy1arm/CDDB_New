EXTD=s devoted an entire album to bluegrass in the early 1970s, the re
EXTD=sults were certainly pleasant and competent, though they weren't 
EXTD=in the top rank of recordings by Owens, or a match for the best s
EXTD=ounds in the bluegrass genre. That's just because Owens' chief st
EXTD=rength was the Bakersfield honky tonk he helped pioneer, not more
EXTD=traditional bluegrass, even if that style was undoubtedly an inf
EXTD=luence on his music. Still, the album was pretty successful, maki

EXTD=d new member Ron Jackson was prominent in the mix on five-string 
EXTD=banjo. With the rhythm section and accomplished harmonies, some t
EXTD=racks, like "Uncle Pen" and "Ole Slew Foot," didn't sound too far
EXTD=removed from the Dillards in their country-rock phase, though it

EXTD=\nSomething Different - Buck and his Bluegrass Buckaroos, September
EXTD=3, 2006\nBy Paul W. Dennis (Winter Springs, FL USA]\n\nGive Buck
EXTD=Owens credit - he knew that the "freight train " sound was growi
EXTD=ng a bit stale and he was willing to experiment. I'VE GOT YOU ON 
EXTD=MY MIND AGAIN was the first album to feature background voices an
EXTD=d strings, something he continued on the next studio album TALL D
EXTD=ARK STRANGER (both 1969). In 1971 Owens took a more contemporary 
EXTD=turn with his BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER album, which was recorde
EXTD=d without fiddle or steel guitar and featured songs by the likes 
EXTD=of Paul Simon and Donovan. Later in 1971 came RUBY AND OTHER BLUE
EXTD=GRASS SPECIALS \n\nNot exactly bluegrass in it's instrumentation 
EXTD=(marred by drums and organ) it nevertheless is a fun romp through
EXTD=eight bluegrass classics plus two from the Buck Owens catalogue 
EXTD=recast as bluegrass. Both singles issued from the album, "Rollin'
EXTD=In My Sweet Baby's Arms" and "Ruby (Honey Are You Mad At Your Ma
EXTD=n)" went to #1 on the more sales-oriented Cashbox charts (Billboa
EXTD=rd had them at #2 and #3 respectively). The title cut was a hit t
EXTD=he year before for the Osborne Brothers, so it was still fresh in
EXTD=the public memory as was "Rocky Top" the Osborne Brthers big hit
EXTD=from 1968. "Ole Slew Foot" was part of both the country and blue
EXTD=grass repertoire and so was familiar to fans of both genres altho
EXTD=ugh the only hit on the song was by Porter Wagoner. "I Know You'r
EXTD=e Married But I Love You Still" was one of the most requested tun
EXTD=es for the beloved bluegrass duo of Don Reno and Red Smiley. Of cou
EXTD=rse, everyone knows "Uncle Pen". \n\nOwens didn't stray too far f
EXTD=rom bluegrass with his next album TOO OLD TO CUT THE MUSTARD, wit
EXTD=h son Buddy Alan. but Owens never again returned to the genre aft
EXTD=er that. Good clean fun - equal emphasis on all three words \n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nBuck Owens Bluegrass (!?!?!?), March 
EXTD=14, 2009\nBy Joe Finnell (Cleveland, TN USA]\n\nWhile primarily a
EXTD=country artist, Buck established his "roots cred" way back in 19
EXTD=72 with this compilation of bluegrass standards and a couple of n
EXTD=ewly penned 'grass songs by him and his son, Buddy Alan. "Corn Li
EXTD=quor", the song composed by Buddy, could easily be mistaken for a
EXTD=n old standard as it is so true to the genre in style and present
EXTD=ation. \n\nWhen a friend of mine played this album for me, him ha
EXTD=ving purchased it back when it first came out, I was delightedly 
EXTD=shocked and amazed. I was unaware that Buck ever did any bluegras
EXTD=s renderings with the exception of his occasional foray into a 'g
EXTD=rass number on "Hee Haw". Whether you're a bluegrass afficionado 
EXTD=or a Buck Owens fan or both, this is a must have for your collect
EXTD=ion. If you're neither, this is the album that could change your 
EXTD=mind. \n\nBuck's high tenor lends itself to the style so masterfu
EXTD=lly and the arrangements are some of the best of any I have heard
EXTD=for each song. Add to that Don Rich's (et. al.) harmony and his 
EXTD=superb fiddling (yes, Don played an excellent fiddle long before 
EXTD=he played that twangy Fender) and this album is on par with any f
EXTD=ulltime bluegrass artists' offerings out there. Jackson's banjo p
EXTD=icking is hard-driving, Scruggs-style icing on the cake. \n\n"I K
EXTD=now You're Married..." is just one example of how he took a great
EXTD=song and made it even better. Reno/Smiley's (composers) version,
EXTD=and all the other covers I have heard, come nowhere near the sou
EXTD=lfulness of Owens'. And every other cut, all the ones you've hear
EXTD=d done over and over, are given a new, more vibrant twist under t
EXTD=he skillful hand of Buck. They have drums, so purists beware. But
EXTD=that in no way detracts from the mastery and genius and talent t
EXTD=hat will never be equalled in the Owens/Rich tag-team on "Ruby".\n

EXTD=uckaroos twist, December 26, 2004\nBy hyperbolium (Earth, USA]\n\n
EXTD=Hot on the heels of Owens' "Bridge Over Troubled Water" release, 
EXTD=the Bakersfield superstar took another unusual turn, dropping the
EXTD=twangy telecasters and shuffle beats in favor of ten electrified
EXTD=bluegrass tunes. Producing himself at his own Bakersfield studio
EXTD=, Owens launched into a collection of both classic and obscure co
EXTD=vers, with two originals (one by Owens, one by his son Buddy Alan
EXTD=) to fill out the short ten track songlist. \n\nThe addition of b
EXTD=anjo player Ron Jackson provided an acoustic touchstone for the B
EXTD=uckaroos to play bluegrass, but this is still bluegrass ala Baker
EXTD=sfield. In particular, there are plenty of drums and Jim Shaw's p
EXTD=iano and organ figure strongly into several tracks. The harmonies
EXTD=of Owens and Don Rich fit these songs nicely, even if they don't
EXTD=break into the traditional bluegrass roles. \n\nThe album's two 
EXTD=singles, "Ruby (Are You Mad)" and "Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arm
EXTD=s" are both winners, and album tracks "I Know You're Married But 
EXTD=I Love You Still" (known best in its 1966 incarnation by Bill And
EXTD=erson and Jan Howard), "Rocky Top," and Johnnie and Jack's "Ashes
EXTD=of Love" are all fine spins. This isn't Owens' strongest outings
EXTD=, but it shows off how fluidly he and the Buckaroos could play to
EXTD=their varied influences.
