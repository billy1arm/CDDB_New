EXTD=classic Christmas album. First released in 1962, it still sounds 
EXTD=great today.   -- David A. Milberg\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Revi
EXTD=ew\nEddy Arnold's rich, mellifluous baritone and butter-smooth de
EXTD=livery made him one of the few singers able to cross effortlessly
EXTD=between pop and country during the 1950s and 1960s--and that ver
EXTD=satility means this collection has something for everyone. Origin
EXTD=ally released in 1961, the album sees Eddy put his stamp on tradi
EXTD=tional religious carols like "O Little Town of Bethlehem," as wel
EXTD=l as spry secular seasonal songs such as "Jingle Bell Rock" and "
EXTD=Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town." And since he never forgot his roo
EXTD=ts in rural Tennessee, he puts a special spin on the touching "Wi
EXTD=ll Santa Come to Shanty Town?" They just don't make them like Edd
EXTD=y Arnold anymore--and that's a cryin' shame. --David Sprague \n\n

EXTD=stomer\n\nLike most of the reviewers, this was among several Chri
EXTD=stmas records that we listened to when the season began just afte
EXTD=r Thanksgiving. We had music from R. Conniff, P. Faith, B. Kaempf
EXTD=ert, A. Williams, D. Martin, A. Fiedler and more. However, my mot
EXTD=her was particular fond of E. Arnold music and this album probabl
EXTD=y received the most air time. As she passed away a few years back
EXTD=, I have been collecting the holiday recordings that we listened 
EXTD=to in CD form. Christmas was her favorite time of the year, and a
EXTD=s I listen to the music that I have collected, it surely brings b
EXTD=ack the good memories my family had during the holiday's. This is
EXTD=the only recording I have yet to find and hope that someday we c
EXTD=an see this in release so that all who are searching for it will 
EXTD=be able to bring back their particular holiday memories with this
EXTD=music. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nWow! Wonderful Old Styl
EXTD=ed Christmas/Countryish Album, January 12, 2009 \nBy  rodney wilt
EXTD=in "christmas man" (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada]\n\nThis really surpr
EXTD=ised me. Why? Because my usual liking for christmas albums are th
EXTD=e easy-listening ones with an orchestra and 'crooner' singer and/
EXTD=or a chorus led album. There are only a very limited few that are
EXTD=n't in this easy-listening/crooner style that I like as much as t
EXTD=his favorite style of mine. And this christmas album by EDDY ARNO
EXTD=LD is one of them. In fact, it is the 'one' in this style and so 
EXTD=much so, I'm ranking it as an almost christmas 'classic/masterpei
EXTD=ce' and almost as great as my favorites of all-time. The only wea
EXTD=kness would be song #2, WILL SANTY COME TO SHANTY TOWN. While it 
EXTD=offers a glimmer of hope/happiness, it also has a touch of sadnes
EXTD=s that would be better suited for a movie/TV special rather than 
EXTD=a song (although most people like this song and I do too, it does
EXTD=n't ruin the album or anything like that but isn't as strong as t
EXTD=he others tracks, IMO, of course). \n\nThe style is old-styled co
EXTD=untry with christmas touches to it. A nice organ is present in so
EXTD=me songs and the backing (mostly male) chorus works perfectly to 
EXTD=create that old country/christmas sound that only BOBBY HELMS and
EXTD=one or two others could manage (to my liking anyway), though thi
EXTD=s is also different than BOBBY HELMS as I would say this is alot 
EXTD=smoother. In fact, I even like this more than BOBBY HELM'S great 
EXTD=christmas record from decades ago. And let's not leave out EDDY a
EXTD=s his voice is countryish, but I can also find a strong 'crooner'
EXTD=influence as well (crooners being PERRY COMO, BING CROSBY, FRANK
EXTD=SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN, etc...). \n\nThe sound on this cd of the a
EXTD=lbum is pristine, very clear but still keeping to that old 1950's
EXTD=/1960's countryish/christmas style. \n\nThis is a definite christ
EXTD=mas classic (with the exception of that one song listed above) as
EXTD=every song is great including a nice new song called CHRISTMAS C
EXTD=AN'T BE FAR AWAY. Every song (with the exception of the first 2) 
EXTD=are mostly/all popular christmas songs that everybody might know 
EXTD=and EDDY gives them all a fantastic treatment, some that are easi
EXTD=ly up there with the best version which includes JINGLE BELL ROCK
EXTD=, IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, and UP ON THE HOUSETOP. Eddy's v
EXTD=oice is so awesome and worth noting is the backing male chorus wh
EXTD=ich is also fantastic in these songs as is the backing music. \n\n
EXTD=Again, this is one of those rare, non easy-listening/crooner chri
EXTD=stmas albums that I like almost as much as my favorite easy-liste
EXTD=ning/crooner christmas albums. It's pretty much a classic christm
EXTD=as record with a beautiful old-time christmas feel to it. Very, v
EXTD=ery recommended. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nPure Christmas
EXTD=Delight, December 29, 2007 \nBy  Stephen L. Smith (Greensboro, A
EXTD=labama USA]\n\nEddy Arnold brings his warm and straightforward st
EXTD=yle to Christmas with this Christmas album. Eddy Arnold brings hi
EXTD=s warm smooth way with a song to the Christmas music. His voice w
EXTD=as in its prime here. This is nothing fancy, which is what I like
EXTD=for Christmas music. He sings them simply and meaningfully. For 
EXTD=me, this is the way Christmas music should be. It's a little old 
EXTD=fashioned, but I love it. This is the CD I play the most at Chris
EXTD=tmas time. Eddy truly puts the meaning in Christmas with this goo
EXTD=d music and his warm way with a song.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\nThis was a huge part of every Christmas during my childhood
EXTD=, April 20, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\nOut of every 10 Christmas alb
EXTD=ums we would play at our house while I was growing up, nine of th
EXTD=e 10 would be this album. When we would get to the end of side tw
EXTD=o, we would merely turn over the album, and play it over again. I
EXTD=t just seemed to be the right, the best, the most Christmas-like 
EXTD=thing to do. Growing up a farmer's son, my Dad listened to a lot 
EXTD=of country, which of course included the legend, Eddy Arnold. He 
EXTD=always had, and always will have, such a relaxed way with a song.
EXTD=He captured the essence of the songs on this album perfectly. My
EXTD=two particular favorites are 'Christmas Can't be Far Away' and W
EXTD=ill Santy Come to Shanty Town?'. When I started out on my own, I 
EXTD=made sure the first Christmas music I owned was a cassette tape o
EXTD=f this album. Now that I have my own family, I want to continue t
EXTD=his wonderful Christmas tradition with my children. My cassette i
EXTD=s wearing out, so I'm going to find this album on CD, sooner or l
EXTD=ater. I wish I could tell Mr. Arnold how much his album was a par
EXTD=t of Christmasses in the Walsh household, then and now.
