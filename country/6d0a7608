EXTD=VH1 Storytellers: David Bowie [CD+DVD]\n© 2009V Virgin Records America/EMI Records Ltd.\n\nOriginally Released July 14, 2009\nOriginally Recorded August 23, 1999\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  VH1's sadly short-lived series Storytellers was ideal for an old 
EXTD=charmer like David Bowie, giving him an intimate platform to spin stories both old and new. When he appeared on the show on August 23, 1999, he was a few months away from releasing Hours..., an album where he comfortably came to terms with his past, 
EXTD=so it fits that he's looking back fondly here, telling stories about the Mannish Boys and Iggy Pop, sliding the new tunes "Thursday's Child" and "Seven" in between "Life on Mars?" and "Drive-In Saturday," plus "Can't Help Thinking About Me," a single
EXTD=he released with the Lower Third in 1965. These are all good, relaxed, unplugged readings, but the chief attraction of VH1 Storytellers is, appropriately enough, those stories Bowie tells, as they not only offer a glimpse into the creation of these 
EXTD=songs, they do what great stories should do: they entertain. [VH1 Storytellers is available as a CD/DVD package, with the CD containing a mere eight songs and the DVD containing a full program of 12 tunes, adding "Always Crashing in the Same Car" and
EXTD=Tin Machine's "I Can't Read" into the mix.]   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description\nCD/DVD edition of this release which features David Bowie's 1999 appearance on VH1's hugely popular Storytellers series. Storytellers began

EXTD=ty" cd. In the meantime, he's popped up now and again as a guest (most notably, for me, at least, on the television show "Extras") and has released live material, like the Glass Spider dvd. I'd prefer a new album, but at least we're getting some grea
EXTD=t stuff here. \n\nAround the time "hours..." came out, David Bowie appeared on the excellent VH1 Storytellers program. This was undoubtedly one of, if not the, best Storyteller show of the series' run. Bowie, perhaps more than any other artist, is pe
EXTD=rfectly suited to this kind of environment, and he shines here. \n\nI do wish one of my all-time favorites "Always Crashing in the Same Car" had been included on the cd as well as the dvd, but such is the limitation of the cd format. \n\nThis is not 
EXTD=an essential addition to the Bowie catalog, but it's a welcome one for us product-starved Bowie fanatics. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n3.5 stars... VH1 Storytellers Bowie episode brought to DVD/CD, July 26, 2009 \nBy  Paul Allaer (Cincinnati]\n
EXTD=\nStorytelling: 5 stars - DVD: 3.5 stars - CD: 2 stars \n\nVH1 Storytellers was the TV music channel's perhaps greatest critical (if not commercial) success, and it was quite the coup for them to be able to get someone the stature of David Bowie to do 
EXTD=an episode. THis was taped in New York in 1999. \n\nThe "David Bowie VH1 Storytellers" DVD (64 min.) first brings the 45 min. original episode, exactly as it was broadcast (sans the commercials, of course), and it is in the storytelling that Bowie re
EXTD=ally shines. Here he talks about first meeting and befriending Mark Bolan (of T. Rex) in the early 60s before either of them had achieved any notoriety. There he talks about being depressed that Mott the Hoople, for whom he already wrote "All the You
EXTD=ng Dudes" now rejected a new song of his so he had no choice but to record it himself ("Drive-in Saturday"). There he brings a story of roadies and hangers-on, and on and on. The music is not quite as good, although certainly not bad. The stripped do
EXTD=wn "Life on Mars?" is astonishing. The new tracks (from the about to be released "hours" album) are not quiet as good. The episode closer "Word on a Wing" is equally haunting and sad. The DVD also brings 4 additional bonus songs (19 min.) taped witho
EXTD=ut any storytelling, perhaps performed by the band as a warm up for the crowd (amusingly you can see Bowie smoking a cigarette while singing "If I'm Dreaming My Life", probably violating all kinds of New York laws all the while). I have to admit that
EXTD=the whole thing looks/feels quite dated. This was taped 10 years ago (and no rhyme or reason why it was never released until now). Furthermore, at a mere 64 min., this feels a bit scant for a DVD. Didn't they have any other related bonus materials, 
EXTD=either to put the 1999 episode into context, or about Bowie and the pending 'hours' album? How about a commentary from the producers and/or Bowie on the logistics of putting this together? \n\nThe CD "David Bowie VH1 Storytelling" (8 tracks - 45 min.)
EXTD=brings only the actual VH1 episode, sans the commercials again, and more imcomprehensibly, also sans the 4 bonus tracks. Why? Doesn't therecord label realize that a CD's capacity is 80 minutes? \n\nIn all, this an okay release, and Bowie's story-tel
EXTD=ling is superb, but it could have been a whole lot better with a little more effort besides just transferring a TV episode onto DVD. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGet the DVD rather than just downloading mp3s, July 31, 2009 \nBy  Phil (San Diego,
EXTD=CA) (San Diego, CA]\n\nBowie's storytelling and charisma are the strongest elements of this performance. Quite welcome too, because Bowie's concert performances always tended to be light on stage patter. Bowie is in turn charming, funny, reminiscing
EXTD=, reflective. There's not particularly a continuity throughout the narratives, no chronological or thematic approach, but the performance is engaging. \n\nThe audio CD is enjoyable enough but the stories and asides are more understandable when you're
EXTD=watching the DVD. Which explains why this is the first music purchase I've made in a year where I actually bought the physical media instead of just downloading the songs. \n\nThe setlist provides interesting choices but it does lend itself toward t
EXTD=he stereotype that an artist's music gets slower and quieter as one grows beyond the relentless energy of youth. Of the eight songs, two are from the album Bowie was then promoting, 1999's 'hours...', and two of the four bonus performances (DVD only)
EXTD=are from that album as well. \n\nOf the remaining eight songs, two are hits that even nonfans would recognize, but "Rebel Rebel" is more of a minute long vamp rather than a full performance of the song. The other selections range from surprising (a 
EXTD=lively pounding out of an early-early Bowie song from 1965) to "I can't believe he's doing this song!" ("Drive-In Saturday" from Aladdin Sane) to sublime (the set closer "Word On A Wing" from Station to Station). Pianist Mike Garson especially shines
EXTD=on opener "Life On Mars?" \n\nOf the four bonus performances on the DVD, the highlight is easily "Always Crashing In The Same Car" from Low. It's a bit odd to see Bowie deliver this tribute to melancholy with such a chipper delivery, but nevertheles
EXTD=s it makes you wish that it had been featured as part of the main program. \n\nWith live DVDs on the market of Bowie's 1972, 1983, 1987 and 2003 tours, this new release earns its place in one's Bowie's collection by including strong catalog numbers o
EXTD=therwise neglected by those concert setlists. Hopefully the live year 2000 performance bundled as a bonus with the "Bowie at the Beeb" will be next in line for DVD release. \n\nOne weakness to the end product - Bowie's narratives should have been mix
EXTD=ed louder because you'll probably find yourself using the remote throughout to boost the audio when Bowie speaks, then lower the audio again when the music starts. \n\nIf the premise of the "storytellers" approach appeals to you I strongly recommend 
EXTD=the Ray Davies CD, "The Storyteller". Davies was the inspiration for the entire VH1 series. Ray's tour in support of that album was so compelling that day after the LA show I hit the indie CD shop and picked up four Kinks CDs, and within a matter of 
EXTD=months assembled a near-complete library of Kinks CDs from "Muswell Hillbillies" to "To The Bone". "The Storyteller" is the best Kinks-related CD to come down the pike since "Schoolboys In Disgrace". \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGreat Concert, L
EXTD=ousy Edit, September 3, 2009 \nBy  Memphis Evans (St. Louis Park, MN United States]\n\nThis is a wonderful concert with surprisingly personal, revealing stories. David Bowie is obviously still at the top of his game as a performer. If you are a Bowie
EXTD=fan this is totally essential. I love his band. I love the reimagined songs. I find I don't get tired of the stories, even when I'm listening to the CD. \n\nHowever, I have some problems with the way the concert is presented. This is a DVD for home 
EXTD=use, not a broadcast with the restrictions imposed by commercial breaks and time limitations. I wish they had edited all 12 songs together and created a real concert more like the one that was enjoyed by the people who had the good fortune to see thi
EXTD=s live. \n\nInstead, there are just eight songs on the main part of the DVD and the CD. Unforgivably, the closing credits roll OVER Bowie's dramatic and moving performance of "Word On A Wing". Why? There's no pressure to get to the next show on VH1! 
EXTD=Four songs are left off of the CD entirely (although, maddeningly, they're available on iTunes) and they are only on the DVD as bonus tracks. \n\nFinal warning: "Rebel, Rebel" is very, very short and "Life On Mars?" only has the second verse. Again, 
EXTD=why was this concert and CD not re-edited into a more complete version for home release? No clue. Sort of a missed opportunity. \n\nIf you want to hear a more complete concert from the same era I highly recommend disc three of the special edition of 
EXTD="Bowie At The Beeb", although that doesn't include the priceless stories here. Plus it's out of print and you'll have to get it used so you'll avoid some possible heartbreak by making sure you are being sent the right edition before ordering. \n\nTo 
EXTD=sum up: great concert, great performances, great stories. Lousy editing and a disappointing presentation of terrific material.Bowie at the Beeb: The Best of the BBC Radio Sessions \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGood show, but could have better sto
EXTD=rytelling., August 10, 2009 \nBy  Terry (Milwaukee]\n\nThis was a good show, although short. David is very gracious and really seems to be enjoying himself. My main reason for giving it a 3 is the premise of Storytellers, which is to give insight int
EXTD=o the songs. There are annecdotes, and quite amusing ones, but not a lot of insight. An example of one I like is Natalie Merchant's, who really opens up as to the songs. Also, with the great career Bowie has put together, I don't think two songs from
EXTD=the new album are necessary, and Rebel, Rebel shouldn't be cut off. Fun, but not really storytelling about the songs. \n\nInitial post: Aug 13, 2009 8:18 AM PDT \nNever the Twain says: \n\nWhat are you talking about, Terry?! Did you fast-forward thr
EXTD=ough the story he told about "Life on Mars?"? Did you nod off when he was talking about "Drive-In Saturday" having been originally intended for Mott the Hoople? Put another way, not only are you wrong about the storytelling not addressing the songs, 
EXTD=you're also wrong about the quality. The stories were fantastic, especially the story he told about life in Berlin with Iggy Pop that lead into an awesome rendition of "China Girl." And that right there sums this release up for me. Most of the songs 
EXTD=here are not among my favorites ("Life on Mars?" and "Word on a Wing" being the notable exceptions), but the terrific renditions here, coupled with marvelous anecdotes, makes this release an essential part of the Bowie catalog.
