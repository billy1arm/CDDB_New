EXTD=he Alison Krauss of the 1970's. "Elite Hotel" was Emmylou's second effort after working with the late Gram Parsons, and in some ways typical of a lot of her work - tributes to her mentor ("Sin City" and "Wheels") while putting a rootsy spin on a broa
EXTD=d spectrum of material, including The Beatles "Here, There, and Everywhere," Patsy Cline's (well, Don Gibson's, if you want to get technical) "Sweet Dreams," and Buck Owen's "Together Again." \n\nHer voice is quite capable of breaking the hardest of 
EXTD=hearts - but I also enjoy the more uptempo numbers (her backing group, The Hot Band, was and remains one of the truly great ensembles), like the driving "Amarillo" (Emmylou's only original) and the rollicking "Feeling Single, Seeing Double" (the litt

EXTD=\n\nListening to any Emmylou Harris collection is an artistic pleasure and an education in American music. "Elite Hotel" set the bar at a high level, and put Emmylou on the way to becoming the stateswoman of country/Americana music that she is today.
EXTD=\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSublime, December 15, 2003 \nBy A Customer\n\nA wondrous new voice and a unique sound came pouring out in Emmylou's 1975 albums "Pieces of the Sky" and "Elite Hotel". Both amazing pieces of work, "Elite Hotel" is in 
EXTD=some ways superior, highlighting that gorgeous voice in its prime on perfectly chosen slow songs. My first exposure to Emmylou was her version of "Here, There, and Everywhere", which remains unspeakably gorgeous. As she did so often, she took a great
EXTD=song, made it her own, and improved on it. With all due respect to her later self-written work, for her first ten or so albums Emmylou's (then-rare) songwriting was nothing special, and her choice of material was occasionally questionable (e.g. I wa
EXTD=sn't a fan of the "Evangeline" album or of a few songs here and there). The quality of her early albums depended on her choice of songs and styles. Given good material and the Hot Band, she made magic, as here.\n\nFor those of us who'd never heard or
EXTD=wanted to hear "real" country music, Emmylou made songs like "Together Again" or "Sweet Dreams" part of our repertoire, and made them current and cool. To an unsophisticated teenager, "Jambalaya" was a Creedence Clearwater song, and I hadn't yet hea
EXTD=rd of Hank Williams, but she did the song better. Emmylou's versions of all the above remain definitive, with apologies to Patsy Cline. The same goes for her versions of Gram Parson's songs, first introduced here. She brought out the joyous feel of t
EXTD=he music better than he was able to, in my opinion, though I've since come to appreciate his own versions. In 2003, I may learn toward the versions of "Sin City" and "Las Vegas" from the Tribute album, but the versions here still beat the originals.
EXTD=\n\nThis is a perfect album and it catches Emmylou at her best in her early prime. If I had to have just one of her CD's now that she has dozens, it might not be this one, which is perhaps a bit dated now, but it would certainly be one of my contende
EXTD=rs for her best. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGreat follow-up to Pieces of the sky, April 18, 2004 \nBy  Peter Durward Harris "Pete the music fan" (Leicester England]\n\nLike many others, I tend to regard this album as the weakest of Emmylou's c
EXTD=lassic era, yet this is an outstanding album in its own right - it's just that the quality of Emmylou's first seven original albums (including her Christmas album) for Warner was unbelievably high - so much so that the eighth (Evangeline) while also 
EXTD=excellent by normal standards, has never been released on CD although several tracks have appeared on compilations.\n\nThis album contains many covers but other singers have recorded covers of the original songs included here, so this is a very influ

EXTD=de Amarillo (a rousing up-tempo song that Kathy Mattea covered for her album, Lonesome standard time), Feeling single seeing double (another up-tempo song - this one has been covered by Chely Wright for her album, Let me in) and Till I gain control a

EXTD=r covers include Jambalaya (a Hank Williams song that became a pop hit for Jo Stafford at the time and later became a pop hit for the Carpenters), Here there and everywhere (which became a UK pop hit for Emmylou) and two songs that became country num
EXTD=ber one hits for Emmylou - Together again (Buck Owens) and Sweet dreams (the Don Gibson song normally associated with Patsy Cline).\n\nSo this is a very strong album, with or without the Rhino bonus tracks. If you are interested in building a collect
