EXTD=Released March 18, 2003\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (This compilation)
EXTD=Even more so than its predecessor, the Raven two-fer Right or Wr
EXTD=ong/Seven Year Ache, this pair of albums on one CD shows the dept
EXTD=h and breadth of how far Rosanne Cash was willing to go in order 
EXTD=to remake modern country music into something she considered not 
EXTD=only interesting but also valid for the time period. Somewhere in
EXTD=the Stars and Rhythm and Romance are exercises in making seamless 
EXTD=all the music that she and Rodney Crowell, her then husband, prod
EXTD=ucer, and collaborator, had absorbed in London, Los Angeles, and 
EXTD=New York. On these two records, particularly on the latter, Cash 
EXTD=utilized the sounds of British new wave and the L.A. studio sound
EXTD=as a bottom for her lyrical and melodic explorations. The two di
EXTD=scs are sharply contrasted by two things: On Somewhere in the Sta
EXTD=rs, Cash and producer Crowell chose mainly material by other song
EXTD=writers, and on Rhythm and Romance, Crowell departed as producer an
EXTD=d Cash wrote nearly everything on the record. Both records charte
EXTD=d and did very well, but Rhythm and Romance went to number one, gar
EXTD=nering a pair of singles in that spot as well as a Grammy for Cas
EXTD=h's "I Don't Know Why You Don't Want Me." Sonically, they dovetai
EXTD=l one another. Whereas on Stars, Cash and Crowell experiment with
EXTD=textures and riffs from various other types of pop music, on Rhy
EXTD=thm and Romance there is no holding back, from the tough guitars to
EXTD=Benmont Tench's keyboards to the album's more rock and soul feel
EXTD=ing overall. Each album stands on its own, and as a pair they are
EXTD=an amazing whole and deeply satisfying listening experience, sta
