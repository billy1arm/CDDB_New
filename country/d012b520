EXTD=Born To Sing - Disc 3 of 4\n© 2001 Bear Family Records\n\nUPC: 40
EXTD=00127163684\nCat Number: BCD 16368 DI\n\nOriginally Released May 
EXTD=8, 2001\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  This set is one of the many reason
EXTD=s why Bear Family is the reissue label of many kinds of American 
EXTD=roots music -- especially country, rockabilly, Western swing and 
EXTD=bluegrass. Connie Smith, who still records on occasion today, was
EXTD=one of countrypolitan's first country music superstars of her ge
EXTD=nder after Patsy Cline, whom she was often compared to because sh
EXTD=e came onto the scene with the number one single "Once a Day" (pe
EXTD=nned by Bill Anderson who got her a record deal). These four disc
EXTD=s document her amazing RCA career in 127 cuts! While it's true th
EXTD=at Smith recorded for Columbia and Monument, it was the RCA sides
EXTD=that cemented her reputation as both a performer and as a songwr
EXTD=iter. While Smith has less than a handful of her own cuts here, i
EXTD=t hardly matters. She worked with the top songwriters in the busi
EXTD=ness at the time, including Anderson who wrote for her until she 
EXTD=semi-retired. Others include Dallas Frazier, Bobby Bare, Albert B
EXTD=rumley, Hank Cochran, Arthur Smith, June Carter Cash, and Jimmie 
EXTD=Davis. Her entire RCA output is here, and taken as a whole or in 
EXTD=parts, it is stunning and reflects the height of the country musi
EXTD=c establishment in the '60s and the countrypolitan sound. That sa
EXTD=id, Smith's voice is what remains center-stage here - her sophisti
EXTD=cated emotional delivery, her control and phrasing remain a high-
EXTD=water mark today.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review
EXTD=\n(4-CD LP-sized box set with 56-page book) All of country singer
EXTD='s RCA recordings from July 1964 to Sept. 1967. It not only inclu
EXTD=des Once A Day, but all the great early hits like Then and Only The
EXTD=n, Tiny Blue Transistor Radio and others. Her French sessions are a
EXTD=lso included. The cream of Nashville's songwriters wanted their s
EXTD=ongs interpreted by Connie, and here are some of the greatest ear

EXTD=ZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nCountry Legend Connie Smith's RCA Record
EXTD=ings March 14, 2001\nBy Ron Frankl \n\nFor anyone who ever said "
EXTD=I could listen to Connie Smith sing all night," well, here's your
EXTD=chance. Those wonderful obsessives at Bear Family Records have r
EXTD=eissued the country great's complete recordings from her heyday i
EXTD=n the mid-Sixties, when the singer was tearing up the charts.\n\n
EXTD=Connie Smith was a housewife with two children when she began her
EXTD=recording career under the patronage of singer/songwriter Bill A
EXTD=nderson. Her first single, "Once A Day," was a smash hit, and for
EXTD=the next three years she was one of Nashville's biggest female s
EXTD=tars. Smith had a perfect voice for country music, with the tell-
EXTD=tale "sob" in her voice that made many of her songs almost heartb
EXTD=reakingly beautiful. Most tellingly, Smith was even more admired 
EXTD=by her peers than her fans. She walked away from a successful car
EXTD=eer in the Seventies to raise her children and because she grew i
EXTD=ncreasingly uncomfortable with the nature of the music business.\n
EXTD=\nConnie Smith fans once had to search far and wide for her RCA r
EXTD=ecordings, but they have been more accessible in recent times. RC
EXTD=A released a solid one disc "best of" four years ago and her firs
EXTD=t two albums were reissued in their entirety in 2000. "Born To Si
EXTD=ng" is a four CD box and contains everything she recorded for the
EXTD=label. Its a wonderful package, with first-class sound, and whic
EXTD=h includes Bear Family's usual comprehensive booklet. Although th
EXTD=ere is a lot of terrific music here, this boxed set is probably b
EXTD=est for Smith's hardcore fans - casual fans should probably stick 
EXTD=to the single disc compilation. Still, this is a superior package
EXTD=Its nice to have all of Connie's RCA classics and rarties avail
EXTD=able, and to see her receive the recognition she deserves.\n\nInc
EXTD=identally, Connie Smith is still going strong as of this writing 
EXTD=(March 2001). She performs regularly at the Grand Ole Opry, and s
EXTD=he recorded a fine CD for Warner Brothers in 1998, produced by he
