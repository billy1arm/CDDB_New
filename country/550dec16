EXTD=Willie Hugh Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas in 1933 during the depression. He was raised as a church going Methodist, learning to\nsing unaccompanied at Sunday school and Wednesday night prayer meetings. This is where Willie learned to sing and dev

EXTD=rakers, Webb Pierce, Ray Price, Leon Russell...Frank Sinatra\n\n  Over a 40 year roller coaster ride of a career, Willie has made more than 50genre straddling albums for a number of labels. He has been considered a rebel and a redneck, a loner and a
EXTD=fighter, a prophet and a poet.\n\n  A typical Willie Nelson story comes from a package tour he undertook in 1966 with country staples Marty Robbins, Stonewall Jackson, Jeannie Sealy, Hank Cochran and Johnny Bush. The promoter hired a new singer for

EXTD=this was the smartest thing to do, but after hearing Pride's         'Snakes Crawl At Night' his mind was made up - Charlie was in.\n\n   One night during the tour, the entourage had a night off and all concerned  went down to the legendary Longhor
EXTD=n Ballroom in Dallas. The venue had a policy of 'overlooking' black artists so Willie did what he had to do, he brought Charlie Pride up to the stage to the disbelief of the assembled throng, and planted a kiss on his lips. Pride performed to an ecs

EXTD=At the time of writing Willie tours virtually constantly, runs daily, has\nbeen known to take a drink and is no stranger to a jazz cigarette. Willie Nelson is a great singer, a brillian guitar player, a magnificent songwriter and one hell of an Amer
