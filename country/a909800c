EXTD=the title track, which is a sorrowful indictment of her husband's

EXTD=REVIEW: Cash was arguably the most important artist to emerge in
EXTD=country music in the early 80s, and this was her breakthrough al
EXTD=bum, which introduced a new, assertive, passionate stance to wome
EXTD=n in country and also helped foster the crossover between folk, r
EXTD=ock, and country. Cash's songwriting (the title track and "Blue M
EXTD=oon with a Heartache") was first-rate, and her choices from other
EXTD=s, notably Leroy Preston's "My Baby Thinks He's a Train," were eq
EXTD=ually strong. -- William Ruhlmann\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Blame who

EXTD=XPERT REVIEW: (2-on-1 Compilation) The issue of Rosanne Cash's fi
EXTD=rst two Columbia albums in a single package is not only a listeni
EXTD=ng delight, it's more importantly a historical document. In the s
EXTD=ame way archivists go back to finds the roots of certain evolutio
EXTD=ns in earlier strains of country music, these two records will be
EXTD=marked undoubtedly as the turning point from the countrypolitan 
EXTD=and outlaw sounds of the late '70s to the fusion of country music
EXTD=with modern pop styles that could crossover and reach audiences 
EXTD=on both sides of the country music divide. It also marked the res
EXTD=urgence of the female singer/songwriter that the music hadn't see
EXTD=n since the late '50s through the mid-'60s. Right or Wrong is Cas
EXTD=h's first collaboration with her husband and producer, Rodney Cro
EXTD=well. Formerly a member of Emmylou Harris's Hot Band, he recruite
EXTD=d Emmylou's crew for this project and picked Los Angeles as the s
EXTD=ite - Cash chose songs based on their merit as songs rather than a
EXTD=s country-potential country records. Consequently, writers such a
EXTD=s Keith Sykes, Karen Brookes, Gary P. Nunn, and (at least on the 
EXTD=British version) Lennon and McCartney got shots at the mainstream
EXTD=country charts. In addition, Cash and Crowell both honed their s
EXTD=ongwriting skills specific to her voice and delivery style, to th
EXTD=e point where on Seven Year Ache they scored with three number on
EXTD=e singles and a Top Ten album. Two of those singles, the title tr
EXTD=ack and "Blue Moon With Heartache," were Cash compositions. The t
EXTD=hird single, Leroy Preston's "My Baby Thinks He's a Train," was c
EXTD=overed by virtually every major female country performer in its w
EXTD=ake. Add covers of Tom Petty and Steve Forbert songs and the appe
EXTD=arance of the queen herself, Emmylou Harris, and you have a dynam
EXTD=ite recording. These sides hold up well over two decades later --
EXTD=especially after what happened to country in the '90s (yeccccchh
EXTD=hhhh!!!!). The sound is pristine, the package has extensive liner
EXTD=notes, and there are bonus tracks to boot. Necessary. -- Thom Ju

EXTD=SA]\n"Seven Year Ache" was Rosanne Cash's second major label albu
EXTD=m. Released in 1981 and was very much in the same vein that Emmyl
EXTD=ou Harris's albums had been from. No surprise since Rodney Crowel
EXTD=l who had been a member of Emmy's Hot Band was now working with R
EXTD=osanne. The album spawned three #1 country hits, the title track,
EXTD="My Baby Thinks He's A Train" and the incredible "Blue Moon With
EXTD=Heartache". Much like Emmylou Harris's albums from the late 70's
EXTD=, there isn't a weak track on the album. Emmylou even shows up si
EXTD=nging harmony on the album. Vince Gill and Ricky Scaggs also prov
EXTD=ide backing vocals. One of the tracks, "Hometown Blues" was writt
EXTD=en by Tom Petty, Rosanne was probably the first country artist to
EXTD=cover a Petty song. Incidently the track sounds somewhat similar
EXTD=to Petty's "Thing About You" which appeared on his "Hard Promise

EXTD=Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. Today's country artist
EXTD=s could learn a thing or two from this album! By the way, the two
EXTD=bonus tracks are "The Feeling" which is listed as previously unr
EXTD=eleased, but Rosanne's 1982 single "Ain't No Money" was backed by
EXTD=a song called "The Feeling" it's probably the same song. The oth

EXTD=y solid effort. I really liked her debut 'Right or Wrong', but 'S
EXTD=even Year Ache' gave a good glance at what was really to come. \n
EXTD=\nNothing against the outside writers who contributed their songs
EXTD=but for her initial songwriting efforts, she pulls off two extr

EXTD="Blue Moon w/Heartache"). \n\nAll tracks have their high points 
EXTD=and the only I one I usually skip over is 'Hometown Blues". "Se

EXTD=is up there w/the perfect songs of this genre....and pretty good 
EXTD=overall for most. \n\nCash's vocals are strong and Rodney Crowell
EXTD='s production is clean - almost too clean. Good use of Crowell's

EXTD=\n\nThe extra track for this disk is ok, but nothing that anyon
EXTD=e was ever missing. The live version of "Seven Year Ache" is mudd
