EXTD=er in America and elsewhere around the world, Buck Owens and His Bu
EXTD=ckaroos went to the London Palladium as if there was nothing a li
EXTD=ttle Bakersfield country music couldn't cure. And the London audi
EXTD=ence loved it - they ate it up like chocolate. The audience frenzy
EXTD=- actual, not added -- of the first medley of "Act Naturally" a
EXTD=nd "Together Again" is unnerving. The cornball humor is everywher
EXTD=e and this sophisticated London audience falls for this terrible 
EXTD=sh*t -- but the music rocks in true Buck fashion. Check out the b
EXTD=ad-ass Ventures-meets-Bakersfield boogie of "A Happening in Londo
EXTD=n Town." Buck and crew whip through "Sweet Rosie Jones," Merle Ha
EXTD=ggard's "Sing Me Back Home," and "Sam's Place" before the side en
EXTD=ds. Side two has two medleys, one of Buck's hits, "Love's Gonna L
EXTD=ive Here," "Cryin' Time," "I've Got a Tiger by the Tail," and "Op
EXTD=en up Your Heart." It's raw and wild and louder than sh*t. There'
EXTD=s a short medley of Louisiana Cajun tunes before Buck goes from t
EXTD=he sacred ("Dust on Mother's Bible") to the wonderfully profane (
EXTD="Johnny B. Goode") to close the show. Buck playing Chuck Berry --
EXTD=now there's some deep paradox that proves that music is the univ
EXTD=ersal language, and the significance of it was not lost on the Lo
EXTD=ndon audience.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description
EXTD=\nBuck Owens was the original, border-bustin' ambassador of Ameri
EXTD=can country music. Beginning with his acclaimed live stint at Car
EXTD=negie Hall, to Japan where the crowd's overwhelming enthusiasm wa
EXTD=s downright staggering, Buck would continue to herd his posse int
EXTD=o venues worldwide. But he'd wait to hit yet another landmark loc
EXTD=ale before recording his next live album. At the renown London Pa
EXTD=lladium, Buck and his Buckaroos performed a full program of their
EXTD=all-time hits and added to the festive frenzy with then-recent, 
EXTD=single successes like "Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass" and "Johnny B.
EXTD=Goode." And it's all captured here: from emcee David Allen's int
EXTD=roduction to Buck's affectionate on-stage patter to the stellar p
EXTD=erformances themselves. An album to be royally remembered and rel
EXTD=ived, Sundazed is proud to present Buck Owens in London on compac
EXTD=t disc for the first time. Enhanced with informative new liners, 
EXTD=bonus tracks and much more, it's a gala affair as only a born 'n'

EXTD=kers like "Dust on Mother's Bible." In addition to Owens's patent
EXTD=ed Bakersfield twang, the set features the outstanding guitar and
EXTD=fiddle playing of Don Rich, best displayed on instrumental cuts 
EXTD=like the brief yet dynamic "Buckaroo," and the traditional zydeco
EXTD=flavored "Cajun Fiddle." In an interesting piece of trivia, the 
EXTD=recording was engineered by Geoff Emerick, best known for his gro

EXTD=uck's Best Live Album, December 21, 2005\nBy Paul W. Dennis (Wint
EXTD=er Springs, FL USA]\n\nBuck Owens issued a lot of live albums (so
EXTD=me of them released only in the country where recorded such as li
EXTD=ve albums in Stockholm, Australia and a second live album in Japa
EXTD=n). This is the best of the live albums and not only because I ha
EXTD=ppened to be in the audience that March 9,1969 (with my Dad - my 
EXTD=present to him on his 44th birthday). While the previously releas
EXTD=ed live albums recorded at Carnegie Hall and in Tokyo are indeed 
EXTD=excellent, by the time this album was released, Owens had adopted
EXTD=a faster and more swinging tempo for hits such as "Act Naturally
EXTD=" and "Sam's Place". Indeed, his take on Chuck Berry's "Johnny B.
EXTD=Goode" (his then-#1 single) is easily the equal of the Chuck Ber
EXTD=ry original and smokes most of the other cover versions of the so
EXTD=ng. This version of the Buckaroos included Jerry Wiggins on drums
EXTD=and Jay D. Maness on steel guitar, both as good as the musicians
EXTD=they replaced( Willie C Cantu and Tom Brumley). By the time this
EXTD=album was recorded, Owens had such a long list of hits that he h
EXTD=ad to resort to medleys to get some of them worked into the show 
EXTD=("Love's Gonna Live Here"/"Cryin' Time" /"I've Got a Tiger by the
EXTD=Tail"/"Open Up Your Heart" and "Act Naturally"/"Together Again" 
EXTD=are two of the medleys). To mark the occasion Buck had penned an 
EXTD=uptempo instrumental tune "A Happening In London Town" \n\nThis C
EXTD=D (on Sundazed) is an expanded version of the 1969 Capitol album 
EXTD=with four additional songs "I've Got You On My Mind Again" and "T
EXTD=hat's All Right with Me (If It's All Right with You)" both from h
EXTD=is I'VE GOT YOU ON MY MIND AGAIN album (the title cut went to #1)

EXTD=mental "Buckaroo" \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe REAL King
EXTD=of Country Music, April 6, 2006\nBy Tim C. Sanderford\n\nJust as
EXTD=instrumental in country music as Waylon and Willie leaving Nashv
EXTD=ille for Austin, Buck Owens' move to Bakersfield changed what we 
EXTD=listen to forever. The heavy Telecaster sound and mostly lighthea
EXTD=rted lyrics was a welcome change from background strings and choi
EXTD=rlike choruses. \n\nThe duo of Buck Owens and Don Rich compare fa
EXTD=vorably to any other in any genre of music. The rest of the Bucka
EXTD=roos lineup changed from time to time, but it really didn't matte
EXTD=r. The Owens/Rich sound stayed true to life, night after night. \n
EXTD=\nI was fortunate enough to see Buck and the Buckaroos as a young
EXTD=boy of 11 years. I can still hear the music, the banter between 
EXTD=songs, and those vocals. When Buck and Don smiled, you automatica
EXTD=lly did so as well. After Don's death, Buck was still a great sho
EXTD=w, but the two together were unbeatable. \n\nThis album, recorded
EXTD=in London, brings the live experience home. Newer fans might be 
EXTD=surprised at the amount of joking and talking between songs, but 
EXTD=at that time it was all part of the show, and the audience couldn
EXTD='t get enough of it. The music quality is excellent for a live re
EXTD=cording. Fans of studio music wont be disappointed. There are sev
EXTD=eral newly released tracks as well. \n\nDo yourself a favor. Buy 
EXTD=this album. Listen to it and then turn on CMT. Listen to a few of
EXTD=today's country songs. The influence of Buck Owens and Don Rich 
EXTD=are everywhere.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nShort but Sweet,
EXTD=February 17, 2006\nBy Rock n' Roll Cowboy (Colorado, USA]\n\nBuc
EXTD=k and the Buckaroos sound great and this CD is very pleasant to l
EXTD=isten to. Jay Dee Maness took over for Tom Brumley on steel guita
EXTD=r. While Maness is very good, he's not as good as Brumley. What I
EXTD=also liked is how Buck blended a lot of humor into his shows. He
EXTD='s often cracking jokes, I bet it'd be a treat to see him play li
EXTD=ve. The best songs in my opinon are - "Happy Times Are Here Again
EXTD=", a touching "Dust On Mother's Bible", and an awesome Don Rich i
EXTD=ntsrumental "Cajun Fiddle" A lot of the medleys were good too, bu
EXTD=t too quick. \n\nMy big knock on the CD is it's quite short and s
EXTD=eems rushed. Too many of the songs are played very fast and quick
EXTD=and a lot of them are crammed into short medleys. "Who's Gonna M
EXTD=ow Your Grass" is done in a minute and a half. Most of the songs 
EXTD=are 2 minutes long. It would have been nice if he'd play the full
EXTD=versions on his most popular songs in concert. A good quarter of
EXTD=the disc is Buck talking so all in all it's probably 30 minutes 
EXTD=of music if even that. All in all, it's a good disc to reccomend 
EXTD=to Buck fans, but it's not his greatest work by any means. I'd gi
EXTD=ve it 3 and a half stars if it'd let me.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER
