EXTD=e about relationships breaking down, about falling out of love. D
EXTD=reamland Express is more optimistic -- it's about falling in love
EXTD=again." So said John Denver upon the release of Dreamland Expres
EXTD=s, and it's a fair remark except for one thing: the album is not 
EXTD=about John Denver falling in love again. Denver contributed only 
EXTD=four of the album's 11 songs, and on his numbers, he is still tal
EXTD=king about falling out of love. From the title track, which finds
EXTD=him awake at four a.m. again, to "A Wild Heart Looking For Home,
EXTD=" in which he is "sleeping without you" and "hoping that someone 
EXTD=might phone." It's only on the cover songs that Denver gets to ex
EXTD=press positive romantic feelings, and even those have a certain n
EXTD=ostalgic sense. Whether the songs are actually from the 1950s, su
EXTD=ch as Roy Orbison's "Claudette," or more recent, such as "I'm In 
EXTD=The Mood To Be Desired," they have an early rock and roll style to 
EXTD=them. So, it's still more like remembered love than new love. Den
EXTD=ver has toned down the world peace themes. Though "Trail Of Tears
EXTD=" has a Native American theme, and his own "African Sunrise" chro
EXTD=nicles a trip the singer took for UNICEF, the songs are shunted o
EXTD=ff to the end of the record. The intention seems to have been to 
EXTD=reverse Denver's diminishing record sales by seeking sunnier outs
EXTD=ide material, but Dreamland Express just comes off as a less-pers
EXTD=onal effort, and it was not a success.   -- William Ruhlmann\n\n\n

EXTD=\n\nHaving bought JD's albums since 1972 I had a lull - if I got 
EXTD=bored or not I have no idea, he just did not seem to fit anymore.
EXTD=So I missed some releases. This was one, but when I heard it I r
EXTD=egreted missing it - the music is rarely spectacular but it is ve
EXTD=ry warm and engaging. Now the CD is a regular on my play list sim
EXTD=ply because it makes me feel good.And it generated my interest in
EXTD=his other late period releases. It is too easy to be critical as
EXTD=it set no real hights, but there are no lows either. It covers a
EXTD=variety of styles (Doo Wop as well) but remains JD - try it and 
EXTD=you won't be sorry - except that you didn't hear it sooner.\n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNot Denver's finest hour, June 17, 20
EXTD=05 \nBy  Prussian Blue (Brisbane,Australia]\n\nI really like John
EXTD=Denver,but I HATE this record.By 1985,when MTV, Michael Jackson 
EXTD=and Lionel Ritchie's dance-flavoured music ruled the airwaves,and
EXTD=John's record sales were waning,you can tell some bean counter o
EXTD=r wunderkinder record producer at RCA/BMG thought "I know! Let's 
EXTD=give him a more 'modern' sound and image!We'll even put him in a 
EXTD=sexy video!The kids will love it!" So rather than the acoustic fo
EXTD=lk/rock sound and bittersweet self-penned paens to nature and roman
EXTD=tic love than characterised his usual style,here John goes thru' 
EXTD=the motions of singing works by others that include soul,R and B an
EXTD=d even a disco song!It's an ill fit,and although vocally and arti
EXTD=stically he does his best(the soaring falsetto vocals on 'If I Ev
EXTD=er" being particularly fine)his heart simply isn't in it.The exce
EXTD=ption is 'African Sunrise'the only original Denver tune on the LP
EXTD=,a song written while the singer spent time in Ethiopia for the H
EXTD=unger Project,and the only one that he sounds truly 'at home' on.
EXTD=If you'd like to seek out Denver's music,I'd recommend my favorit
EXTD=e Denver albums"I Want to Live" and 'Windsong"-full of beautiful 
EXTD=melodies and lush orchestration and much more indicative of the tru
EXTD=e talent of the man.This album is an unfortunate abherration from
EXTD=an impressive body of work from a lovely singer-songwriter.When 
EXTD=he was on form though,nobody could beat him as a showman and song
EXTD=writer.There was no one else quite like him and like many,I miss
