EXTD=ing his allegiance to Atlantic (where he would record two remarka
EXTD=ble albums that would get him kicked off the label), Willie Nelso
EXTD=n offered his finest record to date for his debut -- possibly his
EXTD=finest album ever. Shotgun Willie encapsulates Willie's world vi
EXTD=ew and music, finding him at a peak as a composer, interpreter, a
EXTD=nd performer. This is laid-back, deceptively complex music, equal
EXTD=parts country, rock attitude, jazz musicianship, and troubadour 
EXTD=storytelling. Nelson blurs the lines between his own tunes and co
EXTD=vers to the point that "Whiskey River," this record's best-known 
EXTD=song, seems thoroughly original, yet it was written by Johnny Bus
EXTD=h and Paul Stroud. This, along with two songs apiece by Leon Russ
EXTD=ell and Bob Wills, provides context for his originals, with Shotg
EXTD=un Willie becoming a musical autobiography, offering not only ins
EXTD=ights into his musicality (witness how he slows down "Stay All Ni
EXTD=ght [Stay a Little Longer]" to a slow shuffle) but, seemingly, in
EXTD=to himself (most notably on the title track and the wonderful, fu
EXTD=nny travelogue "Devil in a Sleepin' Bag"). Nelson wasn't just at 
EXTD=a peak of performing here -- he also wrote some of his greatest s
EXTD=ongs, highlighted not just by the previously mentioned tunes but 
EXTD=also by the lovely slow waltz "Slow Down Old World" and "Sad Song
EXTD=s and Waltzes." All of it adds up to possibly the finest record i
EXTD=n a career filled with hits and highlights.  -- Stephen Thomas Er
EXTD=lewine\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (Phases And Stages)  If Shotgun Wi
EXTD=llie played a bit like a concept album, Phases and Stages was a f
EXTD=ull-blown one, tracing the dissolution of a marriage and devoting
EXTD=one side to the wife's perspective, the second to the husband's.
EXTD=If anything, Willie overplays his hand a bit, insisting on graft
EXTD=ing the "Phases and Stages" theme between crucial songs to the po
EXTD=int of genuine irritation. But, pretend that never happened, eras
EXTD=e it from your mind, and Phases and Stages is easily the equal of
EXTD=its remarkable predecessor, a wonderful set of music that resona
EXTD=tes deeply, as deeply as the words. Make no mistake -- the decept
EXTD=ively relaxed arrangements, including the occasional strings, not
EXTD=only highlight Nelson's clever eclecticism, but they also height
EXTD=en the emotional impact of the album. And this is a hell of an em
EXTD=otional record, where even each side's celebratory honky tonk num
EXTD=bers (the medley "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Jo
EXTD=int" and "Pick Up the Tempo," respectively) are muted by sadness.
EXTD=Then, there are the centerpieces: "Walkin'," where the woman dec
EXTD=ides it's time to move on - "Pretend I Never Happened," perhaps th
EXTD=e coldest ending to a relationship ever written - "Bloody Mary Mor
EXTD=ning," a bleary-eyed morning-after tale that became a standard - "
EXTD=It's Not Supposed to Be That Way," a nearly unbearably melancholy
EXTD=account of a love gone wrong - and "Heaven and Hell," a waltz sum
EXTD=mary of the relationship. Any two of these would have formed a st
EXTD=rong core for an album, but placed together in a narrative contex
EXTD=t, their impact is even more considerable. As a result, this is n
EXTD=ot just one of Willie Nelson's best records, but one of the great

EXTD=ERT REVIEW: (MFSL 2-on-1 Gold CD)  Although Willie Nelson's two a
EXTD=lbums for Atlantic Records -- Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stage
EXTD=s -- were among his most unsuccessful records commercially, they 
EXTD=were groundbreaking, pivotal releases that rank among his finest 
EXTD=and most introspective works. Musically, both albums straddle the
EXTD=lines between outlaw country, folk, and traditional pop -- they 
EXTD=are innovative, introspective works that sounded unlike his previ
EXTD=ous work. Additionally, both records are concept albums, with eac
EXTD=h of the songs intertwining to tell a story. Shotgun Willie is ab
EXTD=out a legendary outlaw - Phases and Stages is about a divorce, wit
EXTD=h the first side taking the perspective of the male, the second t
EXTD=aking the female view point. Neither album produced big hits, but

EXTD=m Yesterday's Wine. Recorded in Muscle Shoals, Phases and Stages 
EXTD=was an album he'd had in his mind since leaving RCA (where he'd f

EXTD=compositions and older ones into a compelling, seamless explorat
EXTD=ion of emotions ranging from shock to anger to anguish and, final
EXTD=ly, healing and acceptance. The first five numbers chronicle the 
EXTD=woman's viewpoint. Nelson explores the male perspective on songs 
EXTD=6 through 11 with sympathetic accompaniment throughout from a rhy
EXTD=thm section, Johnny Gimble's fiddle, and John Hughey's pedal stee

EXTD=W. Reynolds "doctor_mindbender" (VA USA]\n\nThere have been bette
EXTD=r voices in country music, but never a better vocalist than Willi
EXTD=e Nelson. I consider him on par with Frank Sinatra or Sam Cooke i
EXTD=n terms of singing skill. He knows exactly what he wants out of e

EXTD=inventive and unique. Although he is widely lauded for his song-
EXTD=writing ability, it is his delivery that makes the songs stand ou
EXTD=t. Shotgun Willie is no exception. \n\nUnlike Red-Headed Stranger
EXTD=or Phases and Stages, there is no unifying concept to hold the a
EXTD=lbum together. This is just Willie being Willie. He's so relaxed 
EXTD=and comfortable with the material that the tempo never really mak
EXTD=es it above a laid back toe-tapper. And who cares? I could sit ba
EXTD=ck and tap my toe to music of this caliber much longer than the 4
EXTD=0 minute running time. Another difference from his string of conc
EXTD=ept albums is the variety of songs here. Tougher than Leather, fo
EXTD=r instance, seems to run together a little bit, and even his fine
EXTD=st conceptual efforts repeat musical themes throughout, making th
EXTD=em more of an overall experience. On Shotgun Willie, every track 
EXTD=can stand alone. There is no filler. The title track is wry and a
EXTD=musing with an accompanying horn section that sounds just at home
EXTD=as the strings backing Willie on "Slow Down Old World", or the h
EXTD=onky-tonk piano and fiddle on "Bubbles in My Beer". "Whiskey Rive
EXTD=r" is worlds apart from his raucous live version, but none-the-le
EXTD=ss effective. By the time he chuckles on the second verse of the 
EXTD=track, you are so engrossed that you chuckle along with him, even
EXTD=though you're not sure what's so funny. \n\nThat's not to say th
EXTD=at the songs aren't cohesive, because they are. The arrangements 
EXTD=are lovely and uncluttered regardless of what instruments are uti
EXTD=lized. Willie's humor is evident on many tracks (particularly on 
EXTD=one of my favorites, "You Look Like the Devil in the Morning"). A
EXTD=nd the covers stand along side the originals in seamless harmony.
EXTD=These are all Willie's songs now. Despite the sad lyrical conten
EXTD=t (these are by and large break-up songs), this is a joyous album
EXTD=to behold. The only song that breaks the playful mood is the fin
EXTD=al track, a cover of Leon Russell's "A Song for You". This one ma
EXTD=y have you spilling tears in your beer, but only because the star
EXTD=k vocal performance is truly affecting. \n\nShotgun Willie may be
EXTD=Nelson's finest hour (Stranger provides the strongest argument o
