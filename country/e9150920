EXTD=with Capitol Records, Merle Haggard departed the label for MCA i
EXTD=n 1977, kicking off a five-year stint that is by most measures th
EXTD=e most turbulent in the singer/songwriter's career. Capitol wasn'
EXTD=t the only longtime relationship he left behind as he faced 40. H
EXTD=e left Bonnie Owens for Leona Williams, who soon replaced Bonnie 
EXTD=as his wife and duet partner. He tentatively began recording in N
EXTD=ashville, where he was convinced to leave behind his road-tested 
EXTD=Strangers in favor of studio pros. He suffered a bit of a dry spe
EXTD=ll as a songwriter, leading him to record beloved covers and ques
EXTD=tionable new tunes alike. All these ups and downs are evident on 
EXTD=2012's The Troubadour, Bear Family's fourth Merle Haggard box, wh
EXTD=ich chronicles the entirety of those MCA recordings over the cour
EXTD=se of 111 tracks. Haggard closed his run at MCA in a stronger pos
EXTD=ition than he started and the music here is pretty much the worki
EXTD=ng definition of a transitional period. Hag tries on different so
EXTD=unds and recording styles, rushing out a heartfelt tribute to a d
EXTD=eparted Elvis Presley, then agreeing to attempt to cash in on the
EXTD=CB radio craze way after the "Convoy" had passed, happily record
EXTD=ing a duet with Clint Eastwood for Bronco Billy, grudgingly cutti
EXTD=ng "If We're Not Back in Love by Monday" -- a plain ripoff of his
EXTD=own "If We Make It Through December" -- but throwing himself int
EXTD=o Jimmy Bowen's meticulous production for Serving 190 Proof, wher
EXTD=e he'd cut no more than one track a day. Serving 190 Proof wound 
EXTD=up as one of Haggard's great albums and it's hardly the only high
EXTD=light from these years. That Elvis Presley tribute is surprising 
EXTD=and soulful, Back to the Barrooms is an excellent hard country re
EXTD=cord, and he wrapped up his time with the rollicking live album R
EXTD=ainbow Stew: Live at Anaheim Stadium. Along the way, he cut a few
EXTD=songs that qualify as Haggard classics -- the gorgeously heartbr
EXTD=oken "Misery and Gin" and its defiant counterpart "I Think I'll J
EXTD=ust Stay Here and Drink," the moody "I'm Always on the Mountain W
EXTD=hen I Fall" -- a bunch of strong straight-ahead country, some bea
EXTD=utiful neglected gems like the unreleased song that lends its tit
EXTD=le to this box, a pretty good collection of spiritual tunes dedic
EXTD=ated to his mom, plus some flotsam that's interesting as cultural
EXTD=artifacts (that CB single "The Bull and the Beaver"/"I'm Getting
EXTD=High," music for the botched 1981 blockbuster The Legend of the 
EXTD=Lone Ranger). By any measure this box is a mixed bag, but it's a 
EXTD=fascinating one because it tells a story: at the beginning Merle 
EXTD=seems lost but by the time it wraps up, Haggard has regained his 
EXTD=voice and authority, weathering his midlife crisis and becoming s
EXTD=tronger once again.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
