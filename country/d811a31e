EXTD=Louisiana honky tonk, much of Faron Young's early work on Capito
EXTD=l is marked by an undertone of grinning lasciviousness. That's no
EXTD=t a bad thing, given how many of his industry pals completely hid
EXTD=their wolfishness behind apple-pie lyrics. In any case, Bear Fam
EXTD=ily has here collected the entirety of Young's Capitol output on 
EXTD=five CDs. Besides the swaggering stuff ("If You Ain't Lovin'," "L
EXTD=ive Fast, Love Hard, Die Young," and the amazing "Alone with You"
EXTD=) one can hear the hit version of "Sweet Dreams" he cut seven yea
EXTD=rs before Patsy Cline's. It comes with a beautiful 48-page book. 
EXTD=- Dan Cooper\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review: \nFaron Young's 
EXTD=Capitol recordings (complete here for the first time) capture ten
EXTD=years of country music history. Beginning as a Hank Williams dis
EXTD=ciple, Faron found his own voice and scored hits. Then he tried h
EXTD=is hand at R&R before coming back to basics. Finally, he became a
EXTD=pioneer of the Nashville Sound with hits like Hello Walls. Ten t
EXTD=urbulent years - all of them here.
