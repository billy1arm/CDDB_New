EXTD=allment of ABKCO's series of box sets containing CD replicas of t
EXTD=he Rolling Stones' original singles for Decca and London during t
EXTD=he '60s seems not quite as impressive as the first two, there's a
EXTD=reason for it: it's not. But that has little to do with either t
EXTD=he music -- some of the Stones' very best is here, including "Str
EXTD=eet Fighting Man," "Honky Tonk Women," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash," 
EXTD=all viable contenders for the greatest rock and roll single ever --
EXTD=or the packaging, which is every bit as lavish and loving as the
EXTD=first two installments. Instead, the problem is that the nine si
EXTD=ngles collected here are a bit of a hodgepodge. The aforementione
EXTD=d trio are the group's last singles of the '60s, with the latter 
EXTD=two being the last two singles the band conceived as stand-alone 
EXTD=45s. After that, there were two singles pulled from the 1971 albu
EXTD=m Sticky Fingers -- "Brown Sugar" and "Wild Horses," both backed 
EXTD=by album tracks (the former had a live version of Chuck Berry's "
EXTD=Let It Rock" on a U.K. pressing, but that's not available here) -
EXTD=and that LP is more commonly associated with the Stones' '70s a
EXTD=lbums for their own label, not their '60s work, so even if histor
EXTD=ically they were part of the London years, they don't quite feel 
EXTD=like the end of this chapter - rather, they feel like the beginnin
EXTD=g of the next. That accounts for half of Singles 1968-1971. The r
EXTD=emaining five discs contain Mick Jagger's excellent solo single o
EXTD=f "Memo from Turner" from the film Performance, two singles from 
EXTD=the 1975 '60s rarities compilation Metamorphosis ("I Don't Know W
EXTD=hy"/"Jiving Sister Fanny" and "I Don't Know Why"/"Try a Little Ha
EXTD=rder"), the "Sympathy for the Devil" single -- which was released
EXTD=in the U.K. in 1976, but is presented in its 2003 form containin
EXTD=g contemporary dance remixes by the Neptunes and Fatboy Slim, var
EXTD=iations that are, needless to say, rather incongruous in this set
EXTD=ting -- and, finally, a welcome bonus DVD containing the Stones p
EXTD=laying "Time Is On My Side" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, a li
EXTD=ve version of "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the S
EXTD=hadow?" from 1967, and the classic promo video for "Jumpin' Jack 
EXTD=Flash" from 1968, as well as an out-of-place 2003 video for the N
EXTD=eptunes' remix of "Sympathy for the Devil." While all these odds 
EXTD=and ends are nice to have, since they tie up any loose ends from 
EXTD=this era, the end result doesn't have the narrative flow or the r
EXTD=arities of the previous installments. That said, Singles 1968-197
EXTD=1 is a wonderful set for collectors, and it retains the high stan
EXTD=dard of the rest of the series.   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\n

EXTD=d promotional artwork.\n\nAlthough the "Jumpin' Jack Flash" B-sid
EXTD=e, "Child of the Moon," finds the Stones still attempting to keep
EXTD=pace with the Beatles (the song clearly echoes Lennon/McCartney'
EXTD=s "Rain"), the aforementioned A-side presents the group living up
EXTD=to their reputation as the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band wit

EXTD=nsitional period for the Stones, and the music reflects this, mos
EXTD=t notably in the country twang of "Honky Tonk Women" and the wist
EXTD=ful "Wild Horses." A particular treat for Jagger fans is the incl
EXTD=usion of his strutting "Memo from Turner" single, taken from the 
EXTD=film PERFORMANCE, along with the Ry Cooder instrumental "Natural 
EXTD=Magic." The set also includes a "Sympathy for the Devil" single u

EXTD=ER REVIEW\n"The London Years" Compared To The 3 "Singles" Box Set
EXTD=s, June 12, 2006 \nBy  Mark Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nThe pu
EXTD=rpose of this review is to completely compare the contents of "Si
EXTD=ngles Collection: The London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets w
EXTD=hich as a group contain the same songs plus more. There are some 
EXTD=good comparisons in the other reviews, but also several omissions
EXTD=and inaccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear
EXTD=things up a bit as to what songs are included on each, and which
EXTD="missing" songs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, parti
EXTD=cularly "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these
EXTD=collections is rather expensive, so hopefully this may help you 
EXTD=decide which sets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thin
EXTD=g first though, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP con
EXTD=tained in the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the
EXTD=full length CD "Got Live If You Want It". They share the same ti
EXTD=tle but that's all, and were actually two different releases. Buy
EXTD=ing the full length CD will NOT get you all the same songs on the
EXTD=EP as indicated in another review. With that out of the way.....
EXTD=\n\n"Singles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: The London Years" 
EXTD=contains all of the songs included in this box set, with the exce
EXTD=ption of 3 original British EP's exclusive to the box set. The fi
EXTD=rst EP contains You Better Move On (also available on "December's
EXTD=Children") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 also av
EXTD=ailable on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The secon
EXTD=d EP (originally titled "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Empty H
EXTD=eart, 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around
EXTD=and Around, all of which are also available on the "12 X 5" CD. Th
EXTD=e third EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contai
EXTD=ns early live versions of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Som
EXTD=ebody To Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alr
EXTD=ight, none of which are available on any other CD (with the possi
EXTD=ble exception of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same ver
EXTD=sion included on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusio
EXTD=n: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early 
EXTD=single/B-sides Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as we
EXTD=ll as I Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren
EXTD='t available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs 
EXTD=not included elsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP. So
EXTD=the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-6
EXTD=5" would appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "Sing
EXTD=les Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs inclu
EXTD=ded in this 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Both contain the sin
EXTD=gle/B-sides Long Long While and We Love You (also available on "Mor
EXTD=e Hot Rocks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which aren'
EXTD=t available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs n
EXTD=ot included elsewhere. No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1968-
EXTD=1971": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the
EXTD=songs included in this 3rd box set, with a few unique exceptions
EXTD=The third box set additionally contains Everybody Needs Somebod
EXTD=y to Love (also available on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and three
EXTD=non-ABKCO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-si
EXTD=des are the Ry Cooder instrumental Natural Magic (from the film "
EXTD=Performance" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bi
EXTD=tch and Sway which were the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. M
EXTD=y guess is the licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin
EXTD=Records, etc. and hadn't yet been negotiated when "The London Ye
EXTD=ars" was originally released back in 1989. The remixes appear to 
EXTD=be 3 different "rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The
EXTD=box set also contains a bonus DVD (see the item description for 
EXTD=more on that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singl
EXTD=es 68-71" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on
EXTD="More Hot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available 
EXTD=on "Hot Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between "The London Yea
EXTD=rs" and "Singles 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-
EXTD=sides, the three remixes and the DVD contained in the box set. \n
EXTD=\nFinal Conclusion: For the completest collector who has to have 
EXTD=absolutely everything on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Buy al
EXTD=l 3 box sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and t
EXTD=he two box sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of dupli
EXTD=cation, though "The London Years" runs a little cheaper than the 
EXTD=box sets and you don't have to change CD's as often). \n\nA slightl
EXTD=y cheaper option if you're mainly interested in completing the AB
EXTD=KCO Rolling Stones "canon" not released on the regular studio ful
EXTD=l-length CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" an
EXTD=d "Singles 1963-1965". You'd only be missing the three non-ABKCO 
EXTD=B-sides and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper o
EXTD=ption still, if you're only interested in the very early singles 
EXTD=& live EP and can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to b
EXTD=uy "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1
EXTD=965". With those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Y
EXTD=our Plane? and the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\n
EXTD=In truth, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London 
EXTD=Years" make an interesting listen because each is primarily made 
EXTD=up of A and B sides not included on the regular studio CD's. So the
EXTD=y're almost like listening to independent CD's without repeating 
EXTD=too many songs you'll hear when listening to the other albums. Th
EXTD=e 2nd disc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkl
EXTD=y (Big Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with different selections 
EXTD=of songs, so comparing these two further is highly recommended as
EXTD=well. \n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZON.CO
EXTD=M CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA real gem for collectors, March 3, 2005 \nBy 
EXTD=Greg Pearce\n\nThis is the third and final installment of box se
EXTD=ts covering the Stones singles released between 1963 - 1971. All 
EXTD=three box sets are a treasure for stones collectors because we ge
EXTD=t the original artwork for all the singles (and early EP's) that 
EXTD=the Stones released in the sixties. The cd's actually look like o
EXTD=ld 45's. This box set covering the years 1968 - 1971 has a cool b
EXTD=onus dvd with several live performances and the classic old Jumpi
EXTD=n' Jack Flash video. However, this series of box sets is not for 
EXTD=casual fans. The vast majority of songs can be found on the old L
EXTD=ondon Years box set which Abkco remastered in their 2002 Rolling 
EXTD=Stones remastered series. One omission on the singles 1968 - 1971
EXTD=box set is the live version of Let It Rock recorded at Leeds Uni
EXTD=versity in 1971 and originally released in the UK as the B side t
EXTD=o Brown Sugar is not included. Apparently this is because Virgin 
EXTD=owns the rights to that song. Bottom line is that all three singl
EXTD=es box sets are awesome if you want to have cd replicants of all 
EXTD=the original 45's and the early EP's with their original artwork.
