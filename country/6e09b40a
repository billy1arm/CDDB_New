EXTD=REVIEW: On their fourth album The Closer You Get, Alabama gets fu
EXTD=rther away from the country roots and down-home charm responsible
EXTD=for their incredible chart success. One may be surprised at the 
EXTD=unusual number of ballads, but popular country in the early '80s,
EXTD=in hindsight, seems more suited to adult easy listening than cou
EXTD=ntry with the popularity of Kenny Rogers, Crystal Gayle, and Doll
EXTD=y Parton. The songwriting is strong, and the vocal harmonies stil
EXTD=l blend unlike any other country band -- in fact, the members of 
EXTD=Alabama trade lead vocal roles throughout the album. However, thi
EXTD=s album suffers from glossy production and the use of synthesizer
EXTD=s. The use of a drum machine on the opening title track is nearly
EXTD=unforgivable, and the arrangement distracts the listener from an
EXTD=otherwise good song. However, Alabama shines when they use more 
EXTD=traditional country arrangements. Upbeat songs like "Red River" a
EXTD=nd "Dixieland Delight" are great additions to their catalog and d
EXTD=emonstrate how they became one of country's most successful group
EXTD=s. This is not the place to start, but most fans should eventuall
EXTD=y own this album.  -- Vik Iyengar\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW
EXTD=\nA must have for serious fans, May 13, 2006\nReviewer: Hwy. 275\n
EXTD=For anyone that is seriously a fan of Alabama, this album again p
EXTD=roves that the first 10 albums of Alabama are necessary to have a
EXTD=true and complete collection of the band. First, the full-length
EXTD=version of "The Closer You Get" is only available on this album.
EXTD=While "The Closer You Get" is not an Alabama original (originall
EXTD=y recorded in 1980 by Exile as a pop hit), it remains one of thei
EXTD=r most classic and unique songs. Toe-tapping "Dixieland Delight" 
EXTD=and the somber ballad "Lady Down On Love" also remain two of thei
EXTD=r most timeless hits. Songs like those prove how original the sou
EXTD=nd of Alabama was and still is today. \n\nAside from those three 
EXTD=songs, two other songs on the album that were never released as s
EXTD=ingles warrant special recognition. The first is their excellent 
EXTD=remake of "She Put The Sad In All His Songs", a song from the lat
EXTD=e 1970's that was covered by several artists including Ronnie Dun
EXTD=n of Brooks and Dunn fame. One of the finest songs on the album, it
EXTD=would have been a hit and could have been a classic had the song
EXTD=been extended with a long guitar solo and more generous string a
EXTD=rrangement, but still was recrafted into a distinct song. "Alabam
EXTD=a Sky", sung by Teddy Gentry is far from an inferior song as well
EXTD=and could have easily been a single as well. \n\nWhile these rec
EXTD=ommendations may not impress the passive fan who remembers only t
EXTD=heir biggest songs, any serious fan or collector of Alabama's mus
EXTD=ic should have this CD in their collection.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTO
EXTD=MER REVIEW\nPretty Good Stuff, September 29, 2002\nReviewer: Bren
EXTD=t H. Williams (Huntington, WV United States]\nMost of what Alabam
EXTD=a has done is simply great, they are one of the best country musi
EXTD=c groups to hit the scene. While this one is good, it kind of lac
EXTD=ks the "punch" that put them in the spotlight, rather, it shows t
EXTD=he more slow ballad style rather than up tempo. My two favorite s
EXTD=ongs would be the title cut "The Closer You Get", and "Dixieland 
EXTD=Delight". If you want a quiet evening to lie back, relax and list
EXTD=en, then this one will be what you need.\n\n\nHalf.com Album Note

EXTD=zes how truly original and groundbreaking this music once was - wi
EXTD=th THE CLOSER YOU GET (and other records from this period), Alaba
EXTD=ma essentially created a new breed of popular music, one that wou

EXTD=in.\nHighlights on this CD include "Lady Down on Love," "She Put 
EXTD=the Sad in All His Songs" and "What in the Name of Love." These s
EXTD=ongs revolve around classic themes of love and the lack of it. Ho
EXTD=wever, Randy Owens and the boys also perform songs with a stronge
EXTD=r rock edge too--examples of this include the title track and the
EXTD=album's closer, "Lovin' Man." Most of the songs on this record, 
EXTD=however, are delicate and lush. Replete with many fine ballads an
EXTD=d mellow country originals, THE CLOSER YOU GET helped redefine po
