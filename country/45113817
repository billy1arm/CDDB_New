EXTD=s accompany the lyrics -- Olivia with horses, Olivia in the hay, 
EXTD=Olivia with a doggy - following up the phenomenal success of Have 
EXTD=You Never Been Mellow was pretty elementary -- Newton-John ruled 
EXTD=the Top 40, adult contemporary, and country charts at this point 
EXTD=in time. From the end of 1975 to early 1976, Clearly Love generat
EXTD=ed a Top 20 and two Top 30 hits: "Something Better to Do" and "Le
EXTD=t It Shine" b/w "He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother," respectively.
EXTD=They both topped the adult contemporary charts while the flip of
EXTD="Let It Shine," a rare female-vocalist cover of "He Ain't Heavy.
EXTD=He's My Brother," also garnered radio and sales action. The cho
EXTD=ices for cover songs on this album are strange indeed: an unneces
EXTD=sary "Summertime Blues" which adds nothing to Eddie Cochran's son
EXTD=g of hot-weather angst and the interesting remake of the Hollies'
EXTD=hit "He Ain't Heavy," with its big country-ballad ending to what
EXTD=started as a lilting love song. The gems here are what sound lik
EXTD=e Olivia Newton-John bread-and-butter staples -- "Slow Down Jacks
EXTD=on," which is as bubbly and beautiful as "Have You Never Been Mel
EXTD=low" - "Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying" - the stunning title track
EXTD="Clearly Love" - along with, of course, the hits. "Let It Shine" 
EXTD=has lots of country twang -- John Farrar's impeccable production 
EXTD=was pretty much automatic after all their previous success. "Some
EXTD=thing Better to Do" might not be among her biggest hits, but the 
EXTD=class and style the Newton-John/Farrar team brought to the table 
EXTD=- a prime example being this title -- was very well-crafted pop 
EXTD=and set the stage for the movie soundtracks down the road, which 
EXTD=would bring her back to chart dominance. The transition from the 
EXTD=Linda Ronstadt soft rock of "Summertime Blues" to the harmonica-l
EXTD=aden "Just a Lot of Folk (The Marshmallow Song)" had Newton-John 
EXTD=covering all the bases. Very pleasant, inoffensive, and able to p
EXTD=ut the listener in a good mood, Clearly Love is a nice addition t
EXTD=o Newton-John's collection.  -- Joe Viglione \n\n\nAMG EXPERT REV
EXTD=IEW: (Come On Over)  Olivia Newton John's Come on Over is country
EXTD=tunes, folk ballads, and more. Her own arrangement and adaptatio
EXTD=n of the traditional "Greensleeves" is exquisite, haunting, and s
EXTD=hows Newton-John is more than just a pretty face. Her hit catalog
EXTD=was already nine songs deep, and "Come on Over" was the tenth of
EXTD=close to 30 visits to the Top 40 in a 14-year period. Fred Rose'
EXTD=s "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" and a cover of Dolly Parton's cl
EXTD=assic "Jolene" open and shut side one with the country side of th
EXTD=ings while the Diane Berglund/Jim Phillips composition "Pony Ride
EXTD=" is more of a piano ballad, nicely bridging the Western music wi
EXTD=th the song which would go to the top of the adult contemporary c
EXTD=harts, the brilliant title track written by Barry Gibb and Robin 
EXTD=Gibb of the Bee Gees. "Come on Over" came right on the heels of o
EXTD=ne of the Bee Gees' most brilliant compositions, "Fanny (Be Tende
EXTD=r With My Love)," charting just three months prior to "Come on Ov
EXTD=er." What this record becomes is a textbook on the separation bet
EXTD=ween what is good and what is great. The album is quality stuff t
EXTD=hrough and through, but even a good reading of a Beatles classic 
EXTD=like "The Long and Winding Road" pales next to the majesty of Joh
EXTD=n Farrar's simple production and Olivia's direct and heart-wrench
EXTD=ing vocal on the title track. It is so moving that every other pe
EXTD=rformance becomes a supporting act to the main attraction. It is 
EXTD=also the only song that charted on the Top 40 from this consisten
EXTD=t and entertaining project. "It'll Be Me" is the next best thing 
EXTD=to "Come on Over," a Hank Marvin/John Farrar composition showing 
EXTD=Newton-John's relationship to Cliff Richard's Shadows, drummer Br
EXTD=ian Bennett providing the backbeat. Cliff Richard had his biggest
EXTD=U.S. success up to this point in time with "Devil Woman" as this
EXTD=record was charting simultaneously. It would be four years until
EXTD=Olivia and Cliff's duet "Suddenly," from the Xanadu soundtrack, 
EXTD=made its splash. "Don't Throw It All Away" and "Who Are You Now?"
EXTD=are beautiful middle of the road performances here, and Farrar's
EXTD=production is really understated and sadly underrated. His grasp
EXTD=of the pop format is major league and worthy of note. Farrar's "
EXTD=Small Talk and Pride" and Harlan Collins' "Wrap Me in Your Arms" 
EXTD=are elegant and perfect in their construction. Olivia Newton-John
EXTD=was a superstar before Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, and as beau
EXTD=tiful as those pop divas can sing, it is John Farrar's understand
EXTD=ing of his artist which makes these albums by Olivia so heartfelt
EXTD=and magical. "Come on Over" is a tremendous song on a very good 
EXTD=album. More than just the Bee Gees meets the Shadows featuring Ol
EXTD=ivia Newton-John, Come on Over is a true pop classic.  -- Joe Vig

EXTD=ristopher Todd Durnil (Chicago, IL United States]\n\nThis is, per
EXTD=haps, Olivia's greatest vocal album. Coming off a string of count
EXTD=ry-oriented recordings, to which Olivia struck gold with "Let Me 
EXTD=Be There," "If You Love Me (Let Me Know)," "I Honestly Love You,"
EXTD="Please Mr. Please," and "Let It Shine," Olivia and producer Joh
EXTD=n Farrar decided to toss aside the airy vocals that Olivia had be
EXTD=en harshly criticized for (Listen to "Have You Never Been Mellow?
EXTD=") and record with an orchestra, vocals full front. The results a
EXTD=re breathtaking. The powerful first single, a cover of the Bee Ge
EXTD=es classic "Come On Over" (taken from their masterpiece "Main Cou
EXTD=rse") had Olivia front and center in a confrontational tone, and 
EXTD=her stirring vocals sailed up to #1 on the Adult Contemporary cha
EXTD=rts (Olivia was the #1 female AC artist of the 70's), and landed 
EXTD=top-20 on the pop charts. The album is filled with several songs 
EXTD=that could have easily become huge hits, but Olivia was broiled i
EXTD=n controversy at the time with the American country music genre (
EXTD=many major stars did not approve of this Aussie coming in and tak
EXTD=ing awards from such county queens as Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn
EXTD=, and Donna Fargo), so Olivia quickly went to Nashville and recor
EXTD=ded a speedy follow-up ("Don't Stop Believin'"), leaving "Come On
EXTD=Over" in the dust. Too bad, because it truly signalled a change 
EXTD=in her music and represents the best of her early albums. \n\nHig
EXTD=hlights include the pleading Dolly Parton cover "Jolene" (release
EXTD=d as a single worldwide, yet not in America), the beautiful "Pony
EXTD=Ride," the rocking "It'll Be Me, Babe," the haunting "Who Are Yo
EXTD=u Now?." Even more impressive is Olivia's stunning arrangement of
EXTD=the centurys-old "Greensleeves," and her beguiling take on the B
EXTD=eatles' classic "The Long and Winding Road," which is perhaps one
EXTD=of the greatest covers of a Beatles song ever. Any one of them c
EXTD=ould have been huge hits. All are amazing in their breadth. \n\nF
EXTD=or anyone wanting a great glimpse of pre-Grease Olivia, this is t

EXTD=VIEW (Come On Over]\nOlivia comes good in time., August 31, 2007 
EXTD=\nBy  bobby morrow "Bobby Morrow" (United Kingdom]\n\nWhen 'Come 
EXTD=On Over' was released in the spring of 1976, Olivia Newton-John w
EXTD=as struggling to keep up the momentum of earlier hits such as 'Ha
EXTD=ve You Never Been Mellow' and 'I Honestly Love You'. Releasing 2 
EXTD=albums a year had meant quality control had suffered and perhaps 
EXTD=Olivia was becoming over-familiar. \n\nThe title track was the le
EXTD=ad single, in fact I believe it was the only UK and US release fr
EXTD=om this set. It's a cover of a Bee Gees track (from their 1975 al
EXTD=bum 'Main Course') and is one of the highlights of this album. Ho
EXTD=wever, as lovely as it is, it's not really strong enough to sell 
EXTD=an album big time. It made #23 in the US charts which is OK, but 
EXTD=it's not a song that is really remembered by Olivia. \n\nThis alb
EXTD=um, produced again by John Farrar, continues the theme of her pre
EXTD=vious long-players, a few covers mixed with a couple of originals
EXTD=by Farrar and other writers. \n\nThe opening track, 'Jolene' is 
EXTD=excellent. Totally different to Dolly Parton's original, Olivia r
EXTD=eally lets fly with this and the song is possibly the high point 
EXTD=of the whole album. Olivia's take on 'Greensleeves' is ill-advise
EXTD=d as is her version of 'The Long And Winding Road' which is over 
EXTD=4 minutes of Olivia whinging and simpering, though, to her credit
EXTD=, she does manage not to nod off... \n\nOne of the main flaws, if
EXTD=that's the word, of this album is that it's very ballad heavy. I
EXTD=remember being quite disappointed with it when I first purchased
EXTD=it. Even I, as young as I was then, could see few hits on it. \n
EXTD=\nGary Benson's minor UK hit, 'Don't Throw It All Away' is anothe
EXTD=r goodie and Farrar's 'Small Talk And Pride' stands out too. Oliv
EXTD=ia gets a little funky on 'It'll Be Me' though I've never been ov
EXTD=er fond of the song. \n\nThe good thing about 'Come On Over' is t
EXTD=hat 31 years later, I've really come to appreciate it. The produc
EXTD=tion is beautiful and Olivia was rarely in better voice. Her next
EXTD=album, 'Don't Stop Believin' saw her record in Nashville for the
EXTD=first time and is a more varied collction than this but 'Come On
EXTD=Over' more than holds it's own as one of Olivia's better albums 
EXTD=of the 70's. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW (Come On Over]\nTep
EXTD=id middle-of-the-road from a fine vocalist, April 1, 2003 \nBy  C
EXTD=hris "Glitterama" (Sydney, Australia]\n\nTake that subject line a
EXTD=s you will. It is neither offensive, nor congratulatory. 'Come On
EXTD=Over' came during a period in Olivia's career where she was chur
EXTD=ning out records faster than a large African nation produces chil
EXTD=dren. Her music is predominantly called 'country', but I often fe
EXTD=el that this was an incorrect tag Olivia got stuck with. Despite 
EXTD=a few residing melodies or a twangy guitar here and there, Olivia
EXTD='s music around this period is more easy-listening light pop than
EXTD=anything else.\nHowever, my personal bias against the term 'coun
EXTD=try' aside. 'Come On Over' was her first album of 1976, following
EXTD=two in 1975 (namely 'Clearly Love' and 'Have You Been Mellow'). 
EXTD=By the end of the ensuing year she would have released two more s
EXTD=tudio albums and a greatest hits compilation. It has to be said t
EXTD=hat 'Come On Over' is not really the pick of the litter. Like man
EXTD=y artists at the time, 'Come On Over' contains a few blindingly g
EXTD=ood songs and the rest becomes average filler. Of course with Oli
EXTD=via's freakishly perfect voice wrapped around the melodies, this 
EXTD='filler' sounds remarkably good - but still. Filler is filler.\n\n
EXTD=The album opens with a bang via Dolly Parton's thigh-slappin' cou
EXTD=ntry rocker 'Jolene'. Olivia's version is infinitely better than 
EXTD=Dolly's, with a multitude of ear-piercingly high vocals and fanta
EXTD=stic treatment of the lyrics. It is actually one of Olivia's best
EXTD=known tunes down here in Australia, for what reason I am not sur
EXTD=e but there you go. Useless fact of the day. Track 2 is 'Pony Rid
EXTD=e', one of the most atmospheric and beautiful ballads of Olivia's
EXTD=entire catalogue. I would go so far as to say it is the best voc
EXTD=al performance she ever gave, but with so many songs to choose fr
EXTD=om I fear I'd be doing some other gem too big an injustice. The t
EXTD=hird track on the disc is the Bee Gees penned title track, a beau
EXTD=tiful song which Olivia still says is one of her favourite songs 
EXTD=and often performs it acoustically on tour. A real chance to show
EXTD=off the pipes here, this is Olivia at her mid-tempo best. 'Who A
EXTD=re You Now' is a gorgeous Olivia ballad which epitomises why she 
EXTD=was so successful in the seventies, she does a fine job of the Be
EXTD=atles' 'Long And Winding Road', and 'It'll Be Me' at least inject
EXTD=s a bit of late-night uptempo jazz into the mix.\n\nUnfortunately
EXTD=you also have have pointless covers of the bluegrass 'Blue Eyes 
EXTD=Crying In The Rain' and 'Greensleeves' and a handful of middling 
EXTD=ballads. Most Olivia fans will admit that she has done a lot of b
EXTD=etter songs than half the tunes included on this album.\n\n'Come 
EXTD=On Over' is not a bad album, but it is not a particularly memorab
EXTD=le one. Luckily the price here at Amazon is so ridiculously low i
EXTD=t won't break the bank balance too much, but if you are new to Ol
