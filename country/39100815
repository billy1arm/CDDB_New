EXTD=ng from a spring 1977 showcase starts off on a strong note, with 
EXTD=Hank Thompson and His Brazos Valley Boys, and gets better from ther
EXTD=e. Thompson's five numbers are as strong as any of the live perfo
EXTD=rmances that have surfaced from previous decades, with the added 
EXTD=advantage of incredibly good sound, which makes this an important
EXTD=addition to any collection of his work. Freddy Fender represents
EXTD=a different but no less compelling side of country music, and is
EXTD=in equally good form. Roy Clark's set is just a river of fun, fl
EXTD=owing with the kind of instrumental virtuosity -- on the electric
EXTD=guitar, banjo, and acoustic guitar -- that, at Carnegie Hall, is
EXTD=usually reserved for classical performers and their instruments.
EXTD=And finally, Don Williams closes out the recording with his achi
EXTD=ngly lyrical singing, laced with a lean instrumental sound that r
EXTD=epresents the countrypolitan sound at its best. The Varese CD rei
EXTD=ssue contains one bonus track, Roy Clark doing "Yesterday, When I
EXTD=Was Young" -- it's as good as anything else here, and why it was
EXTD=left off the original release is anyone's guess.  -- Bruce Eder\n

EXTD=he floorboards of Carnegie Hall - Flatt and Scruggs played there in
EXTD=1962 at the height of the early '60s folk boom, and Buck Owens r
EXTD=ecorded his landmark live album there in 1966. Even with Country 
EXTD=music's relative scarcity in this iconic hall of sophistication, 
EXTD=New Yorkers prove themselves (as they did on Owens' recording) as
EXTD=happy to hoot and holler as their Southern relations might be at
EXTD=an Opry broadcast. \n\nUnlike the solo appearances of Flatt and Sc
EXTD=ruggs and Buck Owens, this 1977 date was an ABC-Dot package that 
EXTD=featured four headliners, representing different eras of country 
EXTD=music and stages in their careers. Hank Thompson opens the show, 
EXTD=recounting his two biggest hits ("Wild Side of Life" and "A Six P
EXTD=ack to Go"), as well as his Western Swing beginnings ("Oklahoma H
EXTD=ills"). Freddy Fender appears at the peak of his popular fame. Ha
EXTD=ving recovered from career detours in the '60s, Fender hit with a
EXTD=remake of "Before the Next Teardrop Falls," and a remake of his 
EXTD=own "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights." In addition to the hits, he 
EXTD=dips into the Hank Williams catalog for a Spanish-English take of
EXTD="Jambalaya." \n\nThird up is multi-instrumentalist Roy Clark. Li
EXTD=ke Buck Owens, Clark's image was defined in the '70s more by his 
EXTD=hosting slot on "Hee Haw" than by his records. Still, he cut an e
EXTD=nduring cover of Charles Aznavour's "Yesterday, When I Was Young"
EXTD=(represented here by a 1972 live recording) and continued to daz
EXTD=zle audiences with his instrumental skills. Pickin' highlights in
EXTD=clude Clark's guitar playing on "Under the Double Eagle" and "Mal
EXTD=aguena," and bandleader Buck Trent's banjo on "Banjo Buck." Croon
EXTD=er Don Williams closes the CD, reprising many of his gentle, char
EXTD=t-topping ballads, accompanied by bass and guitar. His singer-son
EXTD=gwriter approach sounds the most contemporary in this mid-70s set
EXTD=ting, and the audience responds (to both his music and his low-ke
EXTD=y humor) with sing-along enthusiasm. \n\nOriginally released as a
EXTD=double LP on ABC/Dot, this is a nice reminder of a time when per
