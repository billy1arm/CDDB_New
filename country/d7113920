EXTD=bluegrass material. "The Three Bells" was the massive hit that t
EXTD=urned the trio toward pop material in 1959. Their repertory on Di
EXTD=sc Three was broadening to include more overt folk material and p
EXTD=op standards. By the time of Disc Four, Hank Garland and John D. 
EXTD=Loudermilk were playing most of the guitar, though Atkins was sti
