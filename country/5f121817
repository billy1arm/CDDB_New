EXTD=ed October 17, 1995\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Four CDs covering Marty
EXTD=Robbins' complete Western recordings, 99 songs in all from 1958 
EXTD=until 1979. As a concept, Under Western Skies is cohesive and enj
EXTD=oyable, largely because Robbins' music, regardless of the particu
EXTD=lar year in which it was recorded, is unified thematically. It's 
EXTD=also a superb showcase for Robbins' voice, one of the most versat
EXTD=ile in country and western -- he was equally adept at rock and roll, 
EXTD=traditional country, or Western ballads dating back 100 years or 
EXTD=more, but he had a way of extending the latter genre's melodic be
EXTD=auty and lyricism without ever seeming repetitive. Thus, it wasn'
EXTD=t just that Robbins was covering this repertory, but that he was 
EXTD=doing it in ways that, as a solo artist of his era, were just abo
EXTD=ut definitive. Disc One contains songs from Gunfighter Ballads an
EXTD=d Trail Songs and parts of the follow-up record, More Gunfighter 
EXTD=Ballads and Trail Songs. Disc Two is devoted to songs from Return
EXTD=of the Gunfighter and the rest of More Gunfighter Ballads, fille
EXTD=d out with songs that only appeared previously in 1984 on a Bear 
EXTD=Family vinyl release. By the mid-'60s, Robbins' voice was even be
EXTD=tter, richer and more confident on this material, and Disc Three 
EXTD=reflects this. Disc Four extends up through 1979, and it's someth
EXTD=ing of a tribute to Robbins' success with this repertory that pre
EXTD=cious little was left in the vaults for Bear Family or anyone els
EXTD=e to unearth and issue for the first time. The accompanying bookl
EXTD=et is 60 pages long, and while it does seem as though the essay i

EXTD=ng in one box., April 17, 2000 \nReviewer: A music fan from Garla
EXTD=nd, Texas  \nMarty Robbins had a remarkably varied career, singin
EXTD=g everything from mainstream country to Hawaiian music with equal
EXTD=aplomb. His most engaging work, however, was with Western music.
EXTD=Whether writing his own material or interpreting traditional fav
EXTD=orites and contemporary classics, Marty was clearly at home on th
EXTD=e range. Now, Bear Family has gathered every western song Marty e
EXTD=ver cut into one terrific box set. The price tag may be a bit off
EXTD=putting to casual fans, but anyone who has worn out a copy of Gu
EXTD=nfighter Ballads and Trail Songs will be delighted to find that a
EXTD=lmost every track on each of the four CDs included here is of tha
EXTD=t same high quality. More importantly, this set is the only way t
