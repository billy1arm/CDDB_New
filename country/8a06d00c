EXTD=Edition Released June 2, 2008\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Only the Gr
EXTD=eatest as a title may have two meanings: the first implies the mu
EXTD=sic included here, and the second implies the artist. There is a 
EXTD=case to be made for the latter, but in the case of the former, th
EXTD=is is only partially true. Had this compilation been called "Some
EXTD=of the Greatest," it would have been dead on. Waylon Jennings wa
EXTD=s one of the most evocative country music artists ever produced. 
EXTD=In his long career he did everything his own way, no matter what 
EXTD=it cost him. The 12 songs on this budget collection are a testame
EXTD=nt to the greatness of his mature period as an artist. These are 
EXTD=the singles and album tracks recorded during the 1960s when Jenni
EXTD=ngs had actively gone to war with his label about using his own b
EXTD=and in the studio and recording the material he chose, not his pr
EXTD=oducers or label A&R men. Hardcore Waylon fans will already have 
EXTD=all of this stuff, but for the beginner, there is a solid if mini
EXTD=mal education to be had about this period in the singer's career 
EXTD=where he was a hit within the genre, but nobody else knew who he 
EXTD=was. His readings of Neil Diamond's "Kentucky Woman" and Bobby Ba
EXTD=re's "Such a Waste of Love," offer the power of his voice in a se
EXTD=tting that was equal parts honky tonk, folk, rock, and even pop. 
EXTD=Each track here is a winner, from the best known, such as "Only D
EXTD=addy That'll Walk the Line" to the least, such as Harlan Howard's
EXTD=underappreciated classic "California Sunrise."  -- Thom Jurek\n\n
