EXTD=stern music may live forever, but in the early '60s it had alread
EXTD=y suffered a decline. The singing cowboys had all but disappeared
EXTD=from the silver screen, and the days when western attire and rep
EXTD=ertoire were expected of country artists would soon be over. The 
EXTD=album format became the new domain of commercial western music, a
EXTD=nd stalwarts like the Sons of the Pioneers and Tex Ritter continu
EXTD=ed to release moderately successful albums long after their hitma
EXTD=king heydays. Eddy Arnold had a number one hit in 1955 with one o
EXTD=f his recordings of "Cattle Call," but this 1963 LP was his first
EXTD=all-western album and his first to make the Billboard album char
EXTD=ts. In addition to the expected western standards on Cattle Call,
EXTD=Arnold "westernizes" popular songs like "The Wayward Wind," and 
EXTD=his smooth baritone fits these songs just as well as that of Rex 
EXTD=Allen or Johnny Western. The re-recording of the title track is a
EXTD=haunting beauty with a real yodel rather than the falsetto vocal
EXTD=treatment it often receives, and is the version that is frequent
EXTD=ly anthologized even though it wasn't a hit. Well made and well r
EXTD=emembered, Cattle Call is perhaps the most significant western al
EXTD=bum of the '60s.  -- Greg Adams\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Descripti
EXTD=on\nAll Music Guide calls this album "perhaps the most significan
EXTD=t western album of the '60s," and you'd be hard-pressed to argue 
EXTD=when you hear Eddy's ethereal yodel on the title tune, or his tak

EXTD=One Of Eddy Arnold's Very Very Best, October 1, 2007 \nBy  Michae
EXTD=l G. Batcho (McAdoo, PA (USA)]\n\n"CATTLE CALL" . . . I remember 
EXTD=so clearly the day back in 1963 when i received this LP in the ma
EXTD=il from RCA's Record Club . . . i always loved "cowboy songs of t
EXTD=he west" (probably every kid growing up in the 50's in America wa
EXTD=tched every cowboy on television and heard the songs of the west)
EXTD=. . . so when i plopped the vinyl LP onto the stereo turntable a
EXTD=nd heard that golden voice of Eddy Arnold deliver these ballads i
EXTD=t was like visiting "familiar territory". \n\nEddy recorded and r
EXTD=e-recorded the title song "CATTLE CALL" many times, but the rendi
EXTD=tion of it he put down on THIS album is perfect and crystal-clear
EXTD=. . .when he hits that Eddy Arnold yodel "hoo-hoo-hoo-hoohooo" y
EXTD=ou just have to try to sing along with him (even if you can't rea
EXTD=ch the notes that Eddy did) . . . this song and this recording ha
EXTD=s held up remarkably as a classic and never ever loses its magic 
EXTD=or appeal no matter how often you play it or hear it. \n\nThe tra
EXTD=cks are all great: "The Streets Of Loredo" . . . "Cool Water" . .
EXTD=. "The Wayward Wind" . . . "Carry Me back To The Lone Prarie" (O
EXTD=h Bury Me Not On The Lone Prarie) . . . "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" . 
EXTD=. \n\nBut two of my favorites are: "Where The Mountains Meet Th
EXTD=e Sky" which talks about a cowboy heading off into that sunset of
EXTD=eternity. \n\nAnd - "Jim, I Wore A Tie Today"(the first one that 
EXTD=i ever wore) . . . a song about burying an old friend and travell
EXTD=ing companion. \n\nI guess the old west had countless "sad storie
EXTD=s" to tell, and nothing told them better than a song . . . and fe
EXTD=w ever sag the songs better than did EDDY ARNOLD . . . and this a
EXTD=lbum is among Eddy's very very best! \n\nI was thrilled to first 
EXTD=get it and hear it on LP back in 1963 when i was just fifteen . .
EXTD=. and it is such a blessing to be able to listen to it now in pr
EXTD=istince crystal clear CD format and quality. "Old Cowboys never d
EXTD=ie . . . they don't fade away . . . they live on compact disc!" :
EXTD=) \n\nThanks EDDY ARNOLD for sharing so much of your talent with 
EXTD=us through your performances and recordings over the decades, and
EXTD=thanks for THIS album, "CATTLE CALL"! It is one i will alway enj
EXTD=oy and appreciate and cherish. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n

EXTD=ould like to echo the 5-star raves of critics who have commented 
EXTD=before me, but from the standpoint of a 40-year old yankee record
EXTD=junkie who has continued to return to this record from a giant a
EXTD=nd extensively diverse collection (2,000+ records) through the do

EXTD=erstand the mood which is satisfied by the soothing calm which Ed
EXTD=dy's basso intoning these great western tales (never mind those i
EXTD=ncredible yodels!), nothing else will do. A uniquely appealing re
EXTD=cord that I would insist must be included in any collection that 
EXTD=would call dare to make a claim to being comprehensive. It is a s
EXTD=hort list of $14 items which can bring you this much pleasure.
