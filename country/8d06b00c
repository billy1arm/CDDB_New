EXTD=Originally Released April 4, 1988 \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: In 1988 -- 25 ye
EXTD=ars after Patsy Cline's untimely death at the age of 30 -- MCA released t
EXTD=his collection of previously unreleased Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, which 
EXTD=span 1956-1962. Even if Live at the Opry had been extremely disappointing
EXTD=, there would have been an audience for this 28-minute CD. Cline, after a
EXTD=ll, went down in history as one of country's all-time greats (despite hav
EXTD=ing a much too short career), and her more obsessive fans would have welc
EXTD=omed the arrival of this release regardless of the quality. But Live at t
EXTD=he Opry is a generally rewarding, if imperfect and brief, document of Cli
EXTD=ne's performances at Nashville's most prestigious venue. The sound qualit
EXTD=y isn't always first-rate - at times, the sound is a bit scratchy for late
EXTD='50s and early-'60s recordings. But the sound is never bad -- only imper
EXTD=fect -- and Cline is in fine form on inspired performances of hits like "
EXTD=Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces," "She's Got You," and "Walkin' After Midnight.
EXTD=" Cline was never a country purist, but to people who appreciate a broade
EXTD=r, more expansive view of country, she was an impressive example of someo
EXTD=ne who truly pushed the genre's boundaries. A wide variety of influences 
EXTD=assert themselves on Live at the Opry, including rock and roll, jazz, torch
EXTD=singing, traditional pop, and Tin Pan Alley. Country was Cline's foundat
EXTD=ion, but that didn't prevent her from being affected (either directly or 
EXTD=indirectly) by the contributions of Billie Holiday, Jo Stafford, and Ella
EXTD=Fitzgerald. Those with a casual interest in Cline's legacy would be bett
EXTD=er off with a collection of her best-known studio recordings, but for the
EXTD=seasoned Cline enthusiast, Live at the Opry has a lot to offer -- imperf
EXTD=ections and all.  -- Alex Henderson\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNot 
EXTD=really a "concert" per se, tunes date from 1956-1962, July 22, 2005 \nBy 
EXTD=Greg Brady "columbusboy" (Capital City]\nThe songs here come from so-cal
EXTD=led "transcription" discs. These 16 inch discs were furnished to every st
EXTD=ation with rights to broadcast "Prince Albert Opry Show" aired live Satur
EXTD=day nights on the NBC radio network (and whenever they were able for the 
EXTD=stations that couldn't catch a live feed and used the transcriptions inst
EXTD=ead.) The recordings themselves were recorded by Opry house engineers. Th
EXTD=e recordings here come from 1956,1957,1960,1961, and 1962. It's interesti
EXTD=ng to note, as the liners point out, that at the time the first two track
EXTD=s were recorded Patsy had not had a national hit, so it was unusual that 
EXTD=she was given the coveted "guest artist" slot as a show of faith by the O
EXTD=pry. (To give you an idea, the week before it was Flatt and Scruggs, the 
EXTD=week after Johnny Horton). In January of 1960 she was made an Opry castme
EXTD=mber, though she'd still only had 1 chart hit ("Walkin' after Midnight") 
EXTD=\n\nRecordings are dated as follows: Cuts 1 and 2 6/16/1956, cut 3 12/14/
EXTD=1957, cut 4 4/2/1960, cut 5 4/29/1960, cuts 6 and 7 8/12/1960, cut 8 9/3/
EXTD=1960, cuts 9 and 10 7/7/1961, and cuts 11 and 12 3/23/1962. Since these w
EXTD=ere recorded live at the Opry many of these feature introductions from th
EXTD=e Opry hosts of the time: Little Jimmy Dickens, Ray Price, Jim Reeves, an
EXTD=d Hank Snow. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: \nThough her earliest performances are wonde
EXTD=rful, you can note the effect a solid chart hit has on an audience...witn
EXTD=ess the cheers as she performs "Walkin' after Midnight" (which had just h
EXTD=it #3 country and #12 pop). The yodeling tour-de-force on Hank Williams' 
EXTD="Lovesick Blues" is something to hear. Witness her snarl out the line "I'
EXTD=ve grown so used to that man somehow" and how she holds the prolonged fin
EXTD=al note. Stellar. Cline turns in an impassioned performance on Carl Smith
EXTD='s 1955 hit "There She Goes" (with the gender changed, naturally). Some b
EXTD=arrelhouse piano underlays "Lovin' in Vain". If you want to hear more spa
EXTD=re versions of Patsy's biggest hits, "I Fall to Pieces","Crazy" and "She'
EXTD=s Got You" all have more steel than the released versions, no six-string 
EXTD=bass, and without the reverb on the Bradley productions. \n\nBOTTOM LINE:
EXTD=\nIf you're already a Patsy fan, the sound quality on this is pretty goo
EXTD=d for vinyl sources. (A little bit of surface noise and "crackle" may be 
EXTD=heard here and there but it's surprisingly good.) Keep in mind, though, w
EXTD=hat's here is short: less than a half hour of songs total. You may want t
EXTD=o opt for a used copy. \n\n3 1/2 stars \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n
EXTD=A Great CD, January 30, 2001 \nBy  J. McManus Jr. "elpat" (Laurel, MD Uni
EXTD=ted States]\nThis a live album recorded at the Grand Old Opry through a s
EXTD=eries of dates. The recording are sparse, which is a good thing because i
EXTD=t really shows the strength of Patsy's voice. This one of the few collect
EXTD=ions you'll find where the tracks feature both parts of her career, as th
EXTD=e honky-tonk girl and the balladeer. Not for the first time listener, but
EXTD=definitely for fans. \n\n\nHalf.com Details \nContributing artists: Hank
EXTD=Snow, Jim Reeves \nProducer: The Country Music Foundation \n\nAlbum Note
EXTD=s\nRecorded between 1956 and 1962. \nIncludes liner notes by Jay Orr.\n\n
EXTD=Many of these tracks originate from radio transcriptions made by Grand Ol
EXTD=e Opry engineers for national syndication. LIVE AT THE OPRY collects 12 a
EXTD=ppearances across the span of the singer's career, beginning with "A Chur
EXTD=ch, A Courtroom, and Then Goodbye," recorded at the Opry in 1956, a year 
EXTD=before at Cline's first ever recording session.\nThings get progressively
EXTD=more interesting as the collection reaches the early 1960s, when Cline's
EXTD=studio recordings were becoming poppier. The version of "I Fall To Piece
EXTD=s" heard here amounts to a stripped-down version of the tune, with Cline 
EXTD=and the Jordanaires singing over bass, brushes, piano, and a few steel gu
EXTD=itar fills. Earlier tunes help convey what the excitement was all about w
EXTD=hen Cline performed her more rocking material live in the late '50s.This 
EXTD=collection includes detailed liner notes as well as providing performance
EXTD=dates.
