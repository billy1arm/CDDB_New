EXTD=EVIEW: ("Both Sides Of An Evening") Both Sides of an Evening is u
EXTD=sually cited as the place where the Everly Brothers' music and ca
EXTD=reer started to go wrong. Their relationship with their longtime 
EXTD=producer and publisher, Wesley Rose, had fallen apart in late 196
EXTD=0 amid a conflict over copyrights, specifically their decision to
EXTD=record as a single an old Nacio Herb Brown/Arthur Freed song cal
EXTD=led "Temptation" that he didn't publish. Cut off from their regul
EXTD=ar source of songs, Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who were Rose-pu
EXTD=blished composers, were left to their own devices as songwriters,
EXTD=with the complication that they were also signed to Rose and the
EXTD=re were now pending lawsuits in the relationship. Finding potenti
EXTD=al hits in such circumstances, much less a dozen good songs at a 
EXTD=time to record, was a serious challenge. Their answer was an albu
EXTD=m consisting of rhythm numbers on side one ("For Dancing") and sl
EXTD=ow ballads ("For Dreaming") on side two. Most of the first side -
EXTD=apart from the unfortunate decision to record "Mention My Name 
EXTD=in Sheboygan" -- worked beautifully, their version of "Muskrat" e
EXTD=ven getting a kind of shimmering Bo Diddley-style "shave and a ha
EXTD=ircut" beat, and the duo even put a fresh (and unexpected rock) s
EXTD=pin on the Al Jolson number "My Mammy." Side two is very soft for
EXTD=a rock and roll album and isn't helped by the presence of "Hi-Lili
EXTD=, Hi-Lo" and "Little Old Lady," though it is sung so beautifully 
EXTD=that any of the group's teenaged fans that listened to it all the
EXTD=way through couldn't complain of the singing. In some ways, Both
EXTD=Sides of an Evening was the duo's most ambitious and mature reco
EXTD=rd to date, but it just wasn't terribly exciting or of much inter
EXTD=est (especially the second side) to the teeenagers that made up t
EXTD=he vast bulk of their audience. -- Bruce Eder\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIE
EXTD=W: ("Instant Party") Instant Party isn't very highly regarded as 
EXTD=an Everly Brothers album, for the good reason that it showed the 
EXTD=Everlys stepping outside of their rock and roll personas. Apart fro
EXTD=m the crisply played and sung opening track, "Step It Up and Go" 
EXTD=- which had been suggested by Ike Everly -- and a few minor brig
EXTD=ht spots such as "True Love" and "Ground Hawg" (another Ike Everl
EXTD=y-spawned track), the material was pretty dire, confined almost e
EXTD=ntirely to the pop standards of another era, including such chest
EXTD=nuts as "Bye Bye Blackbird," "Autumn Leaves," and "Oh! My Pa-Pa."
EXTD=It was sung well enough, and much of the playing was impeccable,
EXTD=but also, apart from three exceptions, incredibly boring, someth
EXTD=ing the Everlys had never been before. Instant Party marked a low
EXTD=point in their artistic fortunes yet, ironically, even as they w
EXTD=ere delivering it to Warner Bros., the Everlys were recording sin
EXTD=gles such as "Crying in the Rain," which represented their sound 
EXTD=and their work far better. -- Bruce Eder
