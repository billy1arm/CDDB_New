EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW: (This Compilation) In early 2006, roughly in t
EXTD=ime for the 40th anniversary of Merle Haggard's debut album, Capi
EXTD=tol Nashville launched an ambitious Haggard catalog project, reis
EXTD=suing ten albums as a series of five two-fers, each adorned with 
EXTD=bonus tracks. All these albums had been reissued before, either s
EXTD=tateside by Capitol or Koch or in the U.K. by EMI or BGO, but the
EXTD=y've never have been given such an excellent treatment as they ar
EXTD=e here. The albums are paired together in logical, chronological 
EXTD=order, the 24-bit digital remastering gives these recordings the 
EXTD=best sound they've ever had, the front cover artwork is reproduce
EXTD=d for each album on a two-fer, and the liner notes are candid and
EXTD=detailed. Dedicated Hag fans certainly have nearly all this mate
EXTD=rial in their collection -- not only have the albums been on CD, 
EXTD=but the bonus tracks have by and large appeared on Bear Family's 
EXTD=box Untamed Hawk, which chronicled his early work for Capitol, or
EXTD=showed up on Capitol's own box, Down Every Road -- but they stil
EXTD=l may be tempted by this series, since these discs not only sound
EXTD=and look terrific, but they're also more listenable than any pre
EXTD=vious CD incarnation of these classic albums.\n\nAnd make no mist
EXTD=ake, all ten albums featured in Capitol Nashville's first wave of
EXTD=Haggard reissues in February 2006 are classic albums - some may b
EXTD=e a little stronger than others, but there's not a weak one in th
EXTD=e bunch, and they all stand as some of the finest music of their 
EXTD=time. The fifth two-fer of the initial wave paired Merle's two 19
EXTD=71 albums, Hag and Someday We'll Look Back, two terrific, reflect
EXTD=ive records. Arriving after the superb Bob Wills salute Tribute t
EXTD=o the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World, Hag was Haggard's fir
EXTD=st collection of largely original songs in two years, since 1969'
EXTD=s Portrait. Since that album, Haggard experienced great success w
EXTD=ith "Okie from Muskogee," which launched two quick live albums (o
EXTD=ne bearing the name of the song, the other being The Fightin' Sid
EXTD=e of Me), plus an instrumental album by the Strangers, before the
EXTD=labor of love of the Wills album. Perhaps Haggard had a great st
EXTD=ock of songs saved up during those two years, because Hag is one 
EXTD=of his absolute best albums -- which means a lot, because he reco
EXTD=rded no shortage of great records. In contrast to the rowdy live 
EXTD=albums and the raucous Western swing that preceded it, Hag is qui
EXTD=te quiet and reflective, sometimes referencing the turmoil within
EXTD=America at the end of the '60s, but more often finding Haggard t
EXTD=urning inward. This album turned out no less than four hits, with
EXTD=three of them addressing larger issues: the revival of Ernest Tu
EXTD=bb's WWII hit "Soldier's Last Letter" is now cast in the shadow o
EXTD=f Vietnam, Haggard's original "Jesus, Take a Hold" ponders the st
EXTD=ate of the world, while Dave Kirby's "Sidewalks of Chicago" is ab
EXTD=out homelessness. The other hit was "I Can't Be Myself," a haunti
EXTD=ng admission that the singer "can't be myself when I'm with you,"
EXTD=and it's only one of many great originals on Hag. The tempo pick
EXTD=s up twice, each time at the end of the side, when he kicks out t
EXTD=he self-deprecating "I'm a Good Loser" and the nostalgic rave-up 
EXTD="I've Done It All," but the heart of this is in the gentler mater
EXTD=ial, such as the melancholic elegy of "Shelly's Winter Love," the
EXTD=sighing heartbreak ballad "If You've Got Time," and "The Farmer'
EXTD=s Daughter," an affecting tale of a father giving away his daught
EXTD=er in marriage. Each is an expertly observed, richly textured gem
EXTD=, and taken together they add up to one of Haggard's best albums,
EXTD=and one of his most moving. \n\nSomeday We'll Look Back follows 
EXTD=through on the spirit of Hag. Like that record, much of Someday W
EXTD=e'll Look Back is devoted to ballads, including both lush, string
EXTD=laden country-pop crossovers and simple, folky tunes, but there 
EXTD=are also hints of twangy Bakersfield honky tonk and blues, as wel
EXTD=l as Western swing. But what really makes the record so distincti
EXTD=ve is the quality of the material. Haggard's original songs -- in
EXTD=cluding "Someday We'll Look Back," the richly evocative "Tulare D
EXTD=ust," "I'd Rather Be Gone," "One Sweet Hello" -- are uniformly ex
EXTD=cellent, while he invests considerable emotion into covers of Tom
EXTD=my Collins' "Carolyn," Dallas Frazier and Elizabeth Montgomery's 
EXTD="California Cottonfields," and Roger Miller's "Train of Life." Th
EXTD=e result is one of the finest albums he ever recorded, and when i
EXTD=t's paired with Hag on this two-fer, it makes for absolutely esse
EXTD=ntial listening.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n
