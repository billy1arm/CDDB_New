EXTD=This LP is worth seeking out -- as so many of Porter Wagoner's a
EXTD=re -- just for the cover, which shows him with reverse Grecian fo
EXTD=rmula in his hair, dressed in skid row clothes, standing outside 
EXTD=the old Ryman circa 1970, with an empty pint bottle behind him, h
EXTD=at in hand, looking insane. It's funnier than hell. Like "The Rub
EXTD=ber Room" from the mid-'60s, this is a theme album on the horrors
EXTD=, reasons, and solutions for drinking. As Skid Row Joe himself pu
EXTD=ts it in the liner notes: "Here are some thoughts and sights that
EXTD=go on in a wino's mind -- a man that drinks to ease the pain." T
EXTD=here are the amazing spoken word dialogues such as Wagoner's own 
EXTD="The Silent Kind," delivered in the first person, or "The Sidewal
EXTD=ks of Chicago" written by Dave Kirby, which was a minor hit for M
EXTD=erle Haggard in the '60s. There's also a stunning version of Doll
EXTD=y Parton's gem "The Alley" that Wagoner delivers without irony or
EXTD=humor, but stark, blistering emotion. On the flip Wagoner does j
EXTD=ustice to two more Parton songs, "One More Dime" and the closer, 
EXTD=which is the most devastating thing on the set, "When I Drink My 
EXTD=Wine." Charlie Alridge's "Mama" restates the alleged reason for S
EXTD=kid Row Joe's existence -- or lack of -- with "Mama" and the unli
EXTD=kely choice of Tom Paxton's "Bottle of Wine," later covered by th
EXTD=e rock band the Fireballs, and Johnny Mullin' "I Judged a Man" is
EXTD=the album's best morality play. In all Wagoner succeeds again on
EXTD=another of his concept albums. He lends both humor and pathos to
EXTD=his subject and delivers all of it without a trace of irony or c
EXTD=ynicism. This is honky tonk music all right, but it may make you 
EXTD=think twice about hanging out in them so often.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n
