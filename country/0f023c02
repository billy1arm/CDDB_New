EXTD=\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  If the final installment of ABKCO's ser
EXTD=ies of box sets containing CD replicas of the Rolling Stones' ori
EXTD=ginal singles for Decca and London during the '60s seems not quit
EXTD=e as impressive as the first two, there's a reason for it: it's n
EXTD=ot. But that has little to do with either the music -- some of th
EXTD=e Stones' very best is here, including "Street Fighting Man," "Ho
EXTD=nky Tonk Women," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash," all viable contenders 
EXTD=for the greatest rock and roll single ever -- or the packaging, whi
EXTD=ch is every bit as lavish and loving as the first two installment
EXTD=s. Instead, the problem is that the nine singles collected here a
EXTD=re a bit of a hodgepodge. The aforementioned trio are the group's
EXTD=last singles of the '60s, with the latter two being the last two
EXTD=singles the band conceived as stand-alone 45s. After that, there
EXTD=were two singles pulled from the 1971 album Sticky Fingers -- "B
EXTD=rown Sugar" and "Wild Horses," both backed by album tracks (the f
EXTD=ormer had a live version of Chuck Berry's "Let It Rock" on a U.K.
EXTD=pressing, but that's not available here) -- and that LP is more 
EXTD=commonly associated with the Stones' '70s albums for their own la
EXTD=bel, not their '60s work, so even if historically they were part 
EXTD=of the London years, they don't quite feel like the end of this c
EXTD=hapter - rather, they feel like the beginning of the next. That ac
EXTD=counts for half of Singles 1968-1971. The remaining five discs co
EXTD=ntain Mick Jagger's excellent solo single of "Memo from Turner" f
EXTD=rom the film Performance, two singles from the 1975 '60s rarities
EXTD=compilation Metamorphosis ("I Don't Know Why"/"Jiving Sister Fan
EXTD=ny" and "I Don't Know Why"/"Try a Little Harder"), the "Sympathy 
EXTD=for the Devil" single -- which was released in the U.K. in 1976, 
EXTD=but is presented in its 2003 form containing contemporary dance r
EXTD=emixes by the Neptunes and Fatboy Slim, variations that are, need
EXTD=less to say, rather incongruous in this setting -- and, finally, 
EXTD=a welcome bonus DVD containing the Stones playing "Time Is On My 
EXTD=Side" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, a live version of "Have Yo
EXTD=u Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?" from 1967, and
EXTD=the classic promo video for "Jumpin' Jack Flash" from 1968, as w
EXTD=ell as an out-of-place 2003 video for the Neptunes' remix of "Sym
EXTD=pathy for the Devil." While all these odds and ends are nice to h
EXTD=ave, since they tie up any loose ends from this era, the end resu
EXTD=lt doesn't have the narrative flow or the rarities of the previou
EXTD=s installments. That said, Singles 1968-1971 is a wonderful set f
EXTD=or collectors, and it retains the high standard of the rest of th
EXTD=e series.   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nHalf.com Details \nPr

EXTD=ets, SINGLES 1968-1971 is yet another must-have for hardcore Roll

EXTD=presents the original 45's in CD format, along with a booklet of
EXTD=informative liner notes, vintage photos, and promotional artwork
EXTD=\n\nAlthough the "Jumpin' Jack Flash" B-side, "Child of the Moon

EXTD=s (the song clearly echoes Lennon/McCartney's "Rain"), the aforem

EXTD=as the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band with blazing abandon. Gi
EXTD=ven Brian Jones's 1969 death and his subsequent replacement by a 
EXTD=young Mick Taylor, the era was clearly a transitional period for 
EXTD=the Stones, and the music reflects this, most notably in the coun
EXTD=try twang of "Honky Tonk Women" and the wistful "Wild Horses." A 
EXTD=particular treat for Jagger fans is the inclusion of his struttin
EXTD=g "Memo from Turner" single, taken from the film PERFORMANCE, alo

EXTD=includes a "Sympathy for the Devil" single updated with 2003 remi

EXTD=n Years" Compared To The 3 "Singles" Box Sets, June 12, 2006 \nBy
EXTD=Mark Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nThe purpose of this review 
EXTD=is to completely compare the contents of "Singles Collection: The
EXTD=London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets which as a group conta
EXTD=in the same songs plus more. There are some good comparisons in t
EXTD=he other reviews, but also several omissions and inaccuracies, so
EXTD=hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear things up a bit as t
EXTD=o what songs are included on each, and which "missing" songs can 
EXTD=also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, particularly "More Hot Roc
EXTD=ks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these collections is rathe
EXTD=r expensive, so hopefully this may help you decide which sets you
EXTD=really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thing first though, the s
EXTD=ongs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP contained in the "Single
EXTD=s 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the full length CD "Got 
EXTD=Live If You Want It". They share the same title but that's all, a
EXTD=nd were actually two different releases. Buying the full length C
EXTD=D will NOT get you all the same songs on the EP as indicated in a
EXTD=nother review. With that out of the way..... \n\n"Singles 1963-19
EXTD=65": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the s
EXTD=ongs included in this box set, with the exception of 3 original B
EXTD=ritish EP's exclusive to the box set. The first EP contains You B
EXTD=etter Move On (also available on "December's Children") and Poiso
EXTD=n Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 also available on "More Hot 
EXTD=Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The second EP (originally titl
EXTD=ed "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 South Mich
EXTD=igan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around and Around, all of whi
EXTD=ch are also available on the "12 X 5" CD. The third EP (the afore
EXTD=mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contains early live version
EXTD=s of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, Pain I
EXTD=n My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alright, none of which a
EXTD=re available on any other CD (with the possible exception of I'm 
EXTD=Alright which may or may not be the same version included on the 
EXTD=full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Y
EXTD=ears" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early single/B-sides Come O
EXTD=n (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as well as I Want To Be Lo
EXTD=ved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren't available on any o
EXTD=ther ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs not included elsewher
EXTD=e, plus the box set includes the live EP. So the deciding factor 
EXTD=between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" would appear to be
EXTD=the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "Singles Collection: The L
EXTD=ondon Years" contains all of the songs included in this 2nd box s
EXTD=et, with no exceptions. Both contain the single/B-sides Long Long
EXTD=While and We Love You (also available on "More Hot Rocks") and Sad
EXTD=Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which aren't available on any ot
EXTD=her ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs not included elsewhere
EXTD=No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1968-1971": "Singles Colle
EXTD=ction: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in th
EXTD=is 3rd box set, with a few unique exceptions. The third box set a
EXTD=dditionally contains Everybody Needs Somebody to Love (also avail
EXTD=able on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and three non-ABKCO B-sides and 
EXTD=3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-sides are the Ry Cooder
EXTD=instrumental Natural Magic (from the film "Performance" soundtra
EXTD=ck...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bitch and Sway which were
EXTD=the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. My guess is the licens
EXTD=ing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin Records, etc. and ha
EXTD=dn't yet been negotiated when "The London Years" was originally r
EXTD=eleased back in 1989. The remixes appear to be 3 different "rap" 
EXTD=style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The box set also contain
EXTD=s a bonus DVD (see the item description for more on that). \n\nCo
EXTD=nclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" contain the
EXTD=B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on "More Hot Rocks") an
EXTD=d Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available on "Hot Rocks 1"). So
EXTD=the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 68-7
EXTD=1" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-sides, the three remi
EXTD=xes and the DVD contained in the box set. \n\nFinal Conclusion: F
EXTD=or the completest collector who has to have absolutely everything
EXTD=on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Buy all 3 box sets, or buy 
EXTD="Singles Collection: The London Years" and the two box sets "Sing
EXTD=les 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of duplication, though "The L
EXTD=ondon Years" runs a little cheaper than the box sets and you don't 
EXTD=have to change CD's as often). \n\nA slightly cheaper option if y
EXTD=ou're mainly interested in completing the ABKCO Rolling Stones "c
EXTD=anon" not released on the regular studio full-length CD's is to b
EXTD=uy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and "Singles 1963-1965"
EXTD=You'd only be missing the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 Sym
EXTD=pathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper option still, if you'r
EXTD=e only interested in the very early singles and live EP and can liv
EXTD=e without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to buy "More Hot Rocks: B
EXTD=ig Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1965". With those 2 yo
EXTD=u'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Your Plane? and the th
EXTD=ree non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\nIn truth, the 2nd and 
EXTD=3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London Years" make an inter
EXTD=esting listen because each is primarily made up of A and B sides no
EXTD=t included on the regular studio CD's. So they're almost like lis
EXTD=tening to independent CD's without repeating too many songs you'l
EXTD=l hear when listening to the other albums. The 2nd disc from "Mor
EXTD=e Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)"
EXTD=do the same, only with different selections of songs, so compari
EXTD=ng these two further is highly recommended as well. \n\nDecisions
EXTD=, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA
EXTD=real gem for collectors, March 3, 2005 \nBy  Greg Pearce\n\nThis
EXTD=is the third and final installment of box sets covering the Ston
EXTD=es singles released between 1963 - 1971. All three box sets are a
EXTD=treasure for stones collectors because we get the original artwo
EXTD=rk for all the singles (and early EP's) that the Stones released 
EXTD=in the sixties. The cd's actually look like old 45's. This box se
EXTD=t covering the years 1968 - 1971 has a cool bonus dvd with severa
EXTD=l live performances and the classic old Jumpin' Jack Flash video.
EXTD=However, this series of box sets is not for casual fans. The vas
EXTD=t majority of songs can be found on the old London Years box set 
EXTD=which Abkco remastered in their 2002 Rolling Stones remastered se
EXTD=ries. One omission on the singles 1968 - 1971 box set is the live
EXTD=version of Let It Rock recorded at Leeds University in 1971 and 
EXTD=originally released in the UK as the B side to Brown Sugar is not
EXTD=included. Apparently this is because Virgin owns the rights to t
EXTD=hat song. Bottom line is that all three singles box sets are awes
EXTD=ome if you want to have cd replicants of all the original 45's an
EXTD=d the early EP's with their original artwork. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CU

EXTD=acular detail and craftsmanship however, make this -- as with the
EXTD=other sets -- a worthy collector's item - down to the 'grooves' o
EXTD=n the the top-side of the CD singles. The only disc on which the 
EXTD=grooves do not belong is the 2003 SFTD CD single. Without a doubt
EXTD=, the inclusion of the rare *Street Fighting Man* PS is a joy to 
EXTD=own for most whom could not afford over $10,000 for the real thin
