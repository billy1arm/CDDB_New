EXTD=the remarkable thing about this box is that it paints a bigger pi

EXTD=Land of Many Churches, a wildly ambitious gospel double LP with e

EXTD=enture, captured best on that Bob Wills tribute, which he recorde
EXTD=d not long after learning how to play fiddle himself. This blend 
EXTD=of bravado, respect, and restlessness gives his music an almost l
EXTD=imitless depth, a fact that's showcased in a set of this magnitud

EXTD=, the HAG box set, lovingly compiled by hardcore country completi
EXTD=st label Bear Family, covers some of the most crucial years of Me
EXTD=rle Haggard's career. From 1968 to 1976, Haggard did for country 
EXTD=music what Frank Sinatra had done for pop vocals by popularizing 
EXTD=the concept-album phenomenon. This set includes Haggard's first-c
EXTD=lass tribute albums to Bob Wills and Jimmie Rodgers, his gospel a
EXTD=lbum recorded in rural Baptist churches, his New Orleans-recorded
EXTD=Dixieland album, and more. Also part of the package are three li
EXTD=ve albums (including the milestone OKIE FROM MUSKOGEE-LIVE) and a
EXTD=batch of solo instrumental recordings by Haggard's longtime band
EXTD=the Strangers. An immersive experience in the vintage Haggard ca
EXTD=talog, HAG contains both classic staples of the country giant's c

EXTD=6-CD box (LP-size) with 120-page hardcover book, 168 tracks. Play
EXTD=ing time approx. 440 mns.\nMerle Haggard was one of the first cou
EXTD=ntry artists to see the LP as more than one hit and some filler s
EXTD=ongs.\nNow Bear Family gathers together all of his 'concept' LPs 
EXTD=for Capitol 1968 -1976, plus the 'live' LPs...  plus the LPs by M
EXTD=erle Haggard's band, the Strangers!\nFans and critics alike view 
EXTD=this as Merle Haggard's finest work.\n\n\nMerle Haggard was a gro
EXTD=undbreaking artist in many ways. After his initial success, he de
EXTD=voted a lot of time and creative energy to 'concepts' that intere
EXTD=sted him, including live albums, tribute albums, gospel albums, a
EXTD=nd The Strangers' instrumental albums. The third and final box se
EXTD=t in Bear Family's documentation of Merle Haggard's Capitol recor
EXTD=dings includes all of these 'concepts.'\n\nThis is some of the fi
EXTD=nest music from Merle Haggard's 45 year career. Fans and critics 
EXTD=agree on that. The box includes the Jimmie Rodgers tribute double
EXTD=album from 1968 and the Bob Wills tribute album from 1970 for wh
EXTD=ich Merle Haggard reunited many of Bob Wills's original Texas Pla
EXTD=yboys. There are three exciting live albums, including one of the
EXTD=best selling country albums of all time, 'Okie From Muskogee--Li
EXTD=ve In Muskogee, Oklahoma.' There is the ambitious 'Land Of Many C
EXTD=hurches' gospel project, for which Merle Haggard recorded revival
EXTD=style gospel music in backwoods Baptist churches, San Quentin, a
EXTD=Nashville rescue mission and a California Pentecostal church. Th
EXTD=e set also includes the complete Strangers instrumental output...
EXTD=all of the songs from their five 'solo' albums plus many unrelea
EXTD=sed surprises, featuring knockout playing from Roy Nichols on gui
EXTD=tar and Norm Hamlet on steel guitar.\n\nThis box set captures an 
EXTD=artist using his success to take his art in new directions. This 
EXTD=is the real Merle Haggard: traditionalist, iconoclast, but above 
EXTD=all musician.
