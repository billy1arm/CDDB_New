EXTD=IEW (This Compilation) In early 2006, roughly in time for the 40t
EXTD=h anniversary of Merle Haggard's debut album, Capitol Nashville l
EXTD=aunched an ambitious Haggard catalog project, reissuing ten album
EXTD=s as a series of five two-fers, each adorned with bonus tracks. A
EXTD=ll these albums had been reissued before, either stateside by Cap
EXTD=itol or Koch or in the U.K. by EMI or BGO, but they've never have
EXTD=been given such an excellent treatment as they are here. The alb
EXTD=ums are paired together in logical, chronological order, the 24-b
EXTD=it digital remastering gives these recordings the best sound they
EXTD='ve ever had, the front cover artwork is reproduced for each albu
EXTD=m on a two-fer, and the liner notes are candid and detailed. Dedi
EXTD=cated Hag fans certainly have nearly all this material in their c
EXTD=ollection -- not only have the albums been on CD, but the bonus t
EXTD=racks have by and large appeared on Bear Family's box Untamed Haw
EXTD=k, which chronicled his early work for Capitol, or showed up on C
EXTD=apitol's own box, Down Every Road -- but they still may be tempte
EXTD=d by this series, since these discs not only sound and look terri
EXTD=fic, but they're also more listenable than any previous CD incarn
EXTD=ation of these classic albums.\n\nAnd make no mistake, all ten al
EXTD=bums featured in Capitol Nashville's first wave of Haggard reissu
EXTD=es in February 2006 are classic albums - some may be a little stro
EXTD=nger than others, but there's not a weak one in the bunch, and th
EXTD=ey all stand as some of the finest music of their time. The third
EXTD=of these two-fers pairs the first two of Merle's three 1968 albu
EXTD=ms, Sing Me Back Home and The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde. With thes
EXTD=e two records, Haggard's music began to deepen, as his writing gr
EXTD=ew more evocative and his musical range expanded. Of the two, Sin
EXTD=g Me Back Home shared the most in common with its two predecessor
EXTD=s, yet the arrangements were richer and subtly more ambitious -- 
EXTD=witness the 12-string guitars that color his version of Dallas Fr
EXTD=azier's "The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp." Haggard draws inspir
EXTD=ation from one of his core influences, Lefty Frizzell, on a grace
EXTD=ful cover of "Mom and Dad's Waltz," while he collaborates with To
EXTD=mmy Collins on the barroom anthem "Wine Takes Me Away" and Wynn S
EXTD=tewart on "My Past Is Present." Haggard's originals on Sing Me Ba
EXTD=ck Home are assured and fully realized, whether it's on the rocki
EXTD=ng, funny "Seeing Eye Dog," the lazily bluesy "Good Times," or th
EXTD=e deliberate answer to "The Bottle Let Me Down," "I'll Leave the 
EXTD=Bottle on the Bar." It adds up to a record that isn't just a typi
EXTD=cally excellent Haggard album, but one that points the way to the
EXTD=progress of The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nAlthough the title 
EXTD=of The Legend may imply that this record is a concept album, Hagg
EXTD=ard's celebration of the legendary outlaws -- inspired by Arthur 
EXTD=Penn's 1967 film starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the t
EXTD=itle roles -- doesn't extend past the opening title track, nor do
EXTD=es the ramped-up, neo-bluegrass of that song (featuring banjo by 
EXTD=no less than Glen Campbell) echo throughout the record. Instead, 
EXTD=it settles into a nice, mellow groove, building on the Bakersfiel
EXTD=d ballad style by adding slightly stronger folk influences and ma
EXTD=intaining a reflective mood. Haggard relies on material from seve
EXTD=ral different writers here, recording three songs by Dallas Frazi
EXTD=er -- "Love Has a Mind of Its Own," "The Train Never Stops (At Ou
EXTD=r Town)," "Will You Visit Me on Sundays?" -- the Leon Payne tune 
EXTD="You Still Have a Place in My Heart," plus "Money Tree," another 
EXTD=Lefty Frizzell cover. None of these are conventional choices, and
EXTD=they're given fine interpretations by Haggard, who also contribu
EXTD=tes two solid songs in "My Ramona" and "Because You Can't Be Mine
EXTD=" However, they're all overshadowed by "Today I Started Loving Y
EXTD=ou Again," the timeless ballad Haggard co-wrote with Bonnie Owens
EXTD=that stands as one of his greatest moments. Its presence along w
EXTD=ith the terrific title track and Haggard and the Strangers' restles
EXTD=s but quiet musical exploration make The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde
EXTD=yet another first-rate album from Hag, who was on a hell of a ho
EXTD=t streak late in the '60s, as this two-fer amply illustrates.  --
EXTD=Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (Sing Me Back Home
EXTD=) Sing Me Back Home follows the blueprint of Merle Haggard's firs
EXTD=t three albums, balancing a hit single with album tracks and a co
EXTD=uple of covers, but there is a difference. Where the previous alb
EXTD=um Branded Man was a transitional album, hinting that Haggard's t
EXTD=alents were deepening substantially, Sing Me Back Home is the res
EXTD=ult of the flowering of his talent. Like any '60s country album, 
EXTD=there are a couple of throwaways (like "The Bottle Let Me Down" r
EXTD=ewrite "I'll Leave the Bottle On the Bar"), but the majority of t
EXTD=he album is full of rich material, from "The Son of Hickory Holle
EXTD=r's Tramp," "Good Times," and "Wine Take Me Away." -- Stephen Tho

EXTD=The title track to this 1968 LP, Hag's sixth, remains one of the 
EXTD=most poignant and profound singles in country music history, a so
EXTD=ng of a doomed prisoner who wishes to escape his fate and return 
EXTD=to the family fold through the capacity of music. The other 11 cu
EXTD=ts that fill out the record may not quite reach those heights, bu
EXTD=t there isn't a slouch among them. Hag's versatility is on displa
EXTD=y: regretful "bottle" shuffles, bad-love weepers, and down-home b
EXTD=lues accompany a heart-rending cover of Lefty Frizzell's "Mom and
EXTD=Dad's Waltz," which approaches the emotional power of Frizzell's
EXTD=original. The Strangers are, as usual, flawless, and Haggard's f
EXTD=aith in all of the material (his own as well as others') gives hi

EXTD=many different record companies, but for many years his actual a
EXTD=lbums, as they were originally released, have been unavailable. K
EXTD=och Records has begun to rectify this situation by rereleasing a 
EXTD=number of Haggard's early Capitol albums, among them 1968's SING 
EXTD=ME BACK HOME.\n\nUntil the late '80s, the country music industry 
EXTD=was entirely oriented toward singles, and many artists exerted mi
EXTD=nimal effort to release quality albums. Haggard has always been t
EXTD=he exception to that rule. Perhaps because he is a gifted and pro
EXTD=lific songwriter, Haggard has always been able to flesh out his a
EXTD=lbums with top-quality material. Among the non-single tracks on S
EXTD=ING ME BACK HOME are such great originals as "Wine Take Me Away,"
EXTD="I'll Leave The Bottle On The Bar," and "Look Over Me." Haggard 
EXTD=has never denied his debt to earlier country greats, and here he 
EXTD=tips his hat to one of his favorites, Lefty Frizzell, with a fine
EXTD=cover version of "Mom And Dad Waltz." Thanks to Koch, fans unabl
EXTD=e to afford Bear Family's expensive UNTAMED HAWK box set can now 
EXTD=enjoy all of Merle Haggard's great early recordings.\n\n
