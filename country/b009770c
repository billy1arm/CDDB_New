EXTD=suite of four mid-'70s albums and a surprising number of hits: he
EXTD=r sound was clearly traditional, but also tastefully up-to-date w
EXTD=ith folk-rock and singer/songwriter styles, and her cyrstalline, 
EXTD=febrile vocals took standards such as "Sweet Dreams" and "If I Co

EXTD=ese early hits, and if it's too brief to capture all the best son
EXTD=gs from four-star albums such as Elite Hotel, Luxury Liner, and Q
EXTD=uarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town, it shows why Harris is important 
EXTD=and why she continues to make adventurous country music. Through 
EXTD=unfailingly tasteful song selection, brilliant occasional songwri

EXTD=) \nAlthough Profile is a wonderful listening experience, it does
EXTD=n't quite do justice to the early work of this amazing songbird. 
EXTD=It draws heavily on the Pieces Of The Sky album with these great 
EXTD=songs If I Could Only Win Your Love, Too Far Gone and Boulder To 
EXTD=Birmingham, her moving elegy to Gram Parsons. \n\nOther very beau
EXTD=tiful songs include the gentle love ballad Sweet Dreams, the sad 
EXTD=story song To Daddy, Making Believe, a yearning song of lost love
EXTD=, and the stirring Together Again. With her crystalline vocals, h
EXTD=er expert phrasing and her tasteful choice of material, Emmylou h
EXTD=as created a magnificent body of work. \n\nNow for the omissions!
EXTD=When I Stop Dreaming from Luxury Liner is Emmylou at her best. T
EXTD=ill I Gain Control Again and Satan's Jewel Crown from Elite Hotel
EXTD=are must haves. And the sublime My Songbird from Quarter Moon In
EXTD=A Ten Cent Town is one of the most spiritual songs she ever reco
EXTD=rded. \n\nIn the light of this, I award this album only four star
EXTD=s, but Profile is still a great sample of her work from that time
EXTD=I recommend that you get all of the aforementioned albums so as
EXTD=not to miss out on any of her gems. \n\nAmazon.com Customer Revi

EXTD=d]\nThis compilation includes three tracks from each of her first
EXTD=four albums, when her style was country-rock - very different fr

EXTD=\nDuring these years (1975 to 1978), Emmylou had many hits on th

EXTD=ll cover versions and all included here. They were Together again
EXTD=(Buck Owens), Sweet dreams (Patsy Cline) and Two more bottles of
EXTD=wine (Delbert McClinton). Emmylou had many other big country hit

EXTD=on a compilation CD many years later. Thus, Emmylou's version, i

EXTD=ow what all the fuss was about when Emmylou Harris burst on the c
EXTD=ountry scene three decades ago, it's all here in this compilation
EXTD=, which brings together twelve of her greatest early tracks. Her 
EXTD=distinctive voice, part reed, part silver, full of emotion, and h
EXTD=er interpretive range--she could convince in the most soulful bal
EXTD=lad as well as the most rollicking of rockabilly--are in plentifu

EXTD=is CD is also illustrative as a retrospective of the best of coun
EXTD=try that stretches all the way back to its origins with the Carte
EXTD=r Family's "Hello Stranger." Other highlights are the strongly fe
EXTD=minist "One of These Days," and sweet covers of Patsy Cline's "Sw

EXTD=ed States]\nYou know, I did fall in love with Emmy Lou around 27 
EXTD=years ago when I spun records for a living at a small radio stati
EXTD=on in Cottonwood, Arizona. How could I help falling for her when 
EXTD=listening to her "Sweet Dreams", "Making Believe, and "Easy From 
EXTD=Now On." These are all romantic classics in her unmistakable styl
EXTD=e. Listening to her rendition of Buck Owens' "Together Again"...w
EXTD=ell, you know between her and Buck which one I'd choose to be tog
EXTD=ether with. LOL All her early favorites are here such as Dolly Pa
EXTD=rton's "To Daddy", "If I Could Only Win Your Love," "Too Far Gone
EXTD=", and "Boulder to Birmingham. All here and jusst as fresh as whe

EXTD=C'est' La Vie", "Making Believe", and "Hello Stranger". Fellow by

EXTD=y Lou's earliest hits. She was among the top country gals of the

EXTD=were among the best of country, a style of music you don't hear

EXTD=viewer: Matt Coker (Pacifica, CA, USA) \nEmmylou Harris has becom
EXTD=e one of the most vital and talented artists in music history. PR
EXTD=OFILE: THE BEST OF EMMYLOU HARRIS is a remarkable collection of t
EXTD=he recordings that launched her into acclaim. Harris has impeccab
EXTD=le taste in chosing her material as these twelve songs prove. Her
EXTD=gorgeous voice makes these songs unforgettable moments. With thr
EXTD=ee tracks from each of her first four albums (made after her work
EXTD=with Gram Parsons) - PROFILE offers a terrific sampler of Harris'
EXTD=early work. "If I Could Only Win Your Love" (a #4 hit), "Too Far
EXTD=Gone" (her first single), and the inspirational "Boulder To Birm
EXTD=ingham" (Harris' self-penned tribute to Parsons) come from her ex
EXTD=traordinary debut PIECES OF THE SKY. From her outstanding ELITE H
EXTD=OTEL come some of this album's most successful songs: "Together A
EXTD=gain" and "Sweet Dreams" were both #1 hits, and "One Of These Day
EXTD=s" peaked at #3. LUXURY LINER is Harris' best selling album to da
EXTD=te, an essential classic of American music. "C'est La Vie" was a 
EXTD=#6 hit and "Making Believe" was a #8 - also "Hello Stranger" a mar
EXTD=velous cover comes from that great album. Harris' third #1 hit wa
EXTD=s "Two More Bottles Of Wine", "To Daddy" was a #3 hit, and the am
EXTD=azing "Easy From Now On" peaked at #12 from 1978's QUARTER MOON I
EXTD=N A TEN CENT TOWN. Some of Harris' best uptempo numbers, "Two Mor
EXTD=e Bottles Of Wine", and Chuck Berry's "C'est La Vie" as well as s
EXTD=ome of her most elegent slow songs "Sweet Dreams", "Boulder To Bi
EXTD=rmingham", and "Making Believe", are found here. This collection 
EXTD=is remarkable because it is a complete set for the period it cove
EXTD=rs. All of her solo singles from 1975-1978 are here. It was a con
EXTD=cise quality that wasn't repeated when her next hits collection P
EXTD=ROFILE II was issued. That collection missed several of her big s
EXTD=ingles from 1979-1984. (One could have been issued MUCH earlier).
EXTD=While many of her albums are essential listening - and her artist
EXTD=ry is at a high point on those original recordings. PROFILE remai
EXTD=ns an exceptional introduction to one of the greatest talents in 
EXTD=music history. For those familiar with these songs, its still an 
EXTD=incredible listen. The music on this collection is infinitely sup
EXTD=erior to the formatted releases coming out of Nashville today.\n\n
EXTD=Amazon.com Customer Review\nThis CD is choice!, October 10, 1998\n
EXTD=Reviewer: A music fan\nThis album was my first introduction to Em
EXTD=mylou Harris and I played it on 33 1/3 rpm vinyl til there was no
EXTD=thing left but scratches. I replaced it with the CD (It was one o
EXTD=f the first 5 CDs I ever purchased) and I am now in a state of mo
EXTD=urning because time and carelessness have rendered it nonfunction
EXTD=al. So I am thrilled to be able to replace it through Amazon. Thi
EXTD=s is music for the heart, whether you are in love, in pain, lonel
EXTD=y as hell, or disgusted with the universe. Like an old friend, I 
EXTD=may go for months without listening to it, but when I need to hea
EXTD=r it I need to hear it. This is a collection of music I never wan
EXTD=t to be separate from.\n\nHalf.com Album Credits\nJonathan Edward

EXTD=make PROFILE a real gem.\n\nHarris' stunningly beautiful voice gl
EXTD=ides effortlessly over the many country ballads. Not surprisingly
