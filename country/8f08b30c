EXTD=recorded back in his Mitchell Trio days. It displays one of JD's predominate talents...the gift of melody. Its a beautiful song, pure and simple. "Darcy Farrow" has become a classic folk tune and although it did not originate from JD it was another 
EXTD=song that has become closely associated with him. It is another example of poignant and heartfelt finger-style guitar playing and singing that JD was a master craftsman at. It is another personal favorite song of mine to sing and play on the guitar.

EXTD=this is an important album that shows a really accurate picture of who Denver really was - it's an important musical artifact in a way. I don't think it's Denver's best, necessarily, but it's close. He's in the middle of a transformation here--Denver
EXTD=had about 5 stages: the first as sort of a nerdy folk singer, the second as a hippie, the third as a marketing phenomenon, the fourth as a has-been, and the fifth as a come-back. Most people know the marketing phenomenon. RMH falls right in the midd
EXTD=le of his hippie period, and for me, that's when he's at his most likable and artistic. On the original album inside cover, he's wearing a t-shirt that says "Be kind to animals--kiss a BEAVER"--something so utterly masculine you'd never see it again 
EXTD=after he became a phenomenon. That's iconic of what I love about this album, and the follow up "Farewell Andromeda," which is probably his best work--he doesn't give a hell about pleasing anyone, and he's finally found his art. Plus he had a guy name

EXTD=album as a whole doesn't wear so well sound-quality-wise--it would probably pay to find a release that's been remastered. "Early Winter/Late Spring" is still one of his best songs. And this has to be one of the best album covers of all time. It was

EXTD=he fessed up about "Take Me Home, Country Roads,"--that it was "really" Billy and Taffy Danoff's work. It was common during that time for artists to insist on a songwriting credit from "unproven" songwriters as a way of cashing in later on ASCAP/BMI
EXTD=money. I always wondered how much of RMH and Eagle and the Hawk Denver actually wrote because, structurally, they are so much more complex musically than his later work--if these were actually more the product of Taylor than Denver. Not that I want 
EXTD=to take Denver's name in vain because I don't. But it seems that charisma goes a long way in popular music. Sometimes fantastically talented guys like Taylor get lost in the shuffle, or they produce little-known albums that no one ever hears. I agree
EXTD=with you about the over production. I truly love some of Denver's later work as well--Back Home Again and Windsong. But when I pull out one of his CDs, it's usually RMH, Aerie, or Farewell Andromeda. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nWho ever said 7
