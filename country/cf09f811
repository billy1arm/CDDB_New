EXTD=Buck Owens And His Buckaroos In Japan!\n1997 Sundazed Music Inc.\n
EXTD=\nOriginally Released 1967\nCD Edition Released November 11, 1997
EXTD=\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Long one of the finer efforts in the Buck
EXTD=Owens album catalog and also one of the finest live country reco
EXTD=rds of all time, In Japan! shines. Released by Capitol in 1967, i
EXTD=t finds Buck Owens and His Buckaroos in the prime of their chart-to
EXTD=pping existence and playing like a well-oiled machine, firing exq
EXTD=uisitely on all cylinders. The opening and closing remarks and be
EXTD=tween-song translating banter to the audience from MC Tetsuo Otsu
EXTD=ka make for wonderful ambience throughout, and Owens' good-nature
EXTD=d master-of-ceremonies turns work hand in glove with him. Musical
EXTD=ly, the Buckaroos, led by Don Rich, are at the top of their game,
EXTD=and the live versions here of "Open Up Your Heart," "Roll Out th
EXTD=e Red Carpet," and "Where Does the Good Times Go" sometimes eclip
EXTD=se their better-known hit studio versions. Although his Live at C
EXTD=arnegie Hall album is considered by most fans as definitive, here
EXTD='s another one that shouldn't be dismissed for a second.  -- Cub 
EXTD=Koda\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nUntil the classic Live at 
EXTD=Carnegie Hall resurfaces, this 1967 record will have to satisfy c
EXTD=ollectors who want to hear Buck Owens in a live setting. While th
EXTD=e material on Carnegie Hall may be better known than these songs,
EXTD=the performances on this Tokyo date are equally as strong--after
EXTD=all, it was recorded less than a year after the Carnegie Hall co
EXTD=ncert. In typical Buckaroo fashion, the playing is edgy and dead-
EXTD=on, except for an uncharacteristically slow start from lead guita
EXTD=rist Don Rich ("Take your gloves off, Don," Owens playfully chide
EXTD=s him). Owens sings in his uniquely evocative manner (backed by R
EXTD=ich's perfect harmonies) and doesn't allow the language barrier t
EXTD=o stand in the way of playful between-song chatter ("In America, 
EXTD=we have a state called Louisiana," he explains). He even offers s
EXTD=ome impressive lead guitar on "Tokyo Polka," written to commemora
EXTD=te the occasion, much to the delight of the boisterous crowd. --M

EXTD=COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nBuckaroos live sound at its peak, April 25, 
EXTD=2003 \nBy  redtunictroll (Earth, USA]\nThis 1967 live recording i
EXTD=s the perfect complement to the band's better-known Carnegie Hall
EXTD=release of 1966. Not only is the band in top musical form, their
EXTD=presentation to a Japanese audience leans more towards songs tha
EXTD=n shtick. Not that the shtick is missing entirely (it was - and i
EXTD=s to this day - an essential ingredient of the band's stage show)
EXTD=, but the skits presented at the Carnegie Hall disc are replaced 
EXTD=here with straight-ahead tunes.\nWhat's especially remarkable abo
EXTD=ut this concert is a song selection that introduces many new song
EXTD=s, including a few that appear nowhere else (or, at best, very ob
EXTD=scurely) in the Buckaroos record catalog. Among the new tunes are
EXTD="Adios, Farewell, Goodbye, Good Luck, So Long," "Open Up Your He
EXTD=art," and a trio of instrumentals: "Fiddle Polka," "Steel Guitar 
EXTD=Polka," and "Tokyo Polka." The Buckaroos also take on Cajun music
EXTD=with Bob Morris' "Fishin' on the Mississippi," with Owens' partn
EXTD=er, Don Rich, taking the lead vocal.\n\nAs on the Carnegie disc, 
EXTD=Owens and Rich sing harmonies with a magnetism that is supernatur
EXTD=al. As polished as their duets are on disc, sung live makes darin
EXTD=g is all the more evident. Accompanied by ringing telecasters (bo
EXTD=th Owens and Rich show off their ability to play stinging leads),
EXTD=Tom Brumley's twanging steel, and the solid bottom end of Wayne 
EXTD=Wilson and Willie Cantu, these tracks are at once letter-perfect,
EXTD=yet swinging and free. The Buckaroos had a musical chemistry tha
EXTD=t few bands could ever match, and "In Japan!" captures the band's
EXTD=essence in all its glory. \n\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nThis may b
EXTD=e the first live country album recorded outside the USA, and it c
EXTD=onveys the excitement of the crackling Bakersfield honky-tonk sty
EXTD=le of Buck Owens and His Buckaroos. Owens plays a few hits ("Second
EXTD=Fiddle," "Where Does the Good Times Go"), but a lot of new ones,
EXTD=including one written especially for the tour, the rollicking, s
EXTD=uper-speed instrumental "Tokyo Polka." The band--playing so sharp
EXTD=you could get cut if you got too close-- seems energized by the 
EXTD=extremely appreciative crowd, making this a rousing, dynamic set.
EXTD=Owens fans will want--need--to have this, but for younger listen
EXTD=ers who think honky-tonk start with Dwight Yoakum, this is defini
EXTD=tely worth a shot.
