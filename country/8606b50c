EXTD=n of various performances George Jones recorded at United Artists
EXTD=, including album tracks, singles, and new performances, Sings th
EXTD=e Hits of His Country Cousins is an entertaining hodgepodge of Jo
EXTD=nes' versions of classic country songs. There's a wide variety of
EXTD=styles on the album, from the Western swing of Bob Wills' "Silve
EXTD=r Dew on the Bluegrass Tonight" and the honky tonk of Hank Willia
EXTD=ms' "I Could Never Be Ashamed of You" and Webb Pierce's "The Same
EXTD=Sweet Girl" to the pop leanings of Hank Cochran's "A Little Bitt
EXTD=y Tear," the traditional country of Roy Acuff's "The Precious Jew
EXTD=el," and the country gospel of "Peace in the Valley" and "Wings o
EXTD=f a Dove." Despite the fact that the album features songs recorde
EXTD=d at different sessions and music that is stylistically opposed, 
EXTD=every cut is first-rate, which makes Sings the Hits of His Countr

EXTD=George Jones, a period during which he perfected his distinctive 
EXTD=and inimitable brand of honky-tonk music. It was also an extremel

EXTD=Billboard's country Top Forty and released five excellent albums
EXTD=, among them GEORGE JONES SINGS THE HITS OF HIS COUNTRY COUSINS.\n

EXTD=der Jones the best country singer of all-time. There isn't a weak
EXTD=track among the twelve here - the only disappointment is that the
EXTD=record ends much too soon. Razor and Tie has also released SHE T

EXTD=ecordings from this era, as well as a number of Jones' early 1960
