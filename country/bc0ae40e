EXTD=\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: America Live marked the beginning of the g
EXTD=roup's history as a duo. Recorded at the last of a series of four
EXTD=shows at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in July of 1977, with 
EXTD=film music legend Elmer Bernstein conducting the orchestra and Ge

EXTD=Their ninth album in seven years (counting a greatest-hits comp

EXTD=ease. Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell are both in excellent voice
EXTD=, and one could hardly ask for a sharper or more balanced live re
EXTD=cording. The expected mid-'70s hits such as "Tin Man," "Ventura H
EXTD=ighway," and "Sister Golden Hair" (all brilliantly sung, and wort

EXTD=t highly personal tracks like "Amber Cascades" are represented as
EXTD=well, along with early classics like "I Need You" and "A Horse W
EXTD=ith No Name" (the latter done with a beautifully elegant yet rest
EXTD=rained orchestral arrangement). One does wonder, however, if ther
EXTD=e were more to this show than the 14 songs represented on the ori
EXTD=ginal LP, which might make for a good CD expansion someday. On th
EXTD=e other hand, given that Warner Bros. has never seen fit to relea
EXTD=se this album on CD anywhere but in Europe and Japan, that might

EXTD=ember 30, 1998 \nReviewer: A music fan  \nNot bad, but I thought 
EXTD=it was over produced. Goerge Martin tried to make it sound like a
EXTD=studio album, using an orchestra to back the band. This causes A
EXTD=merica to lose some energy and makes them sound more like a night
EXTD=club act than a classic rock band. Though it does provide some i
EXTD=nsight into how George Martin would have handled America's early
