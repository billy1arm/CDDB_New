EXTD=ry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and co-producers Karl Richardson and Albhy
EXTD=Galuten remembered Rogers' pop roots with the First Edition and,
EXTD=despite the country twang of "Buried Treasure," the slick musici
EXTD=anship and modulation are not your typical country and western. The
EXTD=re are four tracks written by Barry and Maurice and five more by 
EXTD=Barry, Maurice, and brother Robin Gibb, including the stunning nu
EXTD=mber one hit from September 1983, "Islands in the Stream." It hit
EXTD=number one across the board on adult contemporary, country, and 
EXTD=the Top 40, and deservedly so -- the melody is infectious, impecc
EXTD=able, and perfectly recorded. Keep in mind this was five years af

EXTD=zing vocal sound to carry the melody. "Living With You" features 
EXTD=the Bee Gees -- it is Rogers fronting the Bee Gees, and why they 
EXTD=didn't seek out more artists, new as well as established, to work
EXTD=their magic on is a pity. It's a lush setting for the country su
EXTD=perstar, and as Barbara Streisand and Dionne Warwick enjoyed succ
EXTD=ess thanks to this creative team, Eyes That See in the Dark stand
EXTD=s as an important piece of the Rogers catalog and a really timele
EXTD=ss recording. The Gatlin Brothers add their magic to "Evening Sta
EXTD=r" and Buried Treasure," and these elements bring the Barry Gibb/
EXTD=Richardson/Galuten thousand-tracks production down to earth. "Eve
EXTD=ning Star" doesn't have the complexities of Samantha Sang's "Emot
EXTD=ion," the producers being very careful to keep it simple, somethi

EXTD=only ten tracks on Eyes That See in the Dark, Jimmie Haskell's st
EXTD=rings the major instrument next to Rogers' sympathetic vocal perf
EXTD=ormance. "Midsummer Nights" is co-authored by Barry Gibb and Galu
EXTD=ten, making Barry the catalyst and driving force, as he is the on
EXTD=ly person with a hand in every tune. "Midsummer Nights" brings th
EXTD=ings back up after "Hold Me," and it is more adult contemporary t
EXTD=han country. It would have made a great single but, as it was, th
EXTD=e opening track, "This Woman," went Top 25 in early 1984, and by 
EXTD=the end of that year Rogers would post his 27th Top 40 hit, endin

EXTD=hey didn't, but the pretty Barry and Maurice Gibb tune "I Will Al
EXTD=ways Love You" (not to be confused with Parton's hit of the same 
EXTD=name) and the title track certainly should have found some chart 
EXTD=action as well. Eyes That See in the Dark is not the definitive K

EXTD=with the classics, September 30, 2004\nReviewer: R. Spencer "Rob"
EXTD=(London, England]\nIn 1983, Kenny Rogers had already had a succe
EXTD=ssfull hit album with "We've got tonight", but straight after rec
EXTD=ording that he switched record labels to RCA and almost instantly
EXTD=put out this set, which quickly overshadowed the "We've got toni
EXTD=ght" album (on Liberty records) halfway through the promotion. \n
EXTD=I was only three years old when this album was released, yet I do
EXTD=remember having it bought for me by my parents as, even at that 
EXTD=young age, I was a huge Kenny Rogers fan, as I still am today. \n
EXTD=\nAs several reviwers have already pointed out "Islands in the st
EXTD=ream" (a duet with Dolly Parton) is the most populr song here, be
EXTD=ing one of the biggest hit songs for both artists (UK top 10, US 
EXTD=number 1). It is by all means a wonderfull love song by any stand
EXTD=ards but I wouldn't say it was Rogers best by a long shot, or eve
EXTD=n the best track on this album. \nAs a kid my favourite song on t
EXTD=his album was "Buried Treasure" not to be confused with the song 
EXTD="Buried treasures" Rogers recorded in the 1970s). As I get older 
EXTD=I can see all the Bee Gee-isms in this song (they wrote it, as th
EXTD=ey did with all this albums material) but it is still pure Kenny 
EXTD=Rogers. \nMy Mum used to play this album in the car when she used
EXTD=to pick my Dad up from work (In my lifetime I have owed three co
EXTD=pies - LP, Tape and now the CD) along with most of Rogers others 
EXTD=and I can remember singing along to "Evening star" and what could
EXTD=be better than driving with the windows down in a car, the cool 
EXTD=air breezing by in the summer listening to "Mid-Summer Nights", e
EXTD=specially when the lyrics are about making a journey to a better 
EXTD=life :-) \n\nThis album is mostly love songs such as, "You and I"
EXTD=, "Islands in the stream", "Midsummer nights" and "I will always 
EXTD=love you" (not to be confused with Dolly Partons own song, that w
EXTD=as later covered by Whitney Houston, Vince Gill and others includ
EXTD=ing Rogers himself for his 1997 "Love Songs" album). Infact every
EXTD=track on this album is a love song. \n\nAs mentioned before this
EXTD=album was Kenny's first for RCA in a multi-album deal that put m
EXTD=any millions into his pocket, it was a smash hit album and contai
EXTD=ned hit singles and got good reviews (even if some country critic
EXTD=s were knocking Rogers pop influence). \n\nFacts and figures asid
EXTD=e however, this is a wonderful collection of songs. Full credit t
EXTD=o The Bee Gees for the vast majority of production and song wrigh
EXTD=ting, but also full credit to Kenny Rogers, his voice, talent and
EXTD=charisma make this album just as much as The Bee Gees did.\n\n\n

EXTD=bought an LP copy of this album in 1983,the year of its release. 
EXTD=Unfortunately,due to a not-too-great sales record,this album is n

EXTD=this website. This album is one of a series of Bee Gees productio

EXTD=en many and varied in style, reflecting the widely varying styles
EXTD=of music that influenced him. He has worked in jazz, folk and co
EXTD=untry but this album is pop music at its finest, albeit with coun
EXTD=try influences. The album was produced by the Bee Gees whose own 
EXTD=musical pedigree is also varied, from their folk-pop records of t
EXTD=he sixties to their disco music of the seventies and all the dive
EXTD=rse sounds they have created since.\nThis is an almost relentless
EXTD=ly up-tempo album, Seven of the ten tracks are up-tempo with just
EXTD=two ballads (You and I, Hold me) and one mid-tempo song (I will 
EXTD=always love you). All the songs are originals and were written by
EXTD=the Bee Gees. The appearance of Dolly Parton on Islands in the s
EXTD=tream tempts you to think that I will always love you is a cover 
EXTD=of her song - it isn't, though Kenny has recorded that song too.\n
EXTD=\nThe album begins with This woman, one of the seven up-tempo son
EXTD=gs. It sets the tone of the album. Islands in the stream is, of c
EXTD=ourse, the most famous track on the album. My favorite track of a
EXTD=ll is actually Evening star (and it always was, even before any s
EXTD=ingles were released from the album, which I originally bought im
EXTD=mediately upon its release on vinyl in 1983), but the other up-te
EXTD=mpo songs - Buried treasure, Living with you, Midsummer nights an
EXTD=d Eyes that see in the dark - are all brilliant. The Bee Gees pro
EXTD=vide backup harmonies, more prominent on some tracks than others.
EXTD=Larry Gatlin also puts in a guest appearance.\n\nFor a long time
