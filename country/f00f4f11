EXTT13=Lyrics:\n\n**Goodbye Again**\n\nIt's five o'clock this morning 
EXTT13=and the sun is on the rise\nThere's frosting on the window pane
EXTT13=and sorrow in your eyes\nThe stars are fading quietly, night i
EXTT13=s nearly gone\nAnd so you turn away from me and tears begin to 
EXTT13=come\n\nAnd it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you\nGo
EXTT13=odbye again, as if you didn't know\nIt's goodbye again and I wi
EXTT13=sh you could tell me\nWhy do we always fight when I have to go?
EXTT13=\n\nIt seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and wa
EXTT13=rm\nI long to lay me down again and hold you in my arms\nI long
EXTT13=to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile\nOther voices 
EXTT13=beckon me, and for a little while\n\nIt's goodbye again, I'm so
EXTT13=rry to be leaving you\nGoodbye again, as if you didn't know\nIt
EXTT13='s goodbye again and I wish you could tell me\nWhy do we always
EXTT13=fight when I have to go?\n\nI have to go and see some friends 
EXTT13=of mine, some that I don't know\nSome who aren't familiar with 
EXTT13=my name\nIt's something that's inside of me not hard to underst
EXTT13=and\nIt's anyone who listens to me sing\n\nIf your hours are em
EXTT13=pty now, who am I to blame\nYou think if I were always here, ou
EXTT13=r love would be the same\nAs it is the time we have, is worth t
EXTT13=he time alone\nLying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever
EXTT13=known\n\nBut it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you\n
EXTT13=Goodbye again, as if you didn't know\nIt's goodbye again and I 
EXTT13=wish you could tell me\nWhy do we always fight when I have to g

EXTT14=Review: RIFF-it.\nRIFF-it good.\nListen while you read!\nThis i
EXTT14=s what it's like falling out of love\nThis is the way you lose 
EXTT14=your very best friend\nThis is how it feels when it's all over\n
EXTT14=This is just the way true love ends\n\nFirst of all there's no 
EXTT14=one you can talk to\nWhen there is they just don't seem to hear
EXTT14=\nWords don't seem to matter much anyway\nThey can't describe t
EXTT14=he pain, they can't explain the fear\n\nThen the nights grow co
EXTT14=ld and hard to live through\nAnd still you hate to see the morn
EXTT14=ing come\n'Cause somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore\n
EXTT14=The future holds no promise, your life's already done\n\nAnd th
EXTT14=is is what it's like falling out of love\nThis is the way you l
EXTT14=ose your very best friend\nThis is how it feels when it's all o
EXTT14=ver\nThis is just the way true love ends\n\nThen you find your 
EXTT14=heart no longer flutters\nAnd you no longer look through a love
EXTT14=r's eyes\n'Cause what's to see when the world goes down around 
EXTT14=you\nYou simply can't believe it, but it comes as no surprise\n
EXTT14=\n'Cause this is what it's like falling out of love\nThis is th
EXTT14=e way you lose your very best friend\nThis is how it feels when
EXTT14=it's all over\nThis is just the way true love ends\n\nWhat's t
EXTT14=he sense of failure\nIt's such an incredible loss\nIt's all the
EXTT14=things you'll never do\nAnd all the dreams that will never com
EXTT14=e true\n\nThis is what it's like falling out of love\nThis is t
EXTT14=he way you lose your very best friend\nThis is how it feels whe
EXTT14=n it's all over\nThis is just the way true love ends\nOh this i
EXTT14=s just the way a true love ends\nI don't believe a true love ev
EXTT14=er ends\nOh no, oh no, no, no, no, no\n************************

EXTT15=Lyrics:\n\n**Love is the Master**\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago\n
EXTT15=I came here for the very first time\nLooking up at the Spanish 
EXTT15=window\nFrom a trail on the edge of the timberline\n\nI've been
EXTT15=off on a journey to find myself\nMaybe find my way back home\n
EXTT15=Been many an hour all by myself\nIn the darkest of nights, I wa
EXTT15=s never ever alone\n\nBack in the San Juan Mountains again\nOn 
EXTT15=a ride with some good old boys\nTelling stories around a campfi
EXTT15=re\nThe sound of laughter is the loudest noise\n\nThere's somet
EXTT15=hing in a night in the wilderness\nIt's a magical thing to me\n
EXTT15=Like the sky is just a little bit brighter\nAnd your life is ev
EXTT15=erything that you'd like it to be\n\nThere'll be snow on the pa
EXTT15=sses tomorrow\nYou can feel it in the chill of the wind\nLet th
EXTT15=e rain wash away all my sorrow\nToday is the day that my life s
EXTT15=tarts all over again\n\nI guess that it's just about over now\n
EXTT15=Everything's about to change\nEverything's a brand new number, 
EXTT15=darlin'\nEverything's a brand new game\n\nAnd it's funny I coul
EXTT15=d even call you that\nAfter all the pain we've been through\nAh
EXTT15=, but time is the master of healing\nLove is the master of ever
EXTT15=ything that we do\n\nThere'll be snow on the passes tomorrow\nY
EXTT15=ou can feel it in the chill of the wind\nLet the rain wash away
EXTT15=all my sorrow\nToday is the day that my life starts all over a

EXTT16=Lyrics:\n\n**Seasons of the Heart**\n\nOf course we have our di
EXTT16=fferences, you shouldn't be surprised\nIt's as natural as chang
EXTT16=es in the seasons and the skies\nSometimes we grow together, so
EXTT16=metimes we drift apart\nA wiser man than I might know the seaso
EXTT16=ns of the heart\n\nAnd I'm walking here beside you in the early
EXTT16=evening chill\nA thing we've always loved to do, I know we alw
EXTT16=ays will\nWe have so much in common, so many things we share\nT
EXTT16=hat I can't believe my heart when it implies that you're not th

EXTT16=the reason I must go\nLove is all I ever hoped to find here\nLo
EXTT16=ve is still the only dream I know\n\nSo I don't know how to tel
EXTT16=l you, it's difficult to say\nI never in my wildest dreams imag
EXTT16=ined it this way\nBut sometimes I just don't know you, there's 
EXTT16=a stranger in our home\nWhen I'm lying right beside you is when
EXTT16=I'm most alone\n\nAnd I think my heart is broken, there's an e
EXTT16=mptiness inside\nSo many things I've longed for have so often b
EXTT16=een denied\nStill I, I wouldn't try to change you there's no on
EXTT16=e that's to blame\nIt's just some things that mean so much and 
EXTT16=we just don't feel the same\n\nLove is why I came here in the f
EXTT16=irst place\nLove is now the reason I must go\nLove is all I eve
EXTT16=r hoped to find here\nLove is still the only dream I know\nTrue
EXTT16=love is still the only dream I know\n*************************
