EXTD=gust 24, 2004\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Released in late 1976, at th
EXTD=e height of Willie mania, The Troublemaker is Willie Nelson's fir
EXTD=st all-gospel album, but country gospel in his hands doesn't soun
EXTD=d like traditional country gospel -- it's a Willie album, through
EXTD=and through, performed with the freewheeling Family as support. 
EXTD=Consequently, it's every bit as wonderfully idiosyncratic as any 
EXTD=of his other mid-'70s work and, in some ways, even more so, becau
EXTD=se inspirational songs and religious material are usually not giv
EXTD=en arrangements as imaginative and free-spirited as this. Althoug
EXTD=h the album can be divided pretty evenly between ballads and roll
EXTD=icking up-tempo numbers, there is the inherent jazz-like unpredic
EXTD=tability in the performances of Nelson and his band that makes ev
EXTD=en familiar numbers like "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" sound spon
EXTD=taneous. Then again, the choice of material also helps, because t
EXTD=hat song is the most familiar here - while many of the other numbe
EXTD=rs are also country gospel standards, they're not recorded nearly
EXTD=as often as "Circle" and these song choices also give The Troubl
EXTD=emaker a unique, fresh feel. Another interesting thing about the 
EXTD=album is that the music, not the message, is at the forefront, wh
EXTD=ich is why it doesn't sound separate from his other mid-'70s peak
EXTD=s. Although it is overshadowed by them both, the sublime subtlety
EXTD=of the performances on The Troublemaker make it sound of a piece
EXTD=with The Red Headed Stranger and Stardust. It may not be nearly 
EXTD=as popular as either, but musically, it's just as satisfying and 
EXTD=is one of the quiet highlights in Willie's vast catalog.  -- Step

EXTD=lson has a reputation as an outlaw, and his fabled brushes with l
EXTD=aw and order are a part of the public record, so from its title, 
EXTD=one might suspect that 1976's THE TROUBLEMAKER is chock-full of s
EXTD=ongs about getting into trouble. But one would be wrong. There is
EXTD=no "Whiskey River" here. In fact, the record's lone rebel song i
EXTD=s the haunting, spare title track, whose central character is "no
EXTD=thin' but the troublemakin' kind," and ends up nailed to a cross 
EXTD=at Calvary.\n\nThis is a sincerely religious record. Typical song
EXTD=titles are: "When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder" and "Where the S
EXTD=oul Never Dies." Sin, salvation, and eternal life are recurring t
EXTD=hemes. And yet, because Nelson has a way of making anything he to
