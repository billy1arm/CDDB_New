EXTD=in the Dark represented a high watermark for Kenny Rogers, getti
EXTD=ng everything about a pop crossover right, its 1984 sequel, What 
EXTD=About Me?, pretty much gets everything wrong. First of all, losin
EXTD=g the writing talents of the Brothers Gibb is a major blow, since
EXTD=they not only gave Kenny indelible singles with "Islands in the 
EXTD=Stream" and "Buried Treasure," they gave him a strong, consistent
EXTD=set of songs. This, released just a year later, is a return to s
EXTD=ingles 'n' filler, which is not unheard of in either country-pop 
EXTD=or in Rogers' catalog, and sometimes it can even make for an enjo
EXTD=yable listen, provided that the singles are strong enough and tha
EXTD=t the overall sound of the record is appealing. Neither is the ca
EXTD=se here. The singles are not memorable -- the closest is the titl
EXTD=e track, featuring not just Kim Carnes but James Ingram in a song
EXTD=that doesn't quite make sense as a duet, let alone a trio -- and
EXTD=the production, which abandons any pretense at country, is too c
EXTD=alculatingly adult contemporary - instead of having a nice, soothi
EXTD=ng, synth-heavy feel like Eyes That See in the Dark, this sounds 
EXTD=cold and clean, typifying the worst in mid-'80s adult contemporar
EXTD=y. And make no mistake, this is not a country album at all -- it 
EXTD=may have charted on the country charts, but that was due to caree
EXTD=r momentum, because this is an adult contemporary album, and a ba
EXTD=d one at that. It's a depressing comedown after the splendid Eyes

EXTD=M CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSimply THE Best Kenny Rogers Album of All Time
EXTD=!!!, July 10, 2005\nReviewer: T. Geer (Johnson City, TN]\n\nI rem
EXTD=ember buying this album during the 80's, and I thought then that 
EXTD=this was Kenny Rogers' best album up to that time. Well, it's 200
EXTD=5, and I still think this way! Kenny Rogers teamed up with David 
EXTD=Foster for this album, and they made quite a team! Anything that 
EXTD=David Foster produces is very good, but this is an excellent exam
EXTD=ple of Foster's earlier years of producing albums. \nThe title so
EXTD=ng with Kim Carnes and James Ingram was simply among the best in 
EXTD=Rogers' history - Richard Marx co-wrote this song along with Roger
EXTD=s and Foster. Then there was "The Stranger" written by Dolly Part
EXTD=on about a man leaving his wife and children behind - very eerie, 
EXTD=but very good! \nDefinitely five stars for this album!!! \n\n\nHa
EXTD=lf.com Album Notes\nWHAT ABOUT ME? is a ten-song 1984 album from 
EXTD=country-pop crooner Kenny Rogers, highlighted by "Crazy" and the
