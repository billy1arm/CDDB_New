EXTD=ition Released May 21, 1997 (Japan]\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Perhap
EXTD=s John Denver's worst-selling album, Whose Garden Was This, is la
EXTD=rgely a record of cover songs, starting with the Tom Paxton-penne
EXTD=d environmentalist anthem that is the title track, and including 
EXTD=Denver versions of such songs as the Band's "The Night They Drove
EXTD=Old Dixie Down," Jerry Jeff Walker's "Mr. Bojangles," The Beatle
EXTD=s' "Eleanor Rigby," and "Golden Slumbers." Denver's own contribut
EXTD=ions included the awkward "I Wish I Could Have Been There (Woodst
EXTD=ock)." Though Denver tried in a sleeve note to weave all this int
EXTD=o a theme, something about "all the things that change as we grow
EXTD=older." In fact, Whose Garden Was This was an expendable collect
EXTD=ion of second-rate Denver songs and first-rate songs done better 
EXTD=by others. Not surprisingly, it missed the charts.  -- William Ru

EXTD=looked contribution..., May 30, 2006 \nBy  The Professor (Dayton 
EXTD=OH]\n\nI could not help but write this review in response to the 
EXTD=2 existing reviews. Yes there is a seriousness to this album that
EXTD=is somewhat uncharacteristic of the John Denver that became famo
EXTD=us, but this is an extremely important work in the progression of
EXTD=his career. The artist at this point is a mid-twenties up and co
EXTD=ming folksinger (this is the predecessor of his breakout, Poems, 
EXTD=Prayers, and Promises). Whose Garden Was This establishes Denver's 
EXTD=mastery of covers (Lennon/McCartney, Tom Paxton, etc.) with some 
EXTD=fairly interesting arrrangements of Eleanor Rigby, Mr Bojangles (
EXTD=I do agree with the one reviewer that this one is better than the
EXTD=NGDB's version and would add that this is the definitive version
EXTD=of this song), etc. The originals are strong as well. Sail Away 
EXTD=Home is appropriately dark, but not without optimism. Yes the hig
EXTD=h-voiced female singers were a bit much, but a sign of the times.
EXTD=The song is timeless and with some updated production would soun
EXTD=d as if it were written yesterday. Yes if you are looking for lat
EXTD=er day John Denver (that singer who enjoyed great commercial succ
EXTD=ess at the cost of becoming a caricature of himself), don't buy t
EXTD=his album. If, on the other hand, you want a glimpse of a young a
EXTD=rtist genuinely exploring his singing, poetry, and developing soc
EXTD=ial/environmental consciousness, get this album. Then make certai
EXTD=n you put this, Aerie (probably his best), and Farewell Andromeda
EXTD=right alongside Poems, Prayers, and Promises and Rocky Mountain Hi
EXTD=gh. These albums are John Denver... at his artistic best. \n\n\nA

EXTD=ng, May 14, 2010 \nBy  Charles - Music Lover (Phoenix, AZ, USA]\n
EXTD=\n"Whose Garden Was This" seems to be a little-known recording in
EXTD=John Denver's overall output. This strikes me as a shame, becaus
EXTD=e the recording is a top-notch collection. What this recording la
EXTD=cks in polish it makes up for in authenticity. \n\nDenver sounds 
EXTD=looser in his interpretations of folk-rock standards on this albu
EXTD=m than he did in later releases (I estimate that I've heard about
EXTD=half of his recordings). One writer called "Mr. Bojangles" a def
EXTD=initive recording of the song and I heartily agree. His interpret
EXTD=ations of "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" and "Eleanor Rigb
EXTD=y" are also striking. \n\nFor those who haven't heard "Whose Gard
EXTD=en Was This," you are definitely in for a surprise. Released in 1
EXTD=970 before Denver rocketed to super-stardom, you hear an artist u
EXTD=nburdened with commercial constraints. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER 
EXTD=REVIEW\nNot John's best, August 16, 2005 \nBy  Kenneth R. Blaker 
EXTD=Jr. "JOHNNYROCKS" (KENTUCKY]\n\nI am a hugh John Denver fan. I bo
EXTD=ught this album many years ago. I believe the year was 1977. I ha
EXTD=d heard several other albums by John at this time in my life and 
EXTD=loved everything about his music. Until I played this one. I agre
EXTD=e with the last reviewer. It is too dark and gloomy. I like to th
EXTD=ink of John as a positve and uplifting singer/song writer. I boug
EXTD=ht the CD to make my collection complete. However, if you are loo
EXTD=king for a inspiring, uplifting John Denver album this one is not
EXTD=for you. Although, I try to look for positive messages in all of
EXTD=John's music, and there is some positve messages here for it's t
EXTD=ime. I don't believe the ocassional John Denver listener will enj
EXTD=oy this recording as much as some later recordings. Try his "Spir
EXTD=it" album, or his "I Want To Live" album. With these recordings y
EXTD=ou can't go wrong. They truly are, "FAR OUT"! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CU
EXTD=STOMER REVIEW\nThe John Denver many fans did not acknowledge, Feb
EXTD=ruary 5, 2008 \nBy  The Gent "May God Bless You - )" (Sacramento 
EXTD=CA USA]\n\nThis John Denver existed - whether some of his fans li
EXTD=ked it or not. He was given to mood swings - his music showed tha
EXTD=t. The reviewers who don't like this album probably don't like "T
EXTD=ake Me to Tomorrow" (not on CD - Albumhunter offers the LP thru A
EXTD=mazon) either. But I see traces of this album in many of the albu
EXTD=ms John's fans prefer to listen to. Or do you just pretend that s
EXTD=ongs like "Prisoners", "Paradise", "Angels from Montgomery", "Ple
EXTD=ase Daddy (Don't get Drunk this Christmas)" or the "Readjustment 
EXTD=Blues" don't exist? The compilations do John a serious disservice
EXTD=by ignoring this side of his personality. When I listen to John 
EXTD=sing "Carolina in My Mind" I hear him acknowledging that he and J
EXTD=ames Taylor had much more in common than just being singer-songwr
EXTD=iters. And his version has a LOT more sting than Taylor's. I gues
EXTD=s I am different from a lot of fans. I liked John - warts and all
EXTD=And he never shied from his warts. That makes me like him even 
EXTD=more.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nFor collectors and die-har
EXTD=d fans only., June 27, 2005 \nBy  Bob Dunkin "Troubador" (Colorad
EXTD=o]\n\nSo, why only 2 stars from an obviously devoted JD fan? Beca
EXTD=use I respect truth and quality and beautiful music too much to t
EXTD=ell you it's good if it isn't. I'm not saying it's all bad. There
EXTD=are some redeeming moments ("Mr. Bojangles" is better than the f
EXTD=amous version by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), but I'm afraid they are
EXTD=outnumbered on this album. The production is tasteful, the perfo
EXTD=rmances professional, arrangements are well done. The problem is 
EXTD=the material. \n\nThe theme here is the environment, or the "ecol
EXTD=ogy" as it was called in the 70s, with occasional forays into the
EXTD=social/political arena. "Sail Away Home" is a war protest song, 
EXTD=delivered in blues/rock style, with a gospel choir in the backgro
EXTD=und. Along the same vein is "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"
EXTD=, which seems to be patterned after The Band's version. The title
EXTD=cut, written by Tom Paxton, is sung in bitter remembrance of a w
EXTD=orld where once there were flowers and blue skies and white snow 
EXTD=and fresh air, and now it's all gone. "Old Folks" is a spooky, fa
EXTD=talistic view of aging, featuring the lines, "They tremble as the
EXTD=y watch the old silver clock when day is through - Tick-tocks oh 
EXTD=so slow - it says yes, it says no - It says 'I wait for you'". Ev
EXTD=en "Jingle Bells" is given a morbid treatment here, with much the
EXTD=same sentiment as the aforementioned Tom Paxton song. \n\nJohn h
EXTD=imself later proved that the enviroment theme can be done in a mu
EXTD=ch more appealing style, as it was on the "Earth Songs" album. Th
EXTD=is project is gloomy and depressing throughout, and even John's m
EXTD=asterful singing can't make it an enjoyable listening experience.
EXTD=Try another one of his albums. ANY other album.
