EXTD=lf after the release of her first studio recording in six years, 
EXTD=and perhaps her finest recording since 1975's Diamonds and Rust, Jo
EXTD=an Baez's complete A&M recordings offer a revelatory view of the 
EXTD=artist at her most adventurous. Baez's tenure with A&M lasted fro
EXTD=m 1972-1976 and yielded five studio albums, a live recording, and
EXTD=three non-album singles. All of them are included here on four C
EXTD=Ds with gorgeously remastered sound, a deluxe package with exhaus
EXTD=tive, insightful, and unflinching liner notes by Arthur Levy, and
EXTD=a package that should win a Grammy for design and presentation i
EXTD=f nothing else. \n\nBaez, regarded in the popular culture at larg
EXTD=e as a "folk" or "topical" singer (the latter term she would not 
EXTD=refute, the former hasn't fit her for some time), has always been
EXTD=a restless artist. This box set offers proof that Baez's switch 
EXTD=to A&M -- then an independent, now swallowed whole by Universal -
EXTD=from Vanguard, facilitated a virtual renaissance for her not ju
EXTD=st creatively, but on the charts as well. This reappraisal is nec
EXTD=essary, given Baez's most recent recordings have reflected anothe
EXTD=r shift in her sound and concerns, away from being a songwriter t
EXTD=o being an interpreter of fine, edgy, roots songs by a whole slew
EXTD=of younger writers -- and her seeming embrace of the electric gu
EXTD=itar. The earliest evidence of Baez's rambling vision can be hear
EXTD=d on her experimental album Baptism, from 1968. Upon moving to A&
EXTD=M, and recording from her Nashville studio base, Baez released he
EXTD=r self-produced Come From The Shadows (with help from Norbert Put
EXTD=nam), featuring -- like her latter day Vanguard recordings -- a h
EXTD=ost of Nashville's finest musicians, which included David Paul Br
EXTD=iggs, Pete Drake, Kenneth A. Buttrey, Charlie McCoy, and Grady Ma
EXTD=rtin. It was certainly a political record, but it also included t
EXTD=he stunning "Love Song To A Stranger," and her sister Mimi Fariï¿½a
EXTD='s "In The Quiet Morning," written in memory of Janis Joplin. \n\n
EXTD=The other half of Disc One is comprised of Where Are You Now, My 
EXTD=Son from 1973, co-produced by Baez and Henry Lewy. It included a 
EXTD=slew of originals by Baez, including the title track, a pair of s
EXTD=ongs by Fariï¿½a, and Hoyt Axton's "Less Than A Song." Most importa
EXTD=ntly, it was a move toward something outside of the country-rock 
EXTD=realm she'd been toying with. That "something" first occurs on Di
EXTD=sc Two with her traditional album of Latin folk and topical songs
EXTD=from Gracias a la Vida, and, of course, 1975's Diamonds and Rust
EXTD=with David Kershenbaum helping her out in the production room. T
EXTD=he latter album, heard so many years after the fact of its incept
EXTD=ion and release, has Baez experimenting with soul -- Stevie Wonde
EXTD=r's "Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer" - hard country: Dickey B
EXTD=etts' "Blue Sky," - and moving around toward Dylan once again, as 
EXTD=she was part of the Rolling Thunder Review, with a stellar versio
EXTD=n of "Simple Twist Of Fate," as well as the legendary title track
EXTD=Along with it, Baez wrote four songs, and recorded others by Jo
EXTD=hn Prine, and Jackson Browne, and offered a deeply moving renditi
EXTD=on of Stephen Foster's "I Dream of Jeannie" melded with "Danny Bo
EXTD=y." It was the masterpiece that both critics and fans knew she wa
EXTD=s capable of delivering and had been leading up to since Blessed 
EXTD=Are.., her final album for Vanguard. It, along with most everythi
EXTD=ng here, has aged well and endures. Disc Three features the secon
EXTD=d half of Diamonds and Rust, and another fine, if criminally unde
EXTD=r-appreciated, album Gulf Winds, released in October of 1976 and 
EXTD=comprised entirely of Baez originals. \n\nDisc Four features one 
EXTD=of the best live recordings from the 1970s, From Every Stage, com
EXTD=piled from a handful of shows and not enhanced in any way. Some o
EXTD=f the members of her road band included no less than one of Motow
EXTD=n's Funk Brothers in bassist James Jamerson, drummer Jim Gordon, 
EXTD=pianist David Briggs, and guitarist Larry Carlton. Moving across 
EXTD=the space of her entire career, it is a moving, engaging, and utt
EXTD=erly transcendent recording, offered in an era when live records 
EXTD=sucked -- they were no longer live but edited heavily in the stud
EXTD=io. This box features each album's original liner notes, as well 
EXTD=as a host of stunning photographs. But besides the elegant packag
EXTD=e, the music tells the story of an artist who pushed herself beyo
EXTD=nd the laurels of her living legend, who worked at trying to find
EXTD=, in the swirling winds of change, a complexity outside her accep

EXTD=herself as an artist. The evidence is in: she succeeded in spades

EXTD=N/A\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (Diamonds and Rust)  With the Vietnam Wa
EXTD=r winding down, Joan Baez, who had devoted one side of her last a
EXTD=lbum to her trip to Hanoi, delivered the kind of commercial album
EXTD=A&M Records must have wanted when it signed her three years earl
EXTD=ier. But she did it on her own terms, putting together a session 
EXTD=band of contemporary jazz veterans like Larry Carlton, Wilton Fel
EXTD=der, and Joe Sample, and mixing a wise selection from the work of
EXTD=current singer-songwriters like Jackson Browne and John Prine wi
EXTD=th pop covers of Stevie Wonder and the Allman Brothers Band, and 
EXTD=an unusually high complement of her own writing. A&M, no doubt re
EXTD=calling the success of her cover of the Band's "The Night They Dr
EXTD=ove Old Dixie Down," released her version of the Allmans' "Blue S
EXTD=ky" as a single, and it got halfway up the charts. But the real h
EXTD=it was the title track, a self-penned masterpiece on the singer's
EXTD=favorite subject, her relationship with Bob Dylan. Outdoing the 
EXTD=current crop of confessional singer/songwriters at soul baring, B
EXTD=aez sang to Dylan, reminiscing about her '60s love affair with hi
EXTD=m intensely, affectionately, and unsentimentally. It was her fine
EXTD=st moment as a songwriter and one of her finest performances, per
EXTD=iod, and when A&M finally released it on 45, it made the Top 40, 
EXTD=propelling the album to gold status. But those who bought the dis
EXTD=c for "Diamonds and Rust" also got to hear "Winds of the Old Days,"
EXTD=in which Baez forgave Dylan for abandoning the protest movement,
EXTD=as well as the jazzy "Children and All That Jazz," a delightful 
EXTD=song about motherhood, and the wordless vocals of "Dida," a duet 
EXTD=with Joni Mitchell accompanied by Mitchell's backup band, Tom Sco
EXTD=tt and the L.A. Express. The cover songs were typically accomplis
EXTD=hed, making this the strongest album of Baez's post-folk career.

EXTD=Listening to this album a quarter century after the fact is an ee

EXTD=, but nothing of that album except the title track is represented
EXTD=here - rather, Baez performs five Bob Dylan songs (which get the 
EXTD=most rousing reception), three of her better originals, including
EXTD="Blessed Are" and "Diamonds and Rust," and a brace of traditiona
EXTD=l songs and covers of a handful of other composers' work, includi

EXTD=outpouring of political venom, there's not too much controversy h

EXTD=nzett," dedicated to political prisoners and an ambitious but ult
EXTD=imately awkward adaptation of "Stewball" are as topical as most o
EXTD=f the show gets. Baez is in superb voice and the backing septet, 
EXTD=mostly heard on the second disc, has a surprisingly lean sound. U
EXTD=ltimately, From Every Stage is a good, albeit far slicker follow-
EXTD=up to Baez's two early-'60s live albums on Vanguard, though it sa
EXTD=ys something about the nature of her history at A&M Records that

EXTD=dmark Diamonds and Rust found her at the peak of her singer/songwri
EXTD=ter skills, seemingly capable of transitioning out of '60s protes
EXTD=t mode into a more contemporary and commercially viable position.
EXTD=It was also around this time that she toured with Bob Dylan's Ro
EXTD=lling Thunder Revue, and according to Baez's memoirs, she wrote t
EXTD=he songs for Gulf Winds during that tour. But Gulf Winds, her las
EXTD=t A&M album, was a significant drop off and marked the beginning 
EXTD=of what would be a steep commercial decline. Produced by David Ke
EXTD=rshenbaum, the album tries its best to bolster Baez with a timely
EXTD='70s studio sound, but for the most part it misses the mark. The
EXTD=songs just aren't up to the task. "Sweeter for Me" sports a nice
EXTD=arppegiated piano by Baez and faintly harks to the melancholy br
EXTD=illiance of Diamonds and Rust, but, lyrically, most of the material
EXTD=is overwritten. The more stinging, faster-paced "O Brother!" is 
EXTD=a more successful stab at a commercial sound, and Baez sings it w
EXTD=ith a bitter venom (you can't help but speculate that the song re
EXTD=fers to Dylan himself). The standout track on an otherwise forget
EXTD=table album, though, is surely the title track, "Gulf Winds," a t
EXTD=en-and-a-half-minute solo epic in the mold of her early work, jus
EXTD=t Joan and her acoustic guitar, brilliantly picked and sung, iron
EXTD=ically demonstrating that, although Baez still had the talent, sh

EXTD=\nBy  dree85 (Cambridge, MA United States)  \nI must admit I have

EXTD=have it to keep for all time, and digitally remastered no less. F

EXTD=ew have the ability to write lyrics that have all the eloquence a
EXTD=nd imagery of poetry, but with a down to earth message that make 
EXTD=you feel as if she read your mind. Joan Baez is blessed with both
EXTD=gifts, as self-penned songs "Diamonds and Rust", "Time Is Passin
EXTD=g Us By", and "Gulf Winds" indicate. As several other reviewers h
EXTD=ave pointed out, the packaging is a bit poor, but this is vastly 
EXTD=overshadowed by the insightful liner notes (and of course the son
EXTD=gs themselves). I would give this amazing album 6 stars out of 5

EXTD=USTOMER REVIEW (This Compilation]\nA Welcome Addition to the Baez
EXTD=Catalog, October 1, 2003 \nBy A Customer\nAt last, the albums "W
EXTD=here Are You Now, My Son?" and "Gulf Winds" on CD. The deleted "C
EXTD=ome from the Shadows" is also included. Unfortunately, all six of
EXTD=Joan Baez's A&M albums are crammed onto 4 CDs. It is convenient 
EXTD=to have "From Every Stage," previously released as a double set, 
EXTD=on one disc - but the combination of fragments of other albums is 
EXTD=less than ideal. Song titles and track numbers are not listed on 
EXTD=the discs, only in the booklet. The package seems designed for an
EXTD=epic listening session. The presumably-reduced price can be cons
EXTD=idered a plus for this configuration.\nThe sound is much improved
EXTD=from the earlier CD releases. Baez's voice is captured in all it
EXTD=s middle-period shimmering richness and still-soaring purity. The
EXTD=instrumental details sound bright and clear. The liner notes are
EXTD=informative, and accurate (not always the case with A&M's Baez c
EXTD=ompilations). The author may make too much of Baez's re-connectio
EXTD=n to Bob Dylan during this time. The over-riding theme of her A&M
EXTD=years was political activism--from protest of the Vietnam war to
EXTD=involvement in the human rights movement. This was much more exp
EXTD=licit than in her Vanguard years. As for continued relevance, the
EXTD=title song of "Where Are You Now, My Son?" can sadly apply to th
EXTD=e current Iraq situation. This is not to ignore Baez's increasing
EXTD=skills as a writer and interpreter of non-political songs during
EXTD=this period. "Gulf Winds" is comprised of solely self-written ma
EXTD=terial. New interviews with Baez and her producers were conducted
EXTD=It would have been interesting to get Herb Alpert's take as a l
EXTD=abel founder on these years of her career. Most of the booklet ph
EXTD=otographs a fan will have already seen, but they are attractively
EXTD=presented. The original credits and liner notes are also include
EXTD=d, but not the song lyrics.\n\nOne disappointment is the lack of 
EXTD=previously-unreleased material. Of the three non-album singles: t
EXTD=wo are already available on other compilations. "Where's My Apple
EXTD=Pie?" is the only unheard song a die-hard fan will find here. I 
EXTD=guess I'm spoiled by the Vanguard reissues with their--so far--ge
EXTD=nerous bonus tracks. Were there no unreleased songs from the "Fro
EXTD=m Every Stage" concerts? Combined with the new "Dark Chords on a 
EXTD=Big Guitar" CD, this box set showcases the talent of a singer and
EXTD=songwriter not only engaged with the world, but willing to try i

EXTD=\nBy  Jay L. Rudko (Pembroke Pines, FL USA) \nI don't think anyo
EXTD=ne can argue that "Diamonds and Rust" was Joan's finest album. I 
EXTD=believe it was also her best selling album since her earliest Van
EXTD=guard recordings. Her work during her tenure with A&M represents 
EXTD=some of the best of her career. And that label gave her the treat
EXTD=ment she deserved. I purchased the "Come from the Shadows" album 
EXTD=first on a QS quad LP, and the sound blew me away. I was already 
EXTD=a JB fan, but this more than cemented my fandom. I somehow missed
EXTD="Where Are You Now, My Son", but was glad to have it on this set
EXTD="Gulf Winds" was another favorite of mine, especially the track
EXTD="Caruso". I had all of these on vinyl - now, on these remastered 
EXTD=CD's, the music and all the subtleties show through even better t
EXTD=han ever. I have to agree with the reviewers who were less than s
EXTD=atisfied with the packaging. I, too, would have liked to see the 
EXTD=tracks listed on each disc. I would have also liked for these dis

EXTD=um, including a cover of Bob Dylan's "Forever Young", and Baez or
EXTD=iginals "Where's My Apple Pie" and "Johnny I Hardly Knew Yeh". \n
EXTD=\nAfter a dozen years on Vanguard Records, her first effort for A
EXTD=&M was the politically-charged Come In From The Shadows. The albu
EXTD=m became notable not only for its' heavy Nashville influence, but
EXTD=also for the bold "Song Of Bangladesh," her open letter to Dylan
EXTD=on "Bobby," as well as the cover of John Lennon's "Imagine". \n\n
EXTD=\nThis was followed by Where Are You Now My Son?, which quickly b
EXTD=ecame controversial due to her strident viewpoints on the continu
EXTD=ing conflicts in Southeast Asia. The title track is a 26-minute s
EXTD=emi-biographical epic, with ambient sounds documented by Baez in 
EXTD=Hanoi, Vietnam during the final weeks of 1972. Its' brutal honest
EXTD=y did not sit well with many, although it re-established her as a
EXTD=key political and musical conduit. \n\n\nThis was followed by Gr
EXTD=acias A La Vida (Here's To Life) which took an artistic detour as
EXTD=it was recorded in Spanish. It became no less of a controversial
EXTD=statement, containing a version of the Pablo Neruda poem "No Nos
EXTD=Moveran (We Shall Not Be Moved)". The government of Spain banned
EXTD=the work and it was deleted from subsequent pressings. \n\nThe b
EXTD=rilliant and mostly non-political Diamonds and Rust became not only
EXTD=a touchstone for Baez, but was also considered essential listeni
EXTD=ng in the mid 1970s. It remains resonant with the Dylan-influence
EXTD=d title composition, and the covers of Janis Ian's "Jessie," Jack
EXTD=son Browne's "Fountain Of Sorrow," the Allman Brothers' "Blue Sky
EXTD=" and John Prine's "Hello In There." \n\n\nHer last studio offeri
EXTD=ng for A&M was Gulf Wind. It yielded considerably lighter fare, r
EXTD=eflecting much of the same escapism and ennui America was concurr
EXTD=ently enduring. One of the most outstanding elements is the pleth
EXTD=ora of strong originals. Chief among them are "Oh Brother!" -- an
EXTD=admitted response to Dylan's "Oh Sister" -- and the picturesque 
EXTD=title song, which Baez claims as having been influenced by an exp
EXTD=erience during Dylan's all-star Rolling Thunder Review tour. \n\n
EXTD=\nAlthough technically From Every Stage was issued before Gulf Wi
EXTD=nds, for the sake of continuity the double-LP live collection con
EXTD=cludes The Complete A&M Recordings (1972 -- 1976). Baez is spotli
EXTD=ghted in both acoustic as well as band settings. Her repertoire a
EXTD=t the time included tunes dating back to her days on Vanguard -- 
EXTD=such as "Stewball" and "Blessed Are .." as well as a few that had
EXTD=yet to be recorded by Baez before. Among them were the civil rig
EXTD=hts anthem "(Ain't Gonna Let Nobody) Turn Me Around," and a readi
EXTD=ng of "Blowin' In The Wind" which would be used in the film Forre
EXTD=st Gump during the March On Washington scene. \n\n\nThe sound is
