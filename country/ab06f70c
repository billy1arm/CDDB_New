EXTD=Sound of Jeannie C. Riley is a reissue of her first album for Lit
EXTD=tle Darlin', an album called Sock Soul that was released in 1968.
EXTD=As Tom Kittypaw points out in the liner notes, this is not that 
EXTD=version of the LP, but instead a reconfigured version of the 12 s
EXTD=ongs that Capitol released in 1969 under the title of The Songs o
EXTD=f Jeannie C. Riley, after she became a star in the wake of the sm
EXTD=ash hit "Harper Valley PTA." The 12 songs that comprise this LP a
EXTD=re more straightforward country, even veering toward honky tonk, 
EXTD=than the music that made her a star, but that's hardly to say tha
EXTD=t this is hardcore country -- after all, the verses on "You've Go
EXTD=t Me Singing Nursery Rhymes" are punctuated by both steel guitar 
EXTD=and electric sitar. Nevertheless, this album does fit into both t
EXTD=he "Little Darlin' sound" -- a blend of ballads, novelties, and T
EXTD=exas two-steps -- and the contemporary sound of the late '60s, wh
EXTD=ich slyly incorporated such hip flourishes as those sitars. While
EXTD=there are no knockout songs here, the 12 tunes are solid -- part
EXTD=icularly Ed Bruce's "The Price I Pay to Stay" and the Johnny Payc
EXTD=heck songs "The Heart He Kicks Around" and "You've Got Me Singing
EXTD=Nursery Rhymes" (the latter co-written by Little Darlin' head ho
EXTD=ncho Aubrey Mayhew) -- but the appeal of this album lies in how i
EXTD=t captures Riley as a raw, emerging talent and how it captures th
EXTD=e sound of its time. So, it's an artifact, for Riley fans and afi
EXTD=cionados of good, albeit generic, late-'60s country, but for thos
EXTD=e two camps, this is certainly more than worthwhile.  -- Stephen

EXTD=A. and this album "The Songs of Jeannie C. Riley" both came out 
EXTD=in 1968. This was demo work that Little Darlin' put out after her
EXTD=Harper success. My two favorite songs from this album and from h

EXTD=I'll be a Woman of the World and How can anything so right be so 
EXTD=wrong. She wouldn't write her own songs again till she joined MGM
EXTD=in the 70's. In some ways this album sounds more like traditiona

EXTD=le. After all Tom T. Hall wrote some of her best songs. This is h

EXTD=mixed sound messes up the album's original integrity, May 10, 200

EXTD=brey Mayhew commissioned KOCH Nashville to release to cd several 
EXTD=cds of music from his Little Darlin' record label, as well as mus
EXTD=ic from his Certron record label reissued under the Little Darlin
EXTD=' label, I thought it would be great to finally get some of the m
EXTD=usic on cd. However, I have problems with the music that was rele
EXTD=ased on this particular cd. \n\nBasically, here are the problems 
EXTD=that appear to be evident with every single song: Every single so
EXTD=ng runs faster on the cd than the original lp plays when it is ru
EXTD=nning at the proper speed. \n\nThe songs are also all remixed. I 
EXTD=don't necessarily believe everything is from master tapes as I he
EXTD=ard vinyl noise on The Heart He Kicks Around, and even a little b
EXTD=it on The Price I Pay To Stay, but some of the songs all also hav
EXTD=e annoying background vocals that were not on the original lp at 
EXTD=all, and the fiddles and small electric guitar parts have all bee
EXTD=n replaced on the cd version with an annoying twangy guitar sound
EXTD=similar to the guitar from Harper Valley PTA. I don't know when 
EXTD=the instrumentation or stereo mixes were changed or when the back
EXTD=ground vocals were added, but they are most definitely not on the
EXTD=original "Little Darlin'" lp release. \n\nThe Price I Pay To Sta
EXTD=y in particular sounds a lot different on the cd as it is upbeat 
EXTD=there, it was not quite as upbeat on the original lp. The stereo 
EXTD=version of the song on this cd matches the mono version found on 
EXTD=the 45 Capitol 2378. \n\nLastly, what's with the song "You've Got
EXTD=Me Singing Nursery Rhymes"?? The original lp had the song "Or Is
EXTD=It Love" in it's place, and i think I prefer that one to this so
EXTD=ng. 'Nursery Rhymes' was first issued as the B side to her 2nd an
EXTD=d last Capitol 45, #2449. They should've left "Or Is It Love" on 
EXTD=this cd. Not to mention that the track order on the cd is not the
EXTD=same as on the original lp. \n\nThese songs were recorded as dem
EXTD=os for Aubrey Mayhew who recorded her before anyone else had (or 
EXTD=so the original Little Darlin' lp states) (I don't know how she e
EXTD=nded up recording for Mayhew but I've heard stories of her being 
EXTD=cheated out of royalties from the songs that came from those sess
EXTD=ions, and probably from this cd too), but when two 45 rpm release
EXTD=s on Little Darlin' in 1967 did nothing (all 4 of those sides are
EXTD=on this cd), she switched over to Plantation Records where she f
EXTD=inally reached success. The Little Darlin' lp was released after 
EXTD=her success with Harper Valley PTA to cash in on it, which is eve
EXTD=n more evident on the cd re-release of these songs by making them
EXTD=all sound like that hit. \n\nI don't know what recording masters
EXTD=Aubrey Mayhew sent to KOCH to put out for this cd, but they are 
EXTD=not the original album mixes, which makes this entire cd almost w
EXTD=orth avoiding entirely. If a vinyl source was in fact used to mas
EXTD=ter this cd reissue, it would likely have been the Capitol LP tit
EXTD=led The Songs Of Jeannie C. Riley (Capitol 177), which means that
EXTD=all of these songs would be under the copyright of Capitol, and 
EXTD=not Aubrey Mayhew. I'm not so sure EMI would throw a fit about it
EXTD=if they ever found out, and that was the case with these songs, 
EXTD=but if all of the songs on this cd are identical to those on the 
EXTD=Capitol LP, then that is first class false advertising. \n\nThe a
EXTD=lbum sounds so much better in it's original Little Darlin' vinyl 
EXTD=form, and it is worth seeking out, so check ebay for it! Jeannie 
EXTD=C. Riley - "Sock Soul" on Little Darlin' SLD-8011. To anyone who 
EXTD=owns or once owned the original "Little Darlin'" lp, if you think
EXTD=you're getting those original versions on this LP, you're only k
EXTD=idding yourself. Avoid this cd unless you are a true completist w
EXTD=ho already owns the lp and wants to hear the songs from a differe
EXTD=nt angle. But for me, who liked the original lp recordings as the
EXTD=y were, this cd just did not cut it at all when it claimed to be 
EXTD=the "Little Darlin'" sound of Jeannie C. Riley. If anything, this
EXTD=album should've been called "The Capitol Sounds Of Jeannie C. Ri
EXTD=ley".
