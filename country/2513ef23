EXTD=of the music on the box is firmly within the tradition establishe

EXTD=tonk and ballads, but within that Jones is beginning to branch ou

EXTD=Pappy may have pushed "A Good Year for the Roses" on George, he
EXTD=aring a hit when the singer didn't, but that doesn't mean he was 
EXTD=showing any more care in recording his label's lone star. He stil
EXTD=l fed Jones songs from his publishing house, not caring much abou
EXTD=t their quality, happy to re-record old songs once again and fill
EXTD=ing out a session by covering current hits. This situation was on
EXTD=ly exacerbated at the end of George's time at the label, when he 
EXTD=was burning through songs intent on ending his contract, re-recor
EXTD=ding tunes he originally did when he first started at Musicor! \n
EXTD=\nEmphasizing quantity over quality didn't much bother Daily -- i
EXTD=t gave him more product to sell or to license later to RCA -- whi
EXTD=ch is one of the primary reasons Jones was eager to leap from Mus
EXTD=icor to Epic, where he would be able to duet with his new love, T
EXTD=ammy Wynette, and record with her producer, Billy Sherrill, yet l
EXTD=istening to A Good Year for the Roses as a body of work it's poss
EXTD=ible to understand Pappy's side of things. At his worst, which di
EXTD=dn't arrive all that often, George was still a compelling vocalis
EXTD=t, and his Musicor recordings are uniformly enjoyable, even with 
EXTD=subpar performances and slapdash productions. Pappy could package
EXTD=this stuff and sell it to satisfied customers because it was alw
EXTD=ays good and occasionally transcendent. As on Walk Through This W
EXTD=orld with Me, it can take some digging to ferret out those gems, 
EXTD=but it's a pleasurable hunt, more so than before due to that grea
EXTD=ter sonic variety, which also happens to be the very thing that i
EXTD=llustrates beyond a doubt that George Jones could achieve more ar
EXTD=tistically than he did here. At Musicor, he was treated as a hitm
EXTD=aking machine, churning out pure product without discrimination. 
EXTD=At Epic, he was treated as an artist and wound up with bolder rec
EXTD=ords that turned into bigger hits. Some have called those Sherril
EXTD=l productions overblown, but after listening to George's Musicor 
EXTD=recordings in their entirety, it's easy to see why Jones was eage
