EXTD="D.R. Hayes" (Clermont, FL. United States) \nThis is the fourth 
EXTD=offering from Poco...well if you don't want to include the live a
EXTD=lbum that came before this one you don't have to. This is without
EXTD=a doubt thier best album. It's practically a masterpiece musical
EXTD=ly. The arrangements straddle country and pop very well without l
EXTD=osing the rock and roll feel. If there had to be a flaw it would 
EXTD=be the uneven songwriting that made me feel that they were trying
EXTD=to stay in the lines as far as keeping the songs short. The long
EXTD=est song on here clocks in a 5 minutes and 32 seconds. "Hoedown" 
EXTD=is the only song that needs to be short. The rest needed a little
EXTD=filler to make the songs whole in my opinion. There's still a ch
EXTD=ockful of good songs here though. "Bad Weather" Feautures Paul Co

EXTD=cut "Hoe Down" may dismay you, but from there the 'rock' side of

EXTD=an you might expect. Cotton brings into the band not only a disti
