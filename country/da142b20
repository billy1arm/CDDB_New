EXTD=sicor Recordings, 1965-1971: Pt. 2 runs through the last half of George Jo
EXTD=nes' stint with Musicor, a period that showed a greater sonic variety than
EXTD=his preceding two and a half years with the label yet ultimately illustra
EXTD=tes that George's partnership with producer and manager Pappy Daily had re
EXTD=ached a dead end. Always eager to make a quick buck, Daily steered George 
EXTD=toward the weirdest quick cash-in he ever recorded, pushing the trippy fol
EXTD=k-rock mock-protest song "Unwanted Babies" upon Possum, its swirling minor
EXTD=key march sounding like psychedelic 1967 but like nothing else here. The 
EXTD=rest of the music on the box is firmly within the tradition established by
EXTD=the first Musicor set, meaning there's plenty of hard honky tonk and ball
EXTD=ads, but within that Jones is beginning to branch out, building upon the B
EXTD=akersfield and Roger Miller influences evident on Walk Through This World 
EXTD=with Me, but also edging toward richer, detailed productions, a sound evid
EXTD=ent on both the dense "Burn Another Honky Tonk Down" and the gorgeous, ele
EXTD=gant title track. Pappy may have pushed "A Good Year for the Roses" on Geo
EXTD=rge, hearing a hit when the singer didn't, but that doesn't mean he was sh
EXTD=owing any more care in recording his label's lone star. He still fed Jones
EXTD=songs from his publishing house, not caring much about their quality, hap
EXTD=py to re-record old songs once again and filling out a session by covering
EXTD=current hits. This situation was only exacerbated at the end of George's 
EXTD=time at the label, when he was burning through songs intent on ending his 
EXTD=contract, re-recording tunes he originally did when he first started at Mu
EXTD=sicor! \n\nEmphasizing quantity over quality didn't much bother Daily -- i
EXTD=t gave him more product to sell or to license later to RCA -- which is one
EXTD=of the primary reasons Jones was eager to leap from Musicor to Epic, wher
EXTD=e he would be able to duet with his new love, Tammy Wynette, and record wi
EXTD=th her producer, Billy Sherrill, yet listening to A Good Year for the Rose
EXTD=s as a body of work it's possible to understand Pappy's side of things. At
EXTD=his worst, which didn't arrive all that often, George was still a compell
EXTD=ing vocalist, and his Musicor recordings are uniformly enjoyable, even wit
EXTD=h subpar performances and slapdash productions. Pappy could package this s
EXTD=tuff and sell it to satisfied customers because it was always good and occ
EXTD=asionally transcendent. As on Walk Through This World with Me, it can take
EXTD=some digging to ferret out those gems, but it's a pleasurable hunt, more 
EXTD=so than before due to that greater sonic variety, which also happens to be
EXTD=the very thing that illustrates beyond a doubt that George Jones could ac
EXTD=hieve more artistically than he did here. At Musicor, he was treated as a 
EXTD=hitmaking machine, churning out pure product without discrimination. At Ep
EXTD=ic, he was treated as an artist and wound up with bolder records that turn
EXTD=ed into bigger hits. Some have called those Sherrill productions overblown
EXTD=, but after listening to George's Musicor recordings in their entirety, it
EXTD='s easy to see why Jones was eager to be over-produced: he had spent too l
EXTD=ong with no production at all.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com
EXTD=Product Description\nThese were George Jones' truly classic years. After 
EXTD=more than a decade as one of country music's top stars, newfound maturity 
EXTD=and soulfulness augmented what was already the greatest voice in country m
EXTD=usic. The six years from 1965 to 1971 that Jones spent on Musicor Records 
EXTD=were marked by personal turmoil and unprecedented success, but through it 
EXTD=all he kept minting one country standard after another. This is the second
EXTD=part of Bear Family's comprehensive two volume edition of Jones' complete
EXTD=Musicor recordings, covering all sessions from 1965 until 1971. Until now
EXTD=, the Musicor sides were randomly packaged and many were unavailable, but 
EXTD=the two Bear Family boxes (plus one CD of duets with Gene Pitney available
EXTD=elsewhere on Bear Family) will tell the complete story. It was during the
EXTD=se years that George Jones married Tammy Wynette and this set includes his
EXTD=earliest duets with Tammy... plus a rare duet with Johnny Paycheck! And t
EXTD=hen there are the original versions of such all-time George Jones standard
EXTD=s as 'When The Grass Grows Over Me' 'I ll Share My World With You', 'As Lo
EXTD=ng As I Live' and one of the greatest ever country classics, 'A Good Year 
EXTD=For The Roses'! They re all here in stunningly restored sound together wit
EXTD=h 20 previously unissued recordings. In 1971, George Jones broke acrimonio
EXTD=usly from Musicor s co-owner, Pappy Daily, who d discovered and nurtured h
EXTD=im, to join Tammy Wynette on Epic Records. The hits would continue, but Ge
EXTD=orge Jones would never sound as good again! This set includes liner notes 
EXTD=by Rich Kienzle and a complete discography by Don Roy, Kittra Moore, and R
EXTD=ichard Weize. \n\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nDue to litigation, George Jones'
EXTD=s seminal Musicor recordings have been in disarray for years. In 2009, the
EXTD=Bear Family label began to rectify this state of affairs by bringing out 
EXTD=Jones's total Musicor output in two deluxe box sets, complete with the exc
EXTD=ellent remastering and documentation that the German label is famous for. 
EXTD=The 4-CD 131-track A GOOD YEAR FOR THE ROSES is the second of these collec
EXTD=tions. On it one can hear the celebrated title track as well as "I'll Shar
EXTD=e My World With You," "When The Grass Grows Over Me," and other classic so
EXTD=ngs, including George Jones's first duets with Tammy Wynette. He would eve
EXTD=ntually follow the singer (his future wife) to Epic Records in 1971. But m
EXTD=any believe that the country icon did his greatest work for Musicor under 
EXTD=his mentor Pappy Dailey's guiding hand. The results are presented here for
EXTD=the listener to judge.\n\n\n-- RELATED INFO -----------------------------
