EXTD=is Presley. The sound, while primitive in comparison to their sub
EXTD=sequent RCA recordings is very pleasing, with bright harmonies an
EXTD=d simple, straightforward accompaniment. As soon as they got to R
EXTD=CA , their sound bloomed -- the textures of the instruments becam
EXTD=e more vivid, with the "voices" of the guitars nearly as crisp as
EXTD=those of the singers themselves. By this time, they were one of 
EXTD=country music's great mixed harmony groups, and were applying tho
EXTD=se vocal talents to bluesy numbers, as well as softer country and
EXTD=bluegrass material. "The Three Bells" was the massive hit that t
EXTD=urned the trio toward pop material in 1959. Their repertory on Di
EXTD=sc Three was broadening to include more overt folk material and p
EXTD=op standards. By the time of Disc Four, Hank Garland and John D. 
EXTD=Loudermilk were playing most of the guitar, though Atkins was sti

EXTD=ominated by a brace of inspirational tunes cut for their Little B
EXTD=rown Church Hymnal album, and also includes their cover of "They 
EXTD=Call the Wind Maria," one of Jim Ed Brown's best performances. Di
EXTD=sc Six is probably the only 1964-vintage archive to feature songs
