EXTD=(Jackson Heights, NY United States]\nAn indisputable rock classic, WAR was U2's first "big" album. It gave the band a huge international following, and effectively cleared the field of any serious competition for the post-punk throne. With its ferven

EXTD=one of the scariest but most riveting album covers of all time. The expression is very unsettling like telling of something dangerous or horrible that has or will happen if we do nothing to stop it from occurring. \n\nThe two hit songs off this albu

EXTD=t exposures to U2's music. "New Year's Day" gets my nod as the greatest song of U2's early period. This is a really powerful and sometimes scary song aobut the eeriness of a possible silence before or after a major event, either good or bad based on 
EXTD=the lyrical line "All is quiet on New Year's Day". Those distant echoing piano riffs that dominate the track are absolutely hypnotizing and give the song a very chilling and enigmatic feel that rivals the atmospherics of "The Unforgettable Fire" but

EXTD=fifth track called "Drowning Man". This is a very moving and powerful song with a very downbeat vibe and a highly protesting mood to it. I love the acoustic 12-string guitars that dominate the middle of the song. "Surrender" is a really hauntingly be
EXTD=autiful song with a mix of rock and some atmospherics that give the song a distant and remote feel to it. I completely disagree with someone saying that it's too long. It's just about perfect at its five and a half minute length. "Red Light" is a ver
EXTD=y interesting song starting with a haunting female chorus and melting into an edgy and somewhat jazz-oriented song. \n\nThe last song "40" is pretty good too but it's not a whole lot to write home about and feels more like a leftover from the "Octobe

EXTD=10, 1998\nReviewer: A music fan\n'War' is U2's third major album and it is reknowned as the album which made the band's presence known in America. In 'War' U2 has regained most of the vigor of 'Boy' (their debut record and most energetic), retained 
EXTD=the complexity of their second album, 'October' while adding thoughtfullness and rage. As a result, 'War' is U2's most pensive album to date. \nEach song on the record reminds us of the self-destructiveness of society. The first song, 'Sunday, Bloody
EXTD=Sunday' borrows its name from two Irish massacres, and it is frequently mistaken as a 'rebel' song. Yet, when one analyzes the lyrics, it delivers a plea for the end of the continuous violence in Northern Ireland, and the world. The following song, 
EXTD='Seconds' (Bono rests his voice here and The Edge takes the lead on this one.), sings of the horrors of nuclear warfare and acknowledges how quickly it could all end - literally in 'seconds'. 'New Years Day' emphasizes the grim circumstances of war a
EXTD=nd hope's rapid rate of deterioration. 'Like A Song...' contains allusions to the Irish Civil War and reflects the reluctance to participate in another conflict again. 'Drowing Man' is the tale of a dying man struggling to reunite with his love. The 
EXTD=fast-paced 'The Refugee' tells two stories of a young woman ready to leave her homeland and of a young man enthusiastic about fighting although not knowing exactly why. \n\nDespite the preceeding melancholy songs, 'Two Hearts Beat as One' talks of th
EXTD=e bewilderment of love and 'Red Light' speaks of the confused nature of a relationship. 'Surrender' sings of giving into change and the album ends on a rather optomistic note with "40" (based on Psalm 40). \n\nIn the eyes of any U2 fanatic 'War' woul

EXTD=ollection is complete without the! edition of 'War'.\n\nROLLING STONE REVIEW\nFrom the start, it was clear that U2 could create impressive music. The jagged guitar riff and thundering drone that launched "I Will Follow" and the rest of their 1981 deb
EXTD=ut album, Boy, was eloquent and visceral. It was also musically uncomplicated - these four young Dubliners had an instinctive sense for making the most out of simple shifts in dynamics and elementary voicings, and it gave their sound a rough, exhilara
EXTD=ting grandiloquence. The only problem was that once U2 caught a listener's attention, they had little to say. Boy waxed poetic on the mysteries of childhood without really illuminating any of them - October, its successor, wrapped itself in romance an
EXTD=d religion but didn't seem to understand either. Without a viewpoint that could conform to the stirring rhythms and sweeping crescendos of their music, U2 often ended up sounding dangerously glib.\n\nWith their third album, War, U2 have found just su
EXTD=ch a perspective, and with it, have generated their most fulfilling work vet. War makes for impressive listening, but more important, it deals with a difficult subject in a sensible way. That subject is the sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, or wh
EXTD=at the Irish call "the troubles." U2 are not the first group to play soldiers with this topic: Belfast's Stiff Little Fingers have dealt with the problem explicitly, the Clash somewhat more obliquely. But no one has caught the paradox between stance 
EXTD=and action so accurately.\n\n"Sunday Bloody Sunday," which opens the album, apparently addresses Bloody Sunday, a 1972 incident in which British paratroopers killed thirteen civilians in an illegal civil-rights demonstration in Londonderry. As an aco
EXTD=ustic guitar and a sizzling hi-hat build tension, vocalist Bono Vox sings. "I can't believe the news today...." The band slips into some lush, sustained chords as he wonders, "How long? How long must we sing this song?" then jumps back into a militan
EXTD=t, jagged dance beat.\n\nIt's great drama, and it lends a certain amount of credence to the song's wistful chorus, "Tonight, we can be as one. Tonight!" But Vox tips his hand when he sings the urgent disclaimer. "I won't heed the battle call It puts 
EXTD=my back up, puts my back up against the wall." What Vox and the band are saying, then, is that it's pointless to take irresponsible risks when confronting irresponsible authority -- but one must still take some sort of stance.\n\nUnlike the Clash, wh
EXTD=o wrestle with imperialist foreign policy, or the Gang of Four, who try to transfer a Marxist dialectic to the dance floor, U2 don't pretend to have the answers to the world's troubles. Instead, they devote their energies to letting us know that they
EXTD=are concerned and to creating an awareness about those problems. And not only is that refreshing, but it makes sense, because U2 understand that it's the gesture, not the message, that counts.\n\nComplementing U2's lyrical growth is a newly develope
EXTD=d dark sense of humor, which the band uses to striking effect throughout the album. "Seconds," for example, opens with a sleepy funk riff driven by a cheerful toy bass drum. It's a pleasant juxtaposition, but as the song's subject matter becomes clea
EXTD=r -- the insanity of nuclear blackmail, where, as Bono Vox puts it, "the puppets pull the strings"--you realize that this jolly noisemaker is no more an innocent plaything than is the one in Gunter Grass' The Tin Drum. Similarly, "New Year's Day" inc
EXTD=ludes the wisecrack, "So we are told, this is a golden age Gold is the reason for the wars we wage" -- a remark far wiser than it at first seems.\n\nYet War isn't all jaded ideals and sour wit, for as Bono Vox makes his pronouncements, his vocalize r
EXTD=eveals the full flower of U2's melodic abilities. In between the bitter humor of "Seconds," he breaks into joyous flights of wordless melody, his voice soaring in multitracked polyphony over the song's slippery rhythms. "Surrender" is lighter still, 
EXTD=thanks to its airy melody and the Edge's coolly sustained guitar. In fact, this song is the one instance where the music says more than lyrics ever could, because hearing Vox' blissful tenor floating over the backing vocals (courtesy of Kid Creole's 
EXTD=Coconuts) is a better definition of "Surrender" than anything in Webster's.\n\nGenerally, the album's musical strengths are largely the product of well-honed arrangements and carefully balanced dynamics. Even as the Edge spins increasingly sophistica
EXTD=ted guitar lines, he maintains the minimalist bluntness that sparked Boy. And while bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. have swung to more dance-oriented rhythms, their songs hurtle along with the sort of brusque purposefulness more fre
EXTD=quently associated with punk.\n\nU2 may not be great intellectuals, and War may sound more profound than it really is. But the songs here stand up against anything on the Clash's London Calling in terms of sheer impact, and the fact that U2 can sweep
EXTD=the listener up in the same sort of enthusiastic romanticism that fuels the band's grand gestures is an impressive feat. For once, not having all the answers seems a bonus. (RS 392 - Jan 22, 1997]\nJ.D. CONSIDINE
