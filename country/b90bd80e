EXTD=ctober 18, 1994\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: While Tanya Tucker is the s
EXTD=ubject of this four-CD retrospective, she should have her own com
EXTD=plete Bear Family box. No woman has done more for the modern trad
EXTD=ition in both its excellence and its excess than Tucker. There ar
EXTD=e few, with the exceptions of Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Do
EXTD=lly Parton, who can be credited with being a true singing "stylis
EXTD=t." She embodies the true meaning of the term "country diva." The
EXTD=box compiled by Tucker and longtime producer Jerry Crutchfield b
EXTD=egins with songs like her 1972 smash hit of Larry Collins' "Delta
EXTD=Dawn," originally recorded when she was still 13, and her follow
EXTD=up singles "The Jamestown Ferry," "What's Your Mama's Name Child
EXTD=," Curly Putman's "Blood Red and Going Down," and the song that b
EXTD=rought David Allan Coe to the attention of the country music esta
EXTD=blishment, "Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)." But the
EXTD=re's a catch -- these are not the originals, but rather newly rec
EXTD=orded versions made by Capitol for Greatest Hits Encore, an entir
EXTD=e collection of these tracks. The rest of the set is comprised of
EXTD=Tucker's recordings for Capitol. There are 58 tracks of pure rec
EXTD=kless, restless country soul. Here in that unmistakably throaty v
EXTD=oice are "Strong Enough to Bend," "As Long as There's a Heartbeat
EXTD=," "Girls Like Me," "If Your Heart Ain't Busy Tonight," "The Thun
EXTD=der Rolls," and "We Don't Have to Do This." And most of what's he
EXTD=re is very fine indeed, including the unreleased tracks, of which
EXTD=there are six, because Tucker gives 100 percent each time she re
EXTD=cords. But for a performer who has accomplished as much as she ha
EXTD=s, she deserves a far more accurate representation of her career 
EXTD=than this one. Look out for Raven Records' two-fers instead.-- Th
