EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nYazoo offers up another classic collection of moun
EXTT0=tain ballads and old-timey heartbreakers from the '20s and '30s 
EXTT0=on Man of Constant Sorrow. Chestnuts like "Ommie Wise," "John Ha
EXTT0=rdy," "Darling Cora," and the title track are interspersed with 
EXTT0=lesser-known recordings from B.F. Shelton, Grayson and Whitter, Ch
EXTT0=arlie Poole, and Ernest Stoneman. The Blue Sky Boys' contributio
EXTT0=n, "In the Hills of Roane County," is a chillingly beautiful hig
EXTT0=h lonesome murder ballad highlighting Earl and Bill Bolick's fra
EXTT0=ternal harmonies, and the youthful Cousin Emmy's stark "Pretty L
EXTT0=ittle Miss Out in the Garden" is accompanied intimately by her o
EXTT0=wn gentle banjo picking. Surprisingly, the only clunkers on the 
EXTT0=album come from the usually spectacular Eck Robertson, whose sin
EXTT0=ging fiddle is unusually out of tune and he spends both of the t
EXTT0=racks competing with a female vocalist who shouts over the top o

EXTT0=es). These 20 tracks were taken directly from rare old 78s, so s
