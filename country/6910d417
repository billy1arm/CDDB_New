EXTD=Robbins' complete Western recordings, 99 songs in all from 1958 
EXTD=until 1979. As a concept, Under Western Skies is cohesive and enj
EXTD=oyable, largely because Robbins' music, regardless of the particu
EXTD=lar year in which it was recorded, is unified thematically. It's 
EXTD=also a superb showcase for Robbins' voice, one of the most versat
EXTD=ile in country and western -- he was equally adept at rock and roll, 
EXTD=traditional country, or Western ballads dating back 100 years or 
EXTD=more, but he had a way of extending the latter genre's melodic be
EXTD=auty and lyricism without ever seeming repetitive. Thus, it wasn'
EXTD=t just that Robbins was covering this repertory, but that he was 
EXTD=doing it in ways that, as a solo artist of his era, were just abo

EXTD=Family vinyl release. By the mid-'60s, Robbins' voice was even be
EXTD=tter, richer and more confident on this material, and Disc Three 
EXTD=reflects this. Disc Four extends up through 1979, and it's someth

EXTD=cious little was left in the vaults for Bear Family or anyone els

EXTD=nd, Texas  \nMarty Robbins had a remarkably varied career, singin
EXTD=g everything from mainstream country to Hawaiian music with equal
EXTD=aplomb. His most engaging work, however, was with Western music.
EXTD=Whether writing his own material or interpreting traditional fav
EXTD=orites and contemporary classics, Marty was clearly at home on th
