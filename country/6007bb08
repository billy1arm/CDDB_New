EXTD=Originally Released 1980\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This is the album 
EXTD=that introduced Alabama as one of the biggest hitmaking country/p
EXTD=op bands of the '80s. While the disc contains what was termed "co
EXTD=untry-rock" at the time, this is nothing like Lynyrd Skynyrd or e
EXTD=ven Hank Williams, Jr. at his rowdiest. The closest thing to coun
EXTD=try-rock among these ten tracks is the six-minute-and-27-second t
EXTD=itle track. The earliest representation of the band's developing 
EXTD=sound includes the ballad "Why Lady Why" and the fiddle-heavy "Te
EXTD=nnessee River," both hit singles.  -- Al Campbell\n\n\nAMAZON.COM

EXTD=ostly unavailable, and fans still await the reissue of the materi
EXTD=al of those three albums: Wild Country, Deuces Wild and Alabama N
EXTD=o. 3. While those contained original recordings of several of the
EXTD=ir most famous hits, this first commercial LP sampled some of tho
EXTD=se songs and made them major hits. \n\n"I Wanna Come Over", produ
EXTD=ced on MDJ Records, became their first Top 40 country hit in 1979
EXTD=and was a major regional hit, notably in the Atlanta area. "My H
EXTD=omes In Alabama" also followed on the same label, hitting the Top
EXTD=20 the following year. While these issues were on smaller labels
EXTD=, the following two commercially produced singles "Tennessee Rive
EXTD=r" and "Why Lady Why" both were instantly #1 hits and were includ
EXTD=ed with those first two Top 40 country charting singles to comple
EXTD=te a masterpiece of an album. \n\nAlabama should not be looked at
EXTD=as a singles artist in their earliest years. The first album is 
EXTD=a masterpiece with the well-crafted ballads including "Getting Ov
EXTD=er You" and "Keep On Dreamin'", the second sung by Jeff Cook. Ala
EXTD=bama also even tested the limits with disco-charged "Get It While
EXTD=It's Hot" and created a toe tapper with "Hangin' Up My Travelin'
EXTD=Shoes". While not every song may be considered hit material, thi
EXTD=s first attempt and summary of the tough seven years that preceed

EXTD=USA]\n"My Home's In Alabama" by Alabama is one of the best debut
EXTD=albums ever from any country artist. The first track, the title 
EXTD=cut, and their first top 40 country hit, "I Wanna Come Over", wer
EXTD=e originally released on MDJ records. The latter has a full lengt
EXTD=h version on CD and it's longer than the LP version. The other si
EXTD=ngles they released went to number one in "Tennessee River" and "
EXTD=Why Lady Why." This was the start of something big for Alabama. \n

EXTD=s, September 1, 2001 \nBy  Brent H. Williams (Huntington, WV Unit
EXTD=ed States]\nI had the pleasure of actually meeting some of the gu
EXTD=ys in Alabama at the Bowery in Myrtle Beach, SC in 1979. I was no
EXTD=t a fan of country music, on the contrary, did not care for it at
EXTD=all, but was talked into going to listen to them. Now I am glad 
EXTD=that I went, because I discovered a group that was destined to ma
EXTD=ke it big. During one of their breaks, I wanted to tell them how 
EXTD=good I thought they were so I went to the table where bassist Ted
EXTD=dy Gentry was sitting. We chatted for a bit, discussed music and 
EXTD=at the time, I was drumming in a band in West Virginia. I asked t
EXTD=hem where they were headed and he told me they were negotiating a
EXTD=recording contract. Without hesitation I told Teddy that I'd giv
EXTD=e them a year and they would be the #1 band in the country. He sm
EXTD=iled, thanked me for the vote of confidence and then went to fini
EXTD=sh another set. I handed him one of my band's business cards, wis
EXTD=hed him good luck and then enjoyed the rest of their music.\nI pu
EXTD=rchased from them, a vinyl album jacketed with a white cover and 
EXTD=black pen and ink drawing entitled "Alabama Band #3" which was re
EXTD=corded in an obscure Nashville studio, and I proceeded to wear it
EXTD=out. It contained those timeless classics they grew to be famous
EXTD=for, such as "Why, Lady, Why?", "Can't Forget About You" and of 
EXTD=course "My Home's in Alabama". The guys in my band had never hear
EXTD=d of them but when they listened to the music, they knew that Ala
EXTD=bama would soon to be superstars.\nThis CD is the debut release, 
EXTD=and while a great CD in its own right, you really should hear the
EXTD=previous mentioned "#3" album, it is Alabama in their pure state
EXTD=before corporate recording companies got hold of them. One cut o
EXTD=n "#3" that is missing is a song called "Fantasy". It should have
EXTD=been included but was apparently replaced by other songs. "My Ho
EXTD=me's in Alabama" is the start to a really great collection of thi
EXTD=s fantastic band. \n\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nProducers include: 
EXTD=Larry McBride, Sonny Limbo, Alabama.
