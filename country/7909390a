EXTD=Originally Released 1982\nCD Edition Released 1988\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This is their best effort. The group hadn't quite fallen into any formulas, and as a result, they cover the stylistic gamut pretty well. The title track practically defined what
EXTD=country groups have strived to accomplish, and the group slides easily from sentiment, to social relevance, to out-and-out partying.  -- Tom Roland \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThird album is a classic, March 23, 2004\nReviewer: P D Harris "Pete

EXTD=onica and "old man of the mountain" intro is unique. As for "Close Enough to Perfect" if any man sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of "Never Be One" also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardl

EXTD=ded at Music Mill, Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nRecorded when Alabama was in its prime, MOUNTAIN MUSIC combines pop rock with country in a very distinctive, always catchy manner. Comprising a variety of tunes ranging from slick rockers to soft, lush ball
EXTD=ads, MOUNTAIN MUSIC creates a nice contrast and engages the listener from the very first note to the last. Some of the guitar rock tunes include a meritorious version of John Fogerty's "Green River," and Alabama's own "Never Be One."\n\nHowever, the 
EXTD=most poignant songs on MOUNTAIN MUSIC are the slow dances. Songs such as "You Turn Me On," and "Close Enough To Be Perfect" are strong country ballads perfect for cuddling up with a loved one. While the production on this album is very much of its ti

EXTD=labama. All of these outfits are more adept at country than rock, and of the three, Alabama is currently the most successful -- and the least interesting. While lead singer Randy Owen has a pleasant voice and the emotional directness of Merle Haggard
EXTD=, and while some of the tunes on Mountain Music feature charged electric-guitar duels, Alabama lacks the solid adherence to roots that would give their good-time songs some substance. Their most attractive numbers, such as the title song of Mountain 
EXTD=Music, sound an awful lot like TV jingles. And all too often they settle for lugubrious pop schlock ("Close Enough to Perfect," "Never Be One") that even Kenny Rogers might be too embarrassed to sing. (RS 370 - May 27, 1982)  -- DON SHEWEY
