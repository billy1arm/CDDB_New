EXTD=ERT REVIEW:  ("Skid Row Joe - Down In The Alley")   This LP is worth seeki
EXTD=ng out -- as so many of Porter Wagoner's are -- just for the cover, which 
EXTD=shows him with reverse Grecian formula in his hair, dressed in skid row cl
EXTD=othes, standing outside the old Ryman circa 1970, with an empty pint bottl
EXTD=e behind him, hat in hand, looking insane. It's funnier than hell. Like "T
EXTD=he Rubber Room" from the mid-'60s, this is a theme album on the horrors, r
EXTD=easons, and solutions for drinking. As Skid Row Joe himself puts it in the
EXTD=liner notes: "Here are some thoughts and sights that go on in a wino's mi
EXTD=nd -- a man that drinks to ease the pain." There are the amazing spoken wo
EXTD=rd dialogues such as Wagoner's own "The Silent Kind," delivered in the fir
EXTD=st person, or "The Sidewalks of Chicago" written by Dave Kirby, which was 
EXTD=a minor hit for Merle Haggard in the '60s. There's also a stunning version
EXTD=of Dolly Parton's gem "The Alley" that Wagoner delivers without irony or 
EXTD=humor, but stark, blistering emotion. On the flip Wagoner does justice to 
EXTD=two more Parton songs, "One More Dime" and the closer, which is the most d
EXTD=evastating thing on the set, "When I Drink My Wine." Charlie Alridge's "Ma
EXTD=ma" restates the alleged reason for Skid Row Joe's existence -- or lack of
EXTD=- with "Mama" and the unlikely choice of Tom Paxton's "Bottle of Wine," 
EXTD=later covered by the rock band the Fireballs, and Johnny Mullin' "I Judged
EXTD=a Man" is the album's best morality play. In all Wagoner succeeds again o
EXTD=n another of his concept albums. He lends both humor and pathos to his sub
EXTD=ject and delivers all of it without a trace of irony or cynicism. This is 
EXTD=honky tonk music all right, but it may make you think twice about hanging 
EXTD=out in them so often.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description\n

EXTD=ssic honky-tonk era, Porter Wagoner drew his best material from a dark sou
EXTD=rce, as evidenced by this definitive three-disc collection of his finest w
EXTD=ork, THE COLD HARD FACTS OF LIFE. From the story song "Carroll County Acci
EXTD=dent" to the chilling murder ballad that gives this anthology its title, W
EXTD=agoner excelled at a deadpan delivery of tunes that stared mortality squar
EXTD=e in the eye. But no matter how low-down Wagoner gets on his tales of woe 
EXTD=and longing, the roadhouse-rocking feel of these tracks keeps things from 
EXTD=ever leaning too far towards the morose.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n

EXTD=elease of six best-selling concept albums that gave the late country music
EXTD=superstar Porter Wagoner a cult following (please see German review for a
EXTD=lbum titles). Features a rogue's gallery of murderers, philanderers, depre
EXTD=ssives, death-row inmates, unrepentant barflies, panhandling winos and oth
EXTD=er losers. Includes extensive notes covering these fascinating albums and 
EXTD=Wagoner's life and career. Porter Wagoner died October 26, 2007 after a br
EXTD=ief illness. Mainstream audiences best knew the lanky, rhinestone-suited s
EXTD=inger as a symbol of 'old Nashville' and a longtime member of The Grand Ol
EXTD=e Opry. But a younger audience embraced him for the dark, nightmarish conc
EXTD=ept albums he made for RCA Victor during the late sixties. With songs penn
EXTD=ed by such writers as Bill Anderson, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Willi
EXTD=e Nelson, Dolly Parton and Mel Tillis, Wagoner's mind-numbing country noir
EXTD=sagas are filled with as much despair as any low-budget grindhouse movie 
EXTD=or cheesy paperback novel. Since their original release, these albums gain
EXTD=ed a cult following among the psychotronic set, alt-country fans and the G
EXTD=oth subculture. After being out of print for more than two decades, they'r
EXTD=e available once again in glorious stereo from the original two-track mixd
