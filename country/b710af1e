EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW:  N/A\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nMR. GUITAR is a 
EXTD=monstrous, seven-CD box set that features all of Chet Atkins reco
EXTD=rded work from 1955 through 1960. Atkins remarkable guitar techni
EXTD=que is on display everywhere, and the music is charming, exciting
EXTD=, and thoroughly entertaining.  Many consider the albums included
EXTD=here (1955-60) as Chet's definitive work. He created a vast new 
EXTD=audience with "In Three Dimensions," "Stringin' Along With Chet A
EXTD=tkins," "Finger-Style Guitar," "Hi-Fi In Focus" "Chet Atkins at H
EXTD=ome", "Mister Guitar", "Teensville", "Chet Atkins Workshop", "My 
EXTD=Brother Sings", and "Hum and Strum."\n\nIndustry Reviews\nA piece
EXTD=like 'Ain't Misbehavin'' neatly illustrates what Atkins did for 
EXTD=fingerpicking: He didn't just play the melody over an alternating
EXTD=bass line, but gave the bass line real direction and then added 
EXTD=middle voicings that moved accordingly to where they needed to go

EXTD=\nYou've Got No Record Collection, January 9, 2009 \nBy  W. R. Is
EXTD=aacs "Mojimbo" (San Francisco]\n\nIn 1977, a record store guy tol
EXTD=d me, "If you don't have 'Songs In the Key of Life', you've got n
EXTD=o record collection." He was very sure! \n\nLast week I bought th
EXTD=is collection, along with some Mingus, Debussy, and early Parliam
EXTD=ent. The wrappers are still on those others. I know they are grea
EXTD=t, but this music crushed me, and I don't need anything else for 
EXTD=a while. \n\nStarting around the end of '53 or '54, fortified by 
EXTD=his first hit, "Mister Sandman", Chet Atkins' artistic power went
EXTD=ballistic. These disks show the trajectory like a movie. \n\nHe 
EXTD=had been fired from every job for ten years. But luck in '53 gave
EXTD=him a little stability: "Sandman", and an endorsement deal with 
EXTD=Gretsch guitars. He didn't just pose for Gretsch. He made lots of
EXTD=changes to the instrument, resulting in a sound as straight and 
EXTD=burnished and revolutionary as Paul Revere sterling. \n\nBy the e
EXTD=nd of '55, he had stripped all the tricks from his music. A techn
EXTD=ical virtuoso of guitar, playing slow, straight, sweet. Wild swee
EXTD=t. Country smokehouse sweet, like a fresh picked Appalachian wood
EXTD=stove blackberry pie. \n\nHearing this perfection, you might thi
EXTD=nk: ah, smooth Nashville country stuff. But country music wasn't 
EXTD=like that yet. At all! Immediately after recording these songs, C
EXTD=het Atkins was hired by RCA to produce Elvis, the Everly Brothers
EXTD=, and every country record made in Nashville, where he built the 
EXTD=first major studio. The phenomenon of Nashville sound which he cr
EXTD=eated, now obscures the memory of his original work. \n\nA nuclea
EXTD=r explosion is too bright to see. If you're looking that way, you
EXTD='re blinded. \n\nChet Atkins' interpretation of Country, Pop, and
EXTD=Rock and Roll, became orthodoxy, the sound of radio to this day.
EXTD=We are immersed in it. But to say his original music sounds ordi
EXTD=nary, is flash blind. \n\nTime to rub the glare out of our eyes, 
EXTD=come to our senses, and give this glorious original, this shockin
EXTD=g natural genius, the focus, the attention and commitment his sem
EXTD=inal work demands. Claim the legacy of a golden era. \n\n
