EXTD=oticed or cared that in reality The Instrumental Hits was actuall
EXTD=y a compilation of tracks already available on early Buck Owens &
EXTD=His Buckaroos albums (except for the band's signature song "Buck
EXTD=aroo," which is unique to this package). Regardless of the ratio 
EXTD=of new to recycled material, this collection amply highlights the
EXTD=remarkable talents of Owens and his Buckaroos. Note: This title 
EXTD=should not be confused with The Buck Owens Songbook, another all-
EXTD=instrumental album comparable to a karaoke (read: sans lead vocal
