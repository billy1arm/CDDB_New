EXTD=h and earthy collaboration between Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harr
EXTD=is may sound like it rose from an amiable weeklong studio session
EXTD=, but the 12 tracks that make up All the Road Running were actual
EXTD=ly recorded over the span of seven years. The boot-stomping "Red 
EXTD=Staggerwing" and the gentle "Donkey Town," both of which were bum
EXTD=ped from Knopfler's Sailing to Philadelphia record, give the ex-D
EXTD=ire Straits leader a chance to flex his country muscle, while the
EXTD=wistful title track spotlights the lovely Harris, whose playful 
EXTD=demeanor and guarded confidence helps keep Knopfler in check duri
EXTD=ng his sometimes excessive soloing. The two couldn't be more at o
EXTD=dds vocally, but Knopfler's laconic drawl is like an easy chair f
EXTD=or Harris' fluid pipes, and standout tracks like the 9/11-inspire
EXTD=d "This Is Goodbye," the wistful "Beachcombing," and the infectio
EXTD=us single "This Is Us" come off as effortless statements of vital
EXTD=ity from both camps.  -- James Christopher Monger\n\nAmazon.com E
EXTD=ditorial Review\nOver the last seven years, Mark Knopfler and Emm
EXTD=ylou Harris quietly recorded an album by stealing "a few precious
EXTD=hours of studio time here and there," as the ex-Dire Straits sin
EXTD=ger/guitarist puts it. Good thing they kept it largely under wrap
EXTD=s--expectations would have pushed through the clouds, especially 
EXTD=as Knopfler conjured 10 of the 12 cuts, and Harris, who writes po
EXTD=tently, but little, contributed two ("Love and Happiness," "Belle
EXTD=Starr"). Yet now that it's here, All the Roadrunning--while beau
EXTD=tiful--seems somehow underwhelming, and without a true centerpiec
EXTD=e. Anyone familiar with the artists' famous catalogues would expe
EXTD=ct the repertoire to be poetic and brooding, and that Harris's et
EXTD=hereal soprano would add light to Knopfler's dark Prozac rumbling
EXTD=s. But the surprise is that the album is too tame, never breaks o
EXTD=ut of its midtempo groove, and never takes any big chances.\n\nTh
EXTD=at said, there is much to like: The marital scrapbook romp of "Th
EXTD=is Is Us," the bluesy bickering of "Right Now," the wrenching poi
EXTD=gnancy of the 9/11-inspired ballad "If This Is Goodbye." Knopfler
EXTD=, ever the hypnotic guitarist, turns in some thrillingly droll an
EXTD=d laconic vocals, and Harris brings the spirited coltishness of h
EXTD=er early work to "Belle Starr." In the end, though, this is not s
EXTD=o much a duet album as two famously melancholy musicians singing 
EXTD=together--at times, strikingly so. --Alanna Nash \n\nAMAZON.COM C
EXTD=USTOMER REVIEW\nA near-perfect - pairing of musical talents, Janu
EXTD=ary 21, 2007\nReviewer: Jon Eric Davidson (Redmond, WA, USA]\n\nO
EXTD=n the surface, the pairing of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris se
EXTD=emed a bit peculiar. But to those familiar with the artists and t
EXTD=heir work, "All The Roadrunning" had some intriguing possibilitie
EXTD=s. Fortunately, this project exceeded expectations. \n\nIn my min
EXTD=d, Mark Knopfler is tremendously underrated, both as a guitarist 
EXTD=and as a songwriter. Outside of his days in Dire Straits (which i
EXTD=ncluded the seminal "Brothers In Arms" album), not many people kn
EXTD=ow him. His body of work in his post-Dire Straits career has been
EXTD=quite interesting and enjoyable. His sound is unmistakable, and 
EXTD=he can play everything from blues to rock to bluegrass, with a fe
EXTD=w other genres mixed in. As for Emmylou Harris, I think she has a
EXTD=lso been overlooked and maybe a little underrated in the most rec
EXTD=ent stages of her career. She possesses a remarkable voice that c
EXTD=an be both haunting and angelic (even at the same time), and can 
EXTD=effortlessly sing any type of music with just about anybody. She 
EXTD=has also crafted an interesting body of work in the past decade o
EXTD=r so that. \n\nThroughout "All The Roadrunning", this combination
EXTD=of songwriting, vocals, and musicianship all blend together to c
EXTD=reate an impeccable collection of songs. Mr. Knopfler and Ms. Har
EXTD=ris seem to have a tremendous respect for each other's talents, w
EXTD=hich comes across in the music. There isn't a sense that they are
EXTD=trying to upstage the other, nor is there the odd song that seem
EXTD=s "out of the wheelhouse" of one of the musicians. Rather, the so
EXTD=ngs play to their strong suits - nothing seems jarring or forced. 
EXTD=\n\nVocally, the pairing is nearly perfect. Mr. Knopfler prowls t
EXTD=he deep end of the vocal range, which complements Ms. Harris' hig
EXTD=her vocal range and vice versa. On other songs, it is Mr. Knopfle
EXTD=r's guitar work that complements Ms. Harris' vocals. They seamles
EXTD=sly work through a collection of songs that range from rock to bl
EXTD=uegrass to a sort of alternative, with a little bit of blues thro
EXTD=wn in for good measure. \n\nMore often than not, the tracks on a 
EXTD=disc seem to be laid out in such a way where the stronger songs a
EXTD=re early, with the marginal or weak tracks bringing up the end. O
EXTD=n "All The Roadrunning", the track list seems far more balanced - 
EXTD=in fact, it almost builds to a very strong, emotional conclusion 
EXTD=that leaves the listener wanting more. \n\nThe disc starts off wi
EXTD=th solid, if perhaps a bit unremarkably, with "Beachcomber" and "
EXTD=I Dug Up A Diamond". But soon enough, the rocker "This Is Us" - a
EXTD=favorite of mine - really gets the disc in high gear. Another fa
EXTD=vorite, "Right Now", follows a few tracks later. It continues alo
EXTD=ng with several more solid songs before a terrific 1-2 punch of t
EXTD=he title track and "If This Is Goodbye" that close out the disc. 
EXTD=These last two songs are the ones I like the most of all. "All Th
EXTD=e Roadrunning" speaks - at least in part - to a concert tour, but
EXTD=depending on how you interpret the lyrics, you can take about 3 
EXTD=or 4 other stories from the song. "If This Is Goodbye" is a beaut
EXTD=ifully poignant track which Mr. Knopfler has said was inspired by
EXTD=the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks. The attacks aren't directly refer
EXTD=red to in the song, so there is no sense that it is a cheap attem
EXTD=pt to "capitalize" on that terrible day. Instead, you have a song
EXTD=that can speak to any romance in any phase of life, and Mr. Knop
EXTD=fler's haunting guitar work in the song (eerily reminiscent of th
EXTD=e great title track of "Brothers In Arms") create an added emotio
EXTD=nal punch to the song. \n\nYou don't need to be a fan of any part
EXTD=icular genre to truly enjoy "All The Roadrunning". You should sim
EXTD=ply be a fan of - or otherwise appreciate - good music, period. M
EXTD=r. Knopfler and Ms. Harris have put together a great disc, and on
EXTD=e that hopefully enjoys a wide audience beyond that which has alr
EXTD=eady picked up on it since its release last year. I hope that per
EXTD=haps these two great musicians will collaborate again on another 
EXTD=disc - if not right away, then before their respective careers are
EXTD=over. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nI can just see this one 
EXTD=at Starbucks..., May 20, 2006\nReviewer: Jeremy Gloff (Tampa, Fl 
EXTD=United States]\nEh, I think I need to come back to this CD a few 
EXTD=years from now. I'm getting my heart strings pulled by the music 
EXTD=of Kim Carnes lately. When I heard this one, it did absolutely no
EXTD=thing for me. I don't know if it's me, or the music itself. I lov
EXTD=e almost EVERY Emmylou CD through "Red Dirt Girl". "Stumble Into 
EXTD=Grace" had it's moments but it seemed a bit laboured. The thing I
EXTD=loved most about exploring the Emmylou catalog was how she hop s
EXTD=cotched from album to album, exploring different sounds and theme
EXTD=s each time. Neither emotionally nor sonically am I moved by anyt
EXTD=hing on this set... The harmonies seem kinda predicatable... \n\n
EXTD=Well, I hope at a different time in my life I come back to this a
EXTD=lbum and realize I missed out on a masterpiece. As it stands, I w
EXTD=alked away from it feeling like it was a by-the-book excersize in
EXTD=Americana that college and public radio will love everywhere. Bu
EXTD=t, my opinion means nothing and if I come back to this and love i
EXTD=t, I'll write another review later. I have a feeling this one's a
EXTD=grower and I'm just not giving it a chance...\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CU
EXTD=STOMER REVIEW\nShe ain't wrong., May 9, 2006\nReviewer: Christoph
EXTD=er M. Barlow (St. Louis, MO United States]\nThis is a really good
EXTD=record, but it's not as good as everyone is giving it credit for
EXTD=The Amazon reviewer has got it right. The album IS too tame. It
EXTD=IS overall too midtempo. And it doesn't really have a centerpiec
EXTD=e although 'This Is Us' might be considered one. Does this album 
EXTD=take big chances? Unequivocally, no. It sure doesn't. Of course, 
EXTD=there are some really good songs such as 'Beachcombing' and 'Bell
EXTD=e Starr' to name two. Some are just fun songs like 'Red Staggerwi
EXTD=ng' but others are way too sleepy and bland to be ranking this a 
EXTD=5 star album. 'Beyond My Wildest Dreams', yes it's got the nice a
EXTD=nd pretty acoustic guitar but it also is pretty bland with a clic
EXTD=he chorus that makes your mind wander. Don't get me wrong, I'm no
EXTD=t saying the album is bad and if you read the Amazon reviewer's r
EXTD=eview, she didn't say it was bad either. I should probably get up
EXTD=wards of 50 flames for giving this four instead of five stars. If
EXTD=you played this album at a family reunion, no-one would bat an e
EXTD=ye. Now, that doesn't make it a bad album, but it does mean that 
EXTD=it's very safe and very pleasant. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIE
EXTD=W\nLaughing at the Review, May 8, 2006\nReviewer: Shelley Keats "
EXTD=Romantic era fan"\nAs soon as I saw who the official Amazon revie
EXTD=wer was, and the fact that she dissed the album, I knew I'd like 
EXTD=it. This same writer was my touchstone when with Stereo Review. I
EXTD=f she liked it, I stayed away. If she didn't, I bought it. Too fu
EXTD=nny. Some things never change. I guess a few other people agree w
EXTD=ith me.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nI dug up a diamond..., M
EXTD=ay 2, 2006\nReviewer: Brent Willian (Louisville, KY USA]\nI find 
EXTD=it hard to see how anyone could not be excited to learn that Mark
EXTD=Knopfler and Emmylou Harris were releasing a CD together. On one
EXTD=hand you have arguably one of the best guitarists and songwriter
EXTD=s of all-time. On the other is an absolutely beautiful voice that
EXTD=flows seamlessly throughout each tune. A perfect combination, ri
EXTD=ght? Judging from this CD, yes. \n\nLet me first say that I'm a h
EXTD=uge fan of all of Mark Knopfler's work, from Dire Straits, to mov
EXTD=ie soundtracks, to his solo albums. From the very beginning of th
EXTD=is CD, you know Knopfler is there. His distinct guitar playing st
EXTD=yle shows up on the first track, "Beachcombing," which happens to
EXTD=be one of the best on the CD. "I Dug Up A Diamond" sounds like i
EXTD=t came right from Knopfler's "Sailing to Philadelphia" album. "Th
EXTD=is is Us" and "Red Staggerwing" are two of the catchiest tracks. 
EXTD=They also include the usual slower songs and ballads, which are a
EXTD=ll great. "Love and Happiness" and "All the Roadrunning" are beau
EXTD=tiful, and both accentuate Emmylou's voice. "If This is Goodbye" 
EXTD=is a heartfelt and emotional ending, inspired by the events of 9/
EXTD=11: \n\n"my famous last words/could never tell the story/spinning
EXTD=unheard/in the dark of the sky/but I love you/and this is our gl
EXTD=ory/if this is goodbye" \n\nFrom start to finish, this CD is beau
EXTD=tiful. Knopfler and Emmylou are indeed a perfect duo. I dug up a 
EXTD=diamond when I bought this CD.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n

EXTD=iewer: prisrob "prisrob" (New EnglandUSA]\nAcross a dozen duets, 
EXTD=pieced together over seven years Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler
EXTD=sing these tunes with deep emotional overtones. Much of this CD 
EXTD=relates to the life of an itinerant musician, "trying to juggle f
EXTD=amily and relationships and just the wear and tear of being in th
EXTD=e world". \n\nEmmylou says of making this CD," Mark is very much 
EXTD=in control and knows what he wants, but on the other hand, he und
EXTD=erstand the mystical process that happens when you make a record 
EXTD=and that record becomes what it is. It has everything to do with 
EXTD=the people involved, but there's this other ingredient, of someth
EXTD=ing set in motion. When I heard these songs together, it was so l
EXTD=istenable, and I mean that in the most positive way, It a very ri
EXTD=ch album, musically and lyrically, yet it doesn't requires a lot 
EXTD=of work." All of these songs were written by Emmylou and Mark. \n
EXTD=\n"Beachcombing" which starts off the album is evocative of Hurri
EXTD=cane Kristina although it was written well before. It is a song a
EXTD=bout loss, personal and emotional, says Mark, "wreckage washing u
EXTD=p all along the coast." \n\n"This is Us", is selected to become t
EXTD=he single of this album. It is infectious and many will relate to
EXTD=this. \n\nA lighter touch comes to "Red Staggewring, which is a 
EXTD=Cajun-like tune where lovers compare themselves to motorcycles, c
EXTD=ars and vintage guitars. \n\nOn "Belle Star", Emmylou compares he
EXTD=rself to an old West infamous female outlaw, "Belle Star" and Mar
EXTD=k as Jesse James. This banter is reminiscent of Johnny and June C
EXTD=ash in their early albums. \n\n"Donkey Song' as a song written by
EXTD=Mark and meant for an earlier CD. They both enjoyed the freedom 
EXTD=and silliness. \n\n"Love and Happiness:" is the only "proper" son
EXTD=g that Emmylou says she has written. "You cannot always protect y
EXTD=our children and this is my homage to them". \n\n"All the Road Ru
EXTD=nning" paints the picture of the musician always on the road sing
EXTD=ing about love found and lost, missing family and friends, and li
EXTD=fe in the fast lane. \n\n"If This Is Goodbye" came out of 9/11. M
EXTD=ark Knopler talks of reading Martin Amis and Ian McEwan, both of 
EXTD=whom he found affecting," I remember the McEwan piece honing in o
EXTD=n people in the twin towers using their mobiles to make that fina
EXTD=l phone call home to say "I love you, this is goodbye. If there i
EXTD=s anything positive to take from 9/11, that expression of love is
EXTD=surely it." \n\nThe underlying emotions, the straight from life 
EXTD=sessions, the day to day existence on the road of this album, is 
EXTD=extraordinary. This Is Them: Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler \na

EXTD=corded intermittently over the course of seven years, ALL THE ROA
EXTD=DRUNNING is the collaborative project between Dire Straits guitar
EXTD=ist and vocalist Mark Knopfler and country music luminary Emmylou
EXTD=Harris. While Knopfler's bluesy slow-hand picking and minimalist
EXTD=, muttering vocals may seem an odd match for Harris's lush, full-
EXTD=throated soprano, the pairing works remarkably well.\nBetter stil
EXTD=l is the songwriting, with the breezy back-porch opener "Beachcom
EXTD=bing" and the stately 9/11-themed "If This Is Goodbye" among the 
EXTD=highlights. As always, Knopfler's fluid guitar style is engaging,
EXTD=and it adds a shadowy, atmospheric backdrop to the roots-conscio
EXTD=us proceedings. On the surface, ALL THE ROADRUNNING is a quiet an
EXTD=d unassuming record, but its subtlety and grace are part of its l

EXTD=TONE REVIEW\nAll the Roadrunning is an elegant, sometimes sleepy 
EXTD=collection of country-folk duets pairing Dire Straits' former fro
EXTD=ntman with one of Nashville's elder stateswomen. Mark Knopfler, w
EXTD=ho's been working in roots mode for a while now on his solo recor

EXTD=os slow and the arrangements light on these portraits of heartbre
EXTD=ak and small-town life, and a handful of songs -- including the r
EXTD=eggae-tinged "Rollin' On" -- meander by unremarkably. But ballads
EXTD=like the title track and the Springsteen-esque "Beyond My Wildes
EXTD=t Dreams" are world-wise and gently gorgeous. \n-- CHRISTIAN HOAR
