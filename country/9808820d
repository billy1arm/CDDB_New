EXTD=T REVIEW: This is one of the most intriguing albums of Emmylou Ha
EXTD=rris' career, and that is saying a lot. It marked the first album
EXTD=where she wrote or co-wrote all the songs, and the strength of t
EXTD=he songwriting makes one wonder why she had never attempted it be
EXTD=fore. One can tell that this album is truly a labor of love, as i
EXTD=t is a semi-autobiographical concept album that she also co-produ
EXTD=ced. It tells the story of a girl from a small town who gets take
EXTD=n under the wing of singer that takes her (and her angelic voice)
EXTD=out on the road. (The story mirrors her relationship with Gram P
EXTD=arsons, although it is a fictional account of the life of another
EXTD=woman.) As a concept album, it only partly holds together - one m
EXTD=ust read the liner notes to get a true feeling for the story. How
EXTD=ever, Emmylou Harris sounds particularly inspired, and the songs 
EXTD=themselves are strong both musically and lyrically. As expected, 
EXTD=she truly shines on the slower ballads such as "Diamond in My Cro
EXTD=wn" and the closer "Sweet Chariot." While not essential for casua
EXTD=l fans, it is an interesting album worth tracking down for Emmylo
EXTD=u Harris fans (the album is not easily available in the U.S.). --

EXTD=Country Music, August 1, 2003 \nReviewer: B. Borgerson "cybertroo
EXTD=th" (Ashland, OR United States) \nThis may be the most overlooked
EXTD=album in pop/country music. One reason is because it never had a
EXTD=big radio hit. But that misses the point. This is not a collecti
EXTD=on of songs - it is a stunningly cohesive work of art. You don't l
EXTD=isten to Sally Rose in bits and pieces - you sit down and listen t
EXTD=o the whole thing (preferably in a dark room by yourself) and wat
EXTD=ch it like a movie. Relax, visualize, and let the music and the s
EXTD=tory take you away. If you get to the end and you don't have shiv
EXTD=ers up and down your spine and tears forming in the corners of yo
EXTD=ur eyes, well, you weren't really paying attention.\n\nSally Rose
EXTD=is a glaring omission on all those lists of "Best 100 Albums of 
EXTD=All Time." Admittedly the sonics are slighlty sub-par for Emmy - i
EXTD=t was first generation digital and the bugs hadn't all been worke
EXTD=d out. But once you get used to the slightly thin sound, you're i
EXTD=n for an extrordinary musical and emotional experience. \n\nAmazo

EXTD=have many Emmylou Harris albums. This one is my favorite. I enjo
EXTD=y story line recordings, like Willy Nelson's "Red Headed Stranger
EXTD=" and Waylon Jenning's "Honky Tonk Heroes." As far as I know, Emm
EXTD=y Lou is the only Country Female star to tightly weave a life sto
EXTD=ry theme into one of her albums, and she does it better than the 
EXTD=outlaw boys. The song lyrics are superb, as is the performance. T
EXTD=his one will play faithfully for all moods. For Emmy Lou fans, th

EXTD=here, it's all good! California buyers beware, too many purchaser

EXTD=e, March 10, 2004\nReviewer: Christina Kelley (Los Angeles, CA) \n
EXTD=I was just here to look for the song by Emmylou that was played d
EXTD=uring the closing credits of The Sopranos last week, but while se
EXTD=arching through her catalog was surprised to discover that this C
EXTD=D, probably her best ever, is only available as an import. What a
EXTD=travesty! \nA little background...The Ballad Of Sally Rose is th
EXTD=e first "concept album" ever in Country music. Talk around the ti
EXTD=me it was released was that the songs were inspired by the romant
EXTD=ic relationship between Emmylou and Gram Parsons, but only one pe
EXTD=rson knows that really, and she's never confirmed it. \n\nThe sto
EXTD=ry that's told in the CD is of a half Indian girl named Sally Ros
EXTD=e who grows up on a reservation after her father abandons the fam
EXTD=ily. She leaves the reservation, as the opening song goes "with s
EXTD=tars in her eyes and greater expectations" and soon joins a band 
EXTD=as a guitar player. While on stage one night a huge star is in th
EXTD=e audience and falls in love with her at first sight. She joins h
EXTD=is band, they get married, but he starts cheating on her before b
EXTD=eing killed on the road in a traffic accident. Heartbroken, she c
EXTD=ontinues with the band, and is now the biggest star around with s
EXTD=ell-outs everywhere they play. But she's all bummed out without h
EXTD=im and decides to retire and buy a radio station to play nothing 
EXTD=but his music 24 hours a day. Then she dies and goes to heaven.\n
EXTD=\nGreat story, huh?\n\nBut, just wait until you hear the music! B
EXTD=ackground singers include Linda Rondstadt, Dolly Parton and Waylo
EXTD=n Jennings, and you can hear them really belt it out on some beau
EXTD=tiful vocal arrangements. There are ballads, two-steps, and rocki
EXTD=ng songs on this CD, acoustic and full band songs. It's one of th
EXTD=e best ever. I still can't believe it's an import. Get it while y
EXTD=ou still can.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nOne of Country's Gem
EXTD=s, September 19, 2003\nReviewer: "timberlandko" (NW Wisconsin USA
EXTD=) \nThis album belongs on any Emmylou fan's "Must Have" list, wha
EXTD=tever it takes to find it. A powerful, cohesive concept piece, it
EXTD=should be listened to straight through, with no distractions. "W
EXTD=oman Walk the Line" is absolutely stunning, and "Sweet Chariot" c
EXTD=an be heard again and again and again, and never grow stale. Real
EXTD=ly, this album is the progenitor of the TRIO albums, and features
EXTD=many of the same performers. Every song is Emmylou's, and while 
EXTD=some have been covered by other artists, Emmy does it best. If un
EXTD=forgetable solos, impeccable harmonies, haunting renditions, stra
EXTD=ight-to-the-point lyrics, and superb production are your thing, t
EXTD=his is your album.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nEXCELLENT ALBUM

EXTD=ed States) \nYep, I'm another who paid double price, but for a Eu

EXTD="use_soap" (South Pasadena, CA, USA) \nThis really is THE BEST E
EXTD=mmylou Harris album. Since this title is not available in the USA
EXTD=(sigh), I first listened to one of the songs from this album thr
EXTD=u "Portraits" the 3-cd box set. "Sweet Chariot" is just marvelous
EXTD=, marvelous. Then I searched the net to find samples for almost a
EXTD=ll of the songs from this album, and they're all awesome ! So I g
EXTD=ot myself the import CD from Germany. Let's hope someday there's

EXTD=ry AMBROSIA!!!!!, September 28, 1999\nReviewer: A music fan\nThis
EXTD=is not only Emmylou's best collection of songs, it is one of the
EXTD=finest collections of folk/country that has ever been made! Plea
EXTD=se re-issue it!!!! because it is impossible to find this one used
EXTD=! The people who have them are'nt letting go!!! And those of us w
EXTD=ho want it will pay double!!\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nThe m
EXTD=ost fascinating album Emmylou Harris has released., September 26,
EXTD=1999\nReviewer: A music fan\nTHE BALLAD OF SALLY ROSE is much mo
EXTD=re than just an album. For starters it is one of Emmylou Harris' 
EXTD=most fascinating collections, one you just have to hear from star
EXTD=t to finish. Each song defines a small piece of the story. The ma
EXTD=terial Emmylou Harris and Paul Kennerly wrote for the album is co
EXTD=nsistent and remarkable. Uptempo numbers like "White Line", "Bad 
EXTD=News", and "K-S-O-S" are flawlessly done and instantly enjoyable.
EXTD=Where the album leaves it's mark is on the slower, more intense 
EXTD=material. "Diamond In My Crown" is warm, touching, and uplifting.
EXTD=It is a song that mixes strenght and beauty into something every
EXTD=one should hear. "Timberline" is a graceful acoustic song, with a
EXTD=beautifully harmonized ending. "Sweet Chairot" has the most awes
EXTD=ome vocal arrangements on disc, demanding a second listen. "Women
EXTD=Walk The Line" is a power ballad with Emmylou Harris delievering
EXTD=incredible vocals. "The Sweetheart Of The Rodeo" is a well done 
EXTD=western piece. The storyline is best told through the titletrack,
EXTD="Rythym Guitar", and "Long Tall Sally Rose". The only unfortunat
EXTD=e thing about THE BALLAD OF SALLY ROSE is that it is not easily a
EXTD=vailable. If you see it, buy it, you won't regret it. MATT COKER\n

EXTD=, October 17, 1998\nReviewer: A music fan\nThis should be Emmylou
EXTD=Harris' ultimate album. She wrote it (with some help and some me
EXTD=dleys) pretty much entirely, and it holds together as a "concept"
EXTD=album better than Rick Wakeman's 'Journey...", which is saying s
EXTD=omething.\nOk, the story is PURE Nashville "my dog died". So what
EXTD=? The music is BEAUTIFUL.\n\nThe beginning (Ballad of Sally Rose)
EXTD=is a setup, both musically and plotwise, that does the album wel
EXTD=l. The change, as it were, in "Diamond in my Crown" is wonderful,
EXTD=and the ending, well, um, good for grabbing a few hankies.\n\nBu
EXTD=t the music is WONDERFUL, even if the plot is a wee bit tradition
