EXTT1=MISSISSIPPI\n\n(By Bob Dylan - 1997]\n\n\nEvery step of the way, we walk the line\nYour days are numbered, so are mine\nTime is piling up, we struggle and we scrape\nWe're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.\n\nCity's just a jungle, more games to play
EXTT1=\nTrapped in the heart of it, trying to get away\nI was raised in the country, I been working in the town\nI been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down\n\nGot nothing for you, I had nothing before\nDon't even have anything for myself anymore
EXTT1=\nSky full of fire, paint pouring down\nNothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.\n\nAll my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime\nCould never do you justice in reason or rhyme\nOnly one thing I did wrong,\nStayed in Mississippi a day too
EXTT1=long\n\nWell, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall\nSay anything you want to, I have heard it all\nI was thinking about the things that Rosie said\nI was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed\n\nWalking through the leaves falling from the
EXTT1=trees\nFeeling like a stranger, nobody sees\nSo many things that we never will undo\nI know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.\n\nSome people will offer you their hand and some won't\nLast night I knew you, tonight I don't\nI need something strong to dis
EXTT1=tract my mind\nI'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind\n\nWell, I got here following the southern star\nI crossed that river just to be where you are\nOnly one thing I did wrong\nStayed in Mississippi a day too long.\n\nWell, my ship's been spli
EXTT1=t to splinters and it's sinking fast\nI'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past\nBut my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free\nI got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me\n\nEverybody moving, if they ain't already
EXTT1=there\nEverybody got to move somewhere\nStick with me baby, stick with me anyhow,\nThings should start to get interesting right about now\n\nMy clothes are wet, tight on my skin\nNot as tight as the corner that I painted myself in\nI know the fortu
EXTT1=ne is waiting to be kind\nSo give me your hand and say you'll be mine\n\nNow the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay\nYou can always come back, but you can't come back all the way\nOnly one thing I did wrong\nStayed in Mississippi a day too long

EXTT2=generosity.\nYou been a-rollin' your eyes, you been teasin' me. \n\nStanding by God's river, my soul's beginnin' to shake,\nStanding by God's river, my soul's beginnin' to shake,\nI'm countin' on you, love, to give me a break. \n\nWell, I'm leavin'
EXTT2=in the mornin' as soon as the dark clouds lift,\nYes! I'm leavin' in the mornin' just as soon as the dark clouds lift,\nGonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift. \n\nSummer days, summer nights are gone,\nSummer days, summer

EXTT5=FLOATER (TOO MUCH TO ASK]\n\n(By Bob Dylan - 2001]\n\nDown over the window\nFrom the dazzling sunlit place\nThrough the back alleys, through the blinds,\nAnother one of them endless days. \n\nHoney bees are buzzing\nLeaves begin to stir\nI'm in love
EXTT5=with my second cousin\nI tell myself I could be happy forever with her. \n\nI keep listening for footsteps,\nBut I ain't ever hearing any.\nFrom the boat, I fish for bullheads\nI catch a lot, sometimes too many. \n\nA summer breeze is blowin',\nA s
EXTT5=quall is setting in.\nSometimes it's just plain stupid\nTo get into any kind of wind. \n\nWell, the old men around here\nSometimes they get on bad terms\nWith the younger men,\nOld, young, age don't carry weight\nIt doesn't matter in the end \n\nOne
EXTT5=of the bosses' hangers-on\nSometimes comes to call\nAt times you least expect\nTryin' to bully you, strongarm you\nInspire you with fear\nIt has the opposite effect \n\nThere's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town\nThe old one, long gone\n
EXTT5=Timber two foot, six across\nBurns with the bark still on \n\nThey say times are hard\nIf you don't believe it you can follow your nose\nIt don't bother me, times are hard everywhere\nWe'll just have to see how it goes. \n\nMy old man he's like some
EXTT5=feudal lord\nGot more lives than a cat.\nI've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once\nThings come alive or they fall flat. \n\nYou can smell the pine wood burnin'\nYou can hear the school-bell ring.\nGot to get up near the teacher, if you 
EXTT5=can\nIf you wanna learn anything. \n\nRomeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion\nIt don't give you an appearance of a youthful touch."\nJuliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off\nIf it bothers you so much."\n\nThey got out 
EXTT5=of here any way they could\nCold rain can give you the shivers\nThey went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,\nAll the rest of them rebel rivers. \n\nIf you ever try to interfere with me\nOr cross my path again,\nYou do so at the peril of 
EXTT5=your own life.\nI'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound\nI've seen enough heartache and strife. \n\nMy grandfather was a duck trapper\nHe could do it with just dragnets and ropes\nMy grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,\nI don't
EXTT5=know if they had any dreams or hopes.  \n\nI had 'em once though I suppose\nTo go along with all the ring dancing,\nChristmas Carols on all the Christmas Eves\nI left all my dreams and hopes\nBuried under tobacco leaves \n\nNot always easy kicking 
EXTT5=someone out\nGot to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task\nSometimes somebody wants you to give something up\nAnd tears or not it's too much to ask.\n\nCopyright © 2001 Special Rider Music
