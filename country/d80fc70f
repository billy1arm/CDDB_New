EXTD=s 12/10/87 the province of hardcore fans but, truthfully, they are the main audience for a release such like this in 2010, and they will be satisfied by this thoroughly assured date.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description\nWh
EXTD=at is the sound of an audience eating out of the palm of a performer s hand? Utter silence and that s what you hear while John Denver is singing or speaking during this two hour-plus concert. It s not just that John s performances (part acoustic, par
EXTD=t with a string quartet), drawn from his vast repertoire, are flawless - it s also that his manner with the audience is so humble, so engaging, that he immediately creates a hushed intimacy with the crowd, and never more so than when he tells the stor

EXTD=onio, Texas]\n\nJohn Denver always was at his best in a "live concert" setting, so this release of the concert he performed on Dec. 12, 1987, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is another fine addition to his legacy of work. Hard-core fans such as myself will lo
EXTD=ve it. But even lesser fans of the man will enjoy it. \n\nSeveral years ago, PBS released a six-song CD entitled "Live and Unreleased," which they used to solicit money during their pledge breaks. Those songs came from this show. Apparently the relea
EXTD=se was popular enough that PBS released a Vol. II a couple of years later which contained six more songs from the same show. \n\nThose releases only whetted the appetites for Denver fans who wanted the whole show. Well, here it is, thanks to Collecto
EXTD=r's Choice Music's new "Live" branch label. \n\nThe first part of the show - 14 tracks including one in which Denver talks to the audience - are acoustic. It is just Denver and his guitar. \n\nThen the first disc closes with him performing "Flying fo
EXTD=r Me," the song he wrote as a tribute to the astronauts who were killed in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in early 1986. His intro description of how he thought for a time that he would be going on that mission is most interesting. \n
EXTD=\nAs he did in other shows during that period, he elected to sing live accompanied by the "Flying for Me" track recorded in the studio for the "One World" album. In effect, it is Denver doing karaoke to his own song, something many performers often d
EXTD=o for television appearances. While he did that, he had a video play behind him that was produced from NASA's archives with their cooperation. Of course, the CD listener cannot see the video, which is really too bad. He performed the song that way wh
EXTD=en I saw him in concert late in the summer of 1986, and it was very effective. So it is really cool to have an "audio souvenir." \n\nDenver switches gears for the first seven songs of the second CD by bringing a string quartet on stage to accompany h
EXTD=im. It is another solid choice. \n\nAfter that, Denver turns into political activist. He uses a spoken rendition of Joseph Malens' "The Ambulance Down in the Valley" to lead into a spoken intro of his anti-arms race song "Let Us Begin (What Are We Ma
EXTD=king Weapons For?)." \n\nThe intro to "Let Us Begin ..." is not preaching, but an effective way of asking his audience to think about the nuclear arms race that was going on at the time between the United States and the Soviet Union. Though the Sovie
EXTD=t Union dissolved a few years after this concert, the danger of nuclear arms proliferation is still with us 10 years into the 21st century. So in that context, the presentation remains very valid. \n\nWhen Denver performed "Let Us Begin ..." in conce
EXTD=rt during this period, he sang to the studio track, but with a twist. Unlike the version on the "One World" album, he included the version containing the duet track vocal of Russian artist Alexander Gradsky and another video, both of which were very 
EXTD=effective. So on this CD, Gradsky's vocal is present, although the video is not, which is again unfortunate. But perhaps it and the "Flying for Me" video can be included on a future DVD release of Denver in concert. \n\nAfter "Let Us Begin ...", Denv
EXTD=er returns to the guitar-only format for five more songs to close the concert. Among those five songs is "Annie's Song," in which Denver sings a verse in Russian, showing even more versatility. \n\nI hope there will be many more releases of Denver "L
EXTD=ive" like this one from the vaults. In particular, it would be cool to have the full show from "Live at the Sydney Opera House," recorded in 1977. That one, which has been only excerpted so far, contrasts with "Live at Cedar Rapids" in that it was wi

EXTD=982. There are others I could mention, but that's enough for this forum. I'm greedy, and I make no apologies for it. \n\nBut to get back to the "Live at Cedar Rapids" release, it is another great addition to Denver's legacy. The sound quality is exce

EXTD=A, he was a decade past his commercial peak of the mid-70s. He'd found continued success into the early '80s, but his most recent release, 1986's One World, was both the last he'd recorded for RCA and the first album in fifteen years to miss the char
EXTD=t entirely. The album's single, "Along for the Ride ('56 T-Bird)," had only middling success on the Adult Contemporary chart, and was left out of this set. Denver had forged a non-music public role as an activist, philanthropist, humanitarian, and so
EXTD=cial critic, but always remained an in-demand live performer. By this point in his career, his non-music activities flowed seamlessly into his stage performances. \n\nThis two-hour, twenty-eight track live set touches on fan favorites, social and pol
EXTD=itical commentaries and well-selected covers. Denver's voice hasn't the youthful elasticity of his earlier years, but his investment in the songs, even those he'd been touring for fifteen years, is enthusiastic and resolute. He sings the hits at full
EXTD=length, rather than mashing them into medleys, and performs covers (Lennon and McCartney's "Mother Nature's Son" and Randy Sparks' "Toledo") that had been in his live set for nearly fifteen years. He was an endearing performer, as engaging with a stor
EXTD=y or a joke as with a song, and his invitations to the audience to sing-along are as warm as a summer campfire. \n\nDenver performs most of the songs solo with his acoustic 12-string, adding a taped background for "Flying for Me" and welcoming a stri
EXTD=ng quartet on stage for disc two. His material is drawn from throughout his career, going back as early as the title song of his debut album, Rhymes and Reason, and as current as "For You" (which was dedicated to his soon-to-be second wife) and the set
EXTD=closing "Falling Leaves (The Refugees)," which he'd record the following year. His newer material is easily woven into the set, making evident that it wasn't the quality or appeal of Denver's music that had waned, only the interest of radio and the 
EXTD=new generation of record buyers. \n\nDisc two includes Denver's statements on the arms race and world hunger and a segue into his then-current "Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For)." He reaches back to 1971 for the thoughtful "Poems, Prayers
EXTD=and Promises" and climaxes with a crowd-pleasing trio of hits. A dozen of these tracks appeared previously on a pair of PBS promotional releases [1 2], but having the entire concert start-to-finish gives fans an opportunity to relive the magic of De
EXTD=nver's stagecraft. Collectors' Choice delivers the discs in a double-digipack with a four page booklet (with liner notes by Gene Sculatti) tucked into a tight pocket beneath disc two's tray. [©2010 hyperbolium dot com] \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIE

EXTD=a little singalong action ("Back Home Again", "Today", etc.) and you have to wonder where everybody went. And if you're wondering why disc 2 begins with John chiding... "Gimme a break"... crank it up and you'll hear a few audience members reminding 
EXTD=him of his longtime "catchphrase". The only real exception to this is after "Fly Away" when someone lets out a "whooop" and a few handclaps that seem to come from right next to a microphone. Strange. I believe this show took place shortly after JD fi

EXTD=otes tucked in the slot behind disc 2 (which may contain some factual errors, as another reviewer pointed out). All this being said, the recording of John himself is fine, and some of his performances remind you just how talented a singer he was. I w
EXTD=ouldn't describe myself as a hard-core Denver fan, as some of you undoubtedly are, but I've always thought John has been incredibly underappreciated as a singer/songwriter/performer, rarely even getting airplay on "oldies" stations for any of his mas
EXTD=sive hits of the mid-to-late 70's. Not to mention his activism/humanitarianism.... I couldn't believe it when I read that his desire to take part in "We Are the World" in the 80's was denied due to his "image". Go figure. But back to this collection.
EXTD=in spite of the flaws, well worth it for even a casual fan - but if they have any more like this in the future, they should really have some sort of disclaimer, or call it "The Bootleg Series" along the lines of the Bob Dylan sets. 5 stars for the
