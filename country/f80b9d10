EXTD=Originally Released February 21, 2006\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  This
EXTD=umpteenth greatest-hits collection by Tanya Tucker is different 
EXTD=in three respects from all the others. The first is that it conta
EXTD=ins 16 tracks instead of ten or 13. Secondly, it really is a hits
EXTD=collection, arranged chronologically but also by actual chart po
EXTD=sition. Finally, it contains three Arista singles from 1982 in ad
EXTD=dition to the 13 Columbia string of hits that ended in 1975. No o
EXTD=ne can argue with the music here. It's all top-notch Nashville cl
EXTD=ass, from "Delta Dawn" through to her version of Van McCoy's "Bab
EXTD=y I'm Yours." In between are stops at David Allan Coe's "Would Yo
EXTD=u Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)" and "Greener Than the Grass 
EXTD=(We Laid On)," Bobby Braddock's "I Believe the South Is Gonna Ris
EXTD=e Again," and Curly Putman's "Old Dan Tucker's Daughter" and "Blo
EXTD=od Red and Goin' Down." This is as good as it gets for Tucker, an
EXTD=d a solid introduction to one of the hottest chart-makers country
EXTD=music had to offer in the 1970s and early '80s.  -- Thom Jurek\n
EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nExactly What I Was Looking For, A
EXTD=pril 9, 2006 \nBy  Jessica Winney (Houston, TX USA]\nI like Tanya
EXTD=Tucker, but I'm not interested in owning every one of her hit so
EXTD=ngs. I had been lookng for a CD that consists mostly of her early
EXTD=hits from the 1970's and I was thrilled to find this one at Wal-
EXTD=Mart. It contains 16 songs (this is a plus because the songs tend
EXTD=to be short), it is remastered, and, best of all, it contains my
EXTD=favorite Tanya Tucker song "Would You Lay With Me (In A Field Of
EXTD=Stone). I have found that this song is often left off of her mor
EXTD=e contemporary greatest hits compilations. There is a maturity an
EXTD=d a toughness to Tanya Tucker's early songs that makes this CD a 
EXTD=particularly rewarding listen. From the opening line "She's 41 an
EXTD=d her daddy still calls her 'baby'", we know that we are listenin
EXTD=g to a singer wise beyond her years. It is as though Tucker had a
EXTD=lready seen and done everything when she recorded these songs. I 
EXTD=recently saw a documentary on television about women in country m
EXTD=usic. In it, Brenda Lee comments that "Tanya just matured faster 
EXTD=than the rest of us." Listening to this CD, you'll hear what she 
EXTD=means. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGood single disc collect
EXTD=ion of early years, March 11, 2006 \nBy  Joe L. Benson (Portland,
EXTD=Oregon USA]\nI am usually tired of the endless reissues that the
EXTD=label cranks out but I find this to have some value. First it is
EXTD=a great sampling of her Columbia years. But even better is this 
EXTD=has three of her Arista recordings that are rare. For this reason
EXTD=alone I find this collection worth getting. Two of these songs a
EXTD=re on the very complete collection called "the upper 48 hits", bu
EXTD=t that is a bit expensive. This is a lower priced alternative. \n
EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nTanya's hits from the 70s!, April
EXTD=21, 2006 \nBy  Ingeborg (Norway, Europe]\n\nThe title is mislead
EXTD=ing as these are not her 16 BIGGEST hits, but in fact her EARLIES
EXTD=T hits (1973-1983 - some very hard to find). It has been remastere
EXTD=d, but it's not re-recorded thankfully - as it is a delight to hea
EXTD=r Tanya's young voice - already then amazing. \n\nI have to give 
EXTD=this 5 stars as Tanya is an amazing artist who was way beyond her
EXTD=time with her songs. I do believe that if she was to release her
EXTD=old songs today they would all be a hit. \n\n\nHalf.com Details 
EXTD=\nProducer: Gregg Geller (Compilation) \n\nAlbum Notes\nPersonnel
EXTD=include: Tanya Tucker (vocals).\n\nThis best-of is a convincing 
EXTD=display of Tanya Tucker's talented precociousness, as well as her
EXTD=extraordinarily mature way with a lyric--she was barely 15 when 
EXTD=she cut David Allan Coe's erotically charged "Would You Lay With 
EXTD=Me in a Field of Stone." Her vocal on "The Man That Turned My Mam
EXTD=a On" lends a saucy frisson to this prime example of 1970s Southe
EXTD=rn country funk, while in "Greener Than the Grass We Laid On," he
EXTD=r insouciant "do do do" speaks volumes about a story as old as Al
EXTD=abama dirt and as contemporary as yesterday's headlines.
