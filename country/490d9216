EXTD=94\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  If any artist cried out for a cross-lic
EXTD=ensed, multi-label retrospective, it was George Jones. When Epic/
EXTD=Legacy released the double-disc The Essential George Jones: The S
EXTD=pirit of Country in 1994, he had recorded for no less than six la
EXTD=bels -- in chronological order: Starday, Mercury, United Artists,
EXTD=Musicor, Epic, MCA (since then, he's added two more labels: Elek
EXTD=tra and BNA/RCA) -- over the course of four decades, a discograph
EXTD=ical nightmare if there ever was one. The Spirit of Country was t
EXTD=he first (and, to date, only) to attempt a serious, multi-label o
EXTD=verview of George Jones' lengthy career, and while it has a few f
EXTD=laws, it nevertheless is indeed essential as an overview of his p
EXTD=rolific work, tracing his hits from 1955's "Why Baby Why" to 1989
EXTD='s wonderful "The King Is Gone (And So Are You)." That means ther
EXTD=e's nothing from his MCA records here, but that's not a major pro
EXTD=blem, since his peak ended when he left Epic, and that entire pea
EXTD=k is chronicled here. It is not chronicled evenhandedly, though. 
EXTD=Starday and Mercury account for the first seven tracks, then UA i
EXTD=s rushed through in three cuts, before moving to five Musicor sid
EXTD=es (including "A Good Year for the Roses," previously unavailable
EXTD=on CD). This means the '50s and '60s are finished in 15 tracks, 
EXTD=with the remaining 29 songs all from his Epic work of the '70s an
EXTD=d '80s. This is a bit of an imbalance, and it's hard not to wish 
EXTD=that some of the missing songs -- whether it's "What Am I Worth" 
EXTD=or "Things Have Gone to Pieces" -- were here, but, that said, the
EXTD=re are no truly essential items missing from his pre-Epic sides. 
EXTD=As far as the Epic material is concerned, the 1982 collection Ann
EXTD=iversary may have arranged the material in a more dramatic fashio
EXTD=n, but 14 of that record's 22 songs are here, including all the r
EXTD=eally big hits, although there are enough great songs absent -- "
EXTD=Nothing Ever Hurt Me (Half as Bad as Losing You)," "What My Woman
EXTD=Can't Do," "The Battle," and "Memories of Us" -- to still make t
EXTD=hat collection necessary (much as Rhino's The Best of George Jone
EXTD=s [1955-1967] still serves a valuable need). But, this set not on
EXTD=ly has songs unavailable on other collections, it does do its job
EXTD=very well, providing the best available overview of George Jones
EXTD=' career. It might not have everything, but it has all the import
EXTD=ant sides, and there simply isn't a better way to get acquainted 
EXTD=with George Jones than this.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
