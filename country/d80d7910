EXTD=This compilation contains the Bonus Tracks from both the Best Buy CD and t
EXTD=he Wal-Mart CD.  I have also made the "hidden" track called "Skin" Un-hidd
EXTD=en by making a seperate track on this compilation.  Originally it was incl
EXTD=uded on the last track of the CD's and would start playing after a one min
EXTD=ute gap of silence.  I decided it was better to be able to access the trac
EXTD=k directly.

EXTT11=This is the introduction to the bonus tracks.  I have isolated it as it'
EXTT11=s own track as it was on both the Wal-Mart and Best Buy CD at the beginn
EXTT11=ing of either Love Another Day or Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me.  This way
EXTT11=, the songs play by themselves without an introduction.  This will be ni
EXTT11=ce for MP3 ripping.
EXTT12=This is the only Bonus track which was on the CD's purchased from Best B
EXTT12=uy.
EXTT13=This is number one of two Bonus tracks which are on the Feels Like Today
EXTT13=CD from Wal-Mart.
EXTT14=This is number two of two Bonus tracks which are on the Feels Like Today
EXTT14=CD from Wal-Mart.
EXTT15=Was a Hidden Track which was included on each and every "Feels Like Toda
EXTT15=y" CD regardless of where it was purchased.  I have isolated the track a
EXTT15=nd made it accessible directly as track 16.
