EXTD=n through the wringer with his position as one of the most visibl
EXTD=e "outlaw" country stars: he'd been busted for drugs and was addi
EXTD=cted to both cocaine and alcohol and was tired of the hype surrou
EXTD=nding Nashville's co-opting what he, Willie Nelson, and a handful
EXTD=of others started in the name of greater artistic control. I've 
EXTD=Always Been Crazy is his first "political" statement about his fe
EXTD=elings. And while it may not be as great an album as Ol' Waylon o
EXTD=r Dreaming My Dreams, it's still a fine one. With a cast of playe
EXTD=rs that includes the great Tony Joe White, Ralph Mooney, Carter R
EXTD=obertson, Reggie Young, and Bee Spears, the band assembled here s
EXTD=mokes. In addition to the title track, this set also features the
EXTD=classic "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Outta Hand."
EXTD=But even though these two cuts would have been worth the purchas
EXTD=e of the album, the rest is nothing to dismiss. There are fine co
EXTD=vers of a medley of Buddy Holly hits, a poignant, barely disguise
EXTD=d ode to old friend and rambling mate Billy Joe Shaver, the glori
EXTD=ous "A Long Time Ago," and the outlaw shuffle "As the 'Billy Worl
EXTD=d Turns." There are also fine, heartfelt covers of Merle Haggard'
EXTD=s "Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down" and Johnny Cash's "I Walk the 
EXTD=Line." The set closes with a pair of ballads, which is uncharacte
EXTD=ristic of Jennings during this period - there's "Girl I Can Tell (
EXTD=You're Trying to Work It Out)," with its folk song melody and cou
EXTD=ntry music bridge. And finally, the four-and-a-half-minute "Whist
EXTD=lers and Jugglers," a broken love song by Shel Silverstein that t
EXTD=alks of surrender and loss so poignant and sharp, it numbers amon
EXTD=g Jennings' finer performances of the late '70s. In all, I've Alw
EXTD=ays Been Crazy is a solid recording, still possessing the piss an
EXTD=d vinegar of Jennings' best work with a deeper lyrical edge on mo
EXTD=st tracks. In fact, despite its obvious origins, the Holly medley
EXTD=is the only thing that keeps the album from being as stellar as 
EXTD=the aforementioned ones. Nonetheless, this is necessary for any f
EXTD=an of outlaw country in general and Jennings in particular. As a 
EXTD=perverse side note, it inexplicably took BMG until 2004 to issue 
EXTD=this record on CD.   -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nHalf.com Details \nProduc

EXTD=1978's I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY was a major success for Waylon Jenn
EXTD=ings, the seams in his public image were beginning to show, with 
EXTD=numerous songs casting aspersions on his own fame and outlaw repu
EXTD=tation. Though Waylon had pioneered the Outlaw Country movement a
EXTD=few years earlier, and celebrated his rough-and-rowdy ways in so
EXTD=ng, the hard-living lot of a country superstar was taking a toll 
EXTD=on him, and he was beginning to detail that process in a very per
EXTD=sonal way.\n\nIt would have been difficult to get more explicit a
EXTD=bout the issue than "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got O
EXTD=ut of Hand," a sentiment reinforced by the title track's acknowle
EXTD=dgement of Jennings's out-of-control lifestyle, and by "A Long Ti
EXTD=me Ago," which sums up his troubles with everything from love to 
EXTD=drugs to the press. It's no coincidence that there's a higher per
EXTD=centage of self-penned tunes here than on many Waylon albums. If 
EXTD=it weren't for the fact that he still sounded like a master of hi
EXTD=s mode, and was still hugely popular, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY woul
EXTD=d have seemed like a eulogy for the Outlaw Country scene, but, in
EXTD=retrospect, that might be just what it is.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTO
EXTD=MER REVIEW\nBack when music was worth listening too..., January 2
EXTD=5, 2005 \nBy  DanD\n\n"Be careful of something that's just what y
EXTD=ou want it to be," Waylon sings on the opening song. A little lat
EXTD=er: "Women have been my trouble since I found out they weren't me
EXTD=n." These two quotes summarize this legendary album: perfection a
EXTD=nd suspicion, love and heartbreak. This is a mostly autobiographi
EXTD=cal album about an outlaw who made music the way he--and his fans
EXTD=-wanted it made. \n\nI'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY is pure Waylon Jenni
EXTD=ngs--there's not much I can say beyond that. He wrote or cowrote 
EXTD=most of the tunes, the highlites being the title track, "A Long T
EXTD=ime Ago" (definitely an autobiographical number, written with She
EXTD=l Silverstein), the slap-stick, Roger Miller-esque "As the 'Billy
EXTD=World Turns", and the growled "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's
EXTD=Done Got Out of Hand." But his choice of covers is impeccable. T
EXTD=ony Joe White's "Billy" is haunting and picturesque, delivered in
EXTD=a way that will entrance you. He covers several Buddy Holly hits
EXTD=in a worthy tribute to his departed comrade, and turns Cash's "I
EXTD=Walk the Line" into a mellow, bluesy ballad (it takes guts to do
EXTD=that - it takes skill to pull it off). Merle Haggard's "The Bottl
EXTD=e Let Me Down" is revamped (with original steel picker Ralph Moon
EXTD=ey sitting in). The album ends on master-songwriter Shel Silverst
EXTD=ein's "Whistlers and Jugglers." \n\nThis is a legendary album. Wa
EXTD=ylon Jennings, to this day, remains unchallenged as one of the gr
EXTD=eatest performers of all time. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY is the stor
EXTD=y of this man's life, more or less...with blasting steel, driving
EXTD=drums, and a voice that will make you forget every other singer 
EXTD=you ever heard. It don't get much better than this. Ah, heck, I'l
EXTD=l go ahead and say it--you'd have to be crazy to pass this one up

EXTD=16, 2004 \nBy  bestseller92 (Southeastern Oklahoma]\n\n"I don't 
EXTD=look the way the average cowboy singer looks," Waylon sings at th
EXTD=e start of "A Long Time Ago", and that surely was true. He didn't
EXTD=sound the way your average country singer sounded, either, and f
EXTD=or that we can all be forever grateful. In 1980, when I was 12 ye
EXTD=ars old, I ordered his "I've Always Been Crazy" album on LP. That
EXTD=album was accidentally destroyed a few years ago, but now RCA ha
EXTD=s re-issued the set on CD for the first time. I bought mine today
EXTD=, and wow, if anything it's even better than I remember. Great so
EXTD=ngwriting and singing, a couple of humorous songs, a couple balla
EXTD=ds, and most of all that great Waylon DRIVE. His cover of "Tonigh
EXTD=t the Bottle Let me Down" flies out of the speakers at about Mach
EXTD=8, and even eclipses Haggard's original, in my opinion. If you l
EXTD=ike Waylon, get this CD. I think it's the finest album he ever re
EXTD=corded. Heck, it might just be the best country album EVER record
EXTD=ed. VERY HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!
