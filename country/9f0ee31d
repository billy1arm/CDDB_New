EXTD=IEW:  By 1965, Buck Owens' star shone so brightly that even the B
EXTD=eatles -- the biggest band the world had ever known -- wanted to 
EXTD=follow in his footsteps, covering his hit single "Act Naturally" 
EXTD=on their Help! album, thereby kick-starting the golden era of cou
EXTD=ntry-rock in the late '60s. Thanks to the Beatles, many young roc
EXTD=k and rollers now turned to Buck's Bakersfield sound as their templ
EXTD=ate for what country music should be, reinvigorating rock and roll 
EXTD=by adding what they learned from country, essentially reversing t
EXTD=he equation Owens came up with at the start of the '60s, when he 
EXTD=applied everything he learned from rock and roll to create the sign
EXTD=ature sound of that decade. Buck was grounded in '50s country but
EXTD=he had his head turned by rock and roll, eventually threading in t
EXTD=he driving backbeat and electric guitars to his honky tonk backgr
EXTD=ound. This sound -- lean yet powerful as a locomotive, all fueled
EXTD=by the twin guitars and harmonies of Owens and his right-hand ma
EXTD=n, Don Rich -- became known as the Bakersfield sound, and it domi
EXTD=nated country in the '60s, ruling the charts while creating score
EXTD=s of imitators and acolytes from Merle Haggard to Gram Parsons an
EXTD=d Dwight Yoakam.\n\nThe creation of that sound has never been as 
EXTD=well documented as it is on Bear Family's 2008 set Act Naturally:
EXTD=The Buck Owens Recordings 1953-1964, which runs five discs and 1
EXTD=59 tracks. Sometimes these big Bear Family sets are heavy on unre
EXTD=leased tracks, but that's not the case here - only 16 of the 159 c
EXTD=uts are previously unreleased (with 13 of them being alternates t
EXTD=acked onto the end of the set). This set may be skimpy on unrelea
EXTD=sed music, but most of Buck's recordings have been in circulation
EXTD=on CD, as Owens licensed his LPs to Sundazed for reissue (making
EXTD=him one of the few major country artists to have almost all his 
EXTD=proper LPs appear on CD) and his pre-Capitol recordings were near
EXTD=ly all rounded up on Audium's 2001 set, Young Buck. So, the value
EXTD=of Act Naturally -- as it is with almost any Bear Family set -- 
EXTD=is context, provided both by Rich Kienzle's excellent hardcover b
EXTD=iography and the presentation of the music itself as the set syst
EXTD=ematically marches from his early recordings for Pep to his big h
EXTD=its for Capitol. What's startling about this is that those early 
EXTD=singles do reveal Buck's roots so clearly, whether it's the debt 
EXTD="The House Down the Block" has to Hank Williams or how "Down on t
EXTD=he Corner of Love" has the unmistakable midtempo gait of Buck's l
EXTD=ater "Above and Beyond," or how the rockabilly of "Hot Dog" and "
EXTD=Rhythm and Booze" -- a single released under the name Corky Jones
EXTD=- hinted at the twanging Telecasters of his prime work.\n\nAll 
EXTD=these elements were in place from the start, but it took Buck a w
EXTD=hile to get there and Act Naturally follows every one of his foot
EXTD=steps, from his time backing Bud Hobbs on his MGM sessions to the
EXTD=first flowering of his signature sound on "Under Your Spell Agai
EXTD=n" in 1960 through Don Rich's switch from fiddle to electric guit
EXTD=ar roughly a few months later. As the '60s rolled on, Owens didn'
EXTD=t expand his Bakersfield sound so much as hone it, sanding off th
EXTD=e edges and turning it into something cleanly efficient yet surpr
EXTD=isingly versatile. Whether he was singing heartbreak ballads like
EXTD="Crying Time" and skipping through neo-novelties like "I've Got 
EXTD=a Tiger by the Tail" or singing tunes by Harlan Howard and Tommy 
EXTD=Collins -- or turning in renditions of Red Simpson's "Close Up th
EXTD=e Honky Tonks" and Terry Fell's "Truck Driving Man" that provided
EXTD=the blueprint for decades of country-rock to come -- he always s
EXTD=ounded unmistakably like himself. He had a sound like no other an
EXTD=d, with his expert ear, he built a songbook -- partially original
EXTD=s, partially expertly chosen covers -- that defined what modern c
EXTD=ountry music was all about in the last 40 years of the 20th centu
EXTD=ry. His impact is of course well known, but nowhere is it easier 
EXTD=to appreciate than it is on this marvelous set. -- Stephen Thomas
