EXTD=gers and Bob Wills, his gospel records, his live albums (one of w
EXTD=hich just happened to be conceptual, too: a Dixie blues LP), and 
EXTD=the LP his Strangers recorded on their own. Such a description th
EXTD=reatens to consign Hag: Concepts as an odds 'n' ends collection, 
EXTD=suggesting that these records were mere afterthoughts, a percepti
EXTD=on that is wildly inaccurate. If anything, Same Train, Different 
EXTD=Time, A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World, Land
EXTD=of Many Churches, and I Love Dixie Blues were all crafted with m
EXTD=ore care than the albums culled from the studio sessions from thi
EXTD=s time, demonstrating an exacting level of detail that's even eas
EXTD=ier to appreciate when the records are grouped together like this
EXTD=As the albums spool out one by one -- first the tributes, then 
EXTD=the live records, and finally the Strangers instrumental records 
EXTD=- it's possible to admire each on an individual basis, but the r
EXTD=emarkable thing about this box is that it paints a bigger picture
EXTD=, particularly in how Haggard arrived at grand statements through
EXTD=small, intimate moments. Nowhere is this more true than on Land 
EXTD=of Many Churches, a wildly ambitious gospel double LP with each s
EXTD=ide recorded with a different church, emphasizing different style
EXTD=s of gospel -- a move so subtle that it takes some close listenin
EXTD=g to fathom exactly what Haggard achieved here. To a certain exte
EXTD=nt, that's true of Merle's music in general, especially during th
EXTD=e era covered by these two companion Hag box sets -- it flows so 
EXTD=naturally, it seems so unforced, that it's easy to overlook how r
EXTD=ichly intertwined the country, gospel, blues, jazz, and folk are 
EXTD=within his music -- but Haggard also had a real sense of adventur
EXTD=e, captured best on that Bob Wills tribute, which he recorded not
EXTD=long after learning how to play fiddle himself. This blend of br
EXTD=avado, respect, and restlessness gives his music an almost limitl
EXTD=ess depth, a fact that's showcased in a set of this magnitude, as
EXTD=the music keeps rolling with no dip in quality (some could call 
EXTD=the Strangers instrumentals throwaways but there is such casual v
EXTD=irtuosity to these records that they're hard to resist, especiall
EXTD=y when presented as a coda to the concepts that precede them). Be
EXTD=ar Family could have presented this music with the recordings on 
EXTD=2007's Hag, but that would have made for a lengthy, expensive 12-
EXTD=disc set that may have been too much to digest at once (let alone
EXTD=purchase), and this division helps prompt some serious reflectio
EXTD=n about Haggard's Capitol recordings. The music on Hag: Concepts 
EXTD=informs the music on Hag: The Studio Recordings: listen to Concep
EXTD=ts first, and you'll hear how these explorations of his roots set
EXTD=up his sly innovations on the studio recordings - listen to it se
EXTD=cond, and it's easier to appreciate Haggard's back story. Either 
EXTD=way, these two box sets provide listening as enduring and nourish
EXTD=ing as American popular music gets. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n

EXTD=EAT."\n\nAlbum Notes\nOver the course of six stunning discs, the 
EXTD=HAG box set, lovingly compiled by hardcore country completist lab
EXTD=el Bear Family, covers some of the most crucial years of Merle Ha
EXTD=ggard's career. From 1968 to 1976, Haggard did for country music 
EXTD=what Frank Sinatra had done for pop vocals by popularizing the co
EXTD=ncept-album phenomenon. This set includes Haggard's first-class t
EXTD=ribute albums to Bob Wills and Jimmie Rodgers, his gospel album r
EXTD=ecorded in rural Baptist churches, his New Orleans-recorded Dixie
EXTD=land album, and more. Also part of the package are three live alb
EXTD=ums (including the milestone OKIE FROM MUSKOGEE-LIVE) and a batch
EXTD=of solo instrumental recordings by Haggard's longtime band the S
EXTD=trangers. An immersive experience in the vintage Haggard catalog,
EXTD=HAG contains both classic staples of the country giant's catalog
EXTD=and enormously appealing obscurities.\n\nPortions of this page C

EXTD=ox (LP-size) with 120-page hardcover book, 168 tracks. Playing ti
EXTD=me approx. 440 mns.\nMerle Haggard was one of the first country a
EXTD=rtists to see the LP as more than one hit and some filler songs.\n
EXTD=Now Bear Family gathers together all of his 'concept' LPs for Cap
EXTD=itol 1968 -1976, plus the 'live' LPs...  plus the LPs by Merle Ha
EXTD=ggard's band, the Strangers!\nFans and critics alike view this as
EXTD=Merle Haggard's finest work.\n\n\nMerle Haggard was a groundbrea
EXTD=king artist in many ways. After his initial success, he devoted a
EXTD=lot of time and creative energy to 'concepts' that interested hi
EXTD=m, including live albums, tribute albums, gospel albums, and The 
EXTD=Strangers' instrumental albums. The third and final box set in Be
EXTD=ar Family's documentation of Merle Haggard's Capitol recordings i
EXTD=ncludes all of these 'concepts.'\n\nThis is some of the finest mu
EXTD=sic from Merle Haggard's 45 year career. Fans and critics agree o
EXTD=n that. The box includes the Jimmie Rodgers tribute double album 
EXTD=from 1968 and the Bob Wills tribute album from 1970 for which Mer
EXTD=le Haggard reunited many of Bob Wills's original Texas Playboys. 
EXTD=There are three exciting live albums, including one of the best s
EXTD=elling country albums of all time, 'Okie From Muskogee--Live In M
EXTD=uskogee, Oklahoma.' There is the ambitious 'Land Of Many Churches
EXTD=' gospel project, for which Merle Haggard recorded revival-style 
EXTD=gospel music in backwoods Baptist churches, San Quentin, a Nashvi
EXTD=lle rescue mission and a California Pentecostal church. The set a
EXTD=lso includes the complete Strangers instrumental output... all of
EXTD=the songs from their five 'solo' albums plus many unreleased sur
EXTD=prises, featuring knockout playing from Roy Nichols on guitar and
EXTD=Norm Hamlet on steel guitar.\n\nThis box set captures an artist 
EXTD=using his success to take his art in new directions. This is the 
EXTD=real Merle Haggard: traditionalist, iconoclast, but above all mus
EXTD=ician.
