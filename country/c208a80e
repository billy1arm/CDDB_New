EXTD=ew\nThis collection of the songs Steve Earle recorded before his

EXTD=historical document. In fact, there's very little here to predict
EXTD=the eye for detail that would soon emerge. Most of the 14 songs 
EXTD=here are rockabilly-like numbers that sound downright generic due
EXTD=to cliched lyrics and tepid playing. Even on songs he'd later re
