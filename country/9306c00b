EXTD=uary 9, 2007\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  1974 was a hell of a year for
EXTD=George Jones creatively, with one of his finest Epic records, Th
EXTD=e Grand Tour, being issued that year. Jones' partnership with pro
EXTD=ducer Billy Sherrill saw some of its finest fruit here. The Grand
EXTD=Tour was a watershed for Jones, boasting the title track as one 
EXTD=of the most devastating country singles ever issued that came so 
EXTD=close to crossing over it was being played on some adult pop stat
EXTD=ions along with Sinatra, Bennett, Dionne Warwick, and Herb Alpert
EXTD=Ironically, one of the co-authors of the tune was none other th
EXTD=an Jones' about-to-be-ex-wife Tammy Wynette's future husband Geor
EXTD=ge Richey. If ever there were a song that cut too close to home f
EXTD=or the singer it was this one. Sherrill worked his most creative 
EXTD=magic over it, with a string section that only revealed the size 
EXTD=of itself when he wasn't singing and filled in between the guitar
EXTD=s, piano, and pedal steel during the sung lines. Jones poured his
EXTD=heart into every syllable and its chilling quality after almost 
EXTD=30 years attests to this. But this cut was only the beginning. "P
EXTD=ass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through)" with the Jordanaires 
EXTD=is one of those haunting, mid-tempo honky tonk love songs that wo
EXTD=n't let go after the first chorus has been sung. As ballads go, "
EXTD=She'll Love the One She's With" by Hank Cochran and Grady Martin 
EXTD=is one of those jealous country waltzes where obsession and love 
EXTD=continually cross each other. Shored up by a small string orchest
EXTD=ra and a pedal steel cascading through the vocal lines, it's wren
EXTD=ching and poetic. Johnny Paycheck's classic ballad "Once You've H
EXTD=ad the Best" is done poetic and musical justice by Jones and Sher
EXTD=rill - in fact, this version blows away the author's. And in a nod
EXTD=to both Bakersfield and Jones' "Thumper" period, "The Weatherman
EXTD=" is a honky tonk stomper also partially authored by Richey and i
EXTD=t sounds as if it were written just for this session - coming in t
EXTD=he middle of a host of broken love songs, this is an optimistic, 
EXTD=even giddy tune with a Mickey Raphael harmonica solo and a Don Ri
EXTD=ch sound-alike guitar break in the middle. Ultimately, this is Jo
EXTD=nes' country, the kind of country music that is pure yet as sophi
EXTD=sticated as Sherrill wanted it to be. Chet Atkins and all of his 
EXTD=countrypolitan productions never had anything on Sherrill, and wi
EXTD=th the greatest singer in the music's history as part of the team

EXTD=sed to think of a more gloriously tragic chronicle of romance-gon

EXTD=ith his insect collection, Jones drags you by the ear through a l
EXTD=itany of domestic casualties. He plays the cuckold on "She Told M
EXTD=e So," where his acceptance of an unfaithful lover's lies extends
EXTD=to his stubborn insistence that "there's roses blooming in the A
EXTD=rctic Circle." Strangely, the album closes with the bitter "Our P

EXTD=(American Beat]\nBy Mark Rubin \n\nBy 1974, George Jones had alre
EXTD=ady had quite the volatile career -- riding high on a long string
EXTD=of top-10 hits, being reduced to living in his car outside of Ja
EXTD=sper, Texas, and hitting every conceivable point between. The '70
EXTD=s opened with mostly misses for Jones, including releases with hi
EXTD=s new and equally famous wife Tammy Wynette, a few moderate chart
EXTD=ers, and a gospel LP few remember.\n\nHis media-scrutinized marri
EXTD=age was fast unraveling, and Jones had resumed drinking, this tim

EXTD=It's amazing, then, to note that just as he was about to fall fr
EXTD=om the pinnacle of success, he made what would arguably be the fi
EXTD=nest record of his career.\n\nThe Grand Tour opens with the title
EXTD=track. That lonely solo voice, just above a sad whisper and acco
EXTD=mpanied only by a tentative few notes on a piano, is so naked and
EXTD=raw in comparison to how a country song is supposed to start, it
EXTD='s almost shocking. The whole band shuffles in soon behind, in a 
EXTD=cool and familiar way. But it's those scant opening seconds, and 
EXTD=the few times when the arrangement breaks down to that solitary v
EXTD=oice again, that even the casual listener is drawn in close by th
EXTD=e emotion Jones pours out in just a few words.\n\nWith paper-thin
EXTD=courage, he casually paints a starkly remembered still-life of a
EXTD=man on the very precipice of his own ability to deal with the da
EXTD=ily reminders of his aching heart. By the final couplet, his voic
EXTD=e soars over the sweet strings and backup singers to a final cres
EXTD=cendo of hopeless loss and complete regret. In the sort of irony 
EXTD=one only finds in real country music, this title track, chock-ful
EXTD=l of heartbreak and love gone cold, was co-written by the very ma
EXTD=n (George Ritchie) to whom Jones would soon lose his wife.\n\nThe
EXTD=re were other great numbers on the session besides the big downer
EXTD=at the front. Producer Billy Sherrill gets credit for using stri

EXTD=ohnny Paycheck's "Once You've Had The Best" charted at #3, and "P
EXTD=ass Me By (If You're Only Passing Through)" and "Borrowed Angel" 
EXTD=are minor classics that hold up quite well.\n\n"Private Life", th
EXTD=e closing track, may be a throwaway, but lyrics about a celebrity
EXTD=starved public clamoring for bad news about their heroes are jus
EXTD=t as topical now as they were then. Indeed, looking back through 
EXTD=the filter of history, it could be easy to read too much into the
EXTD=lyrical content of this album. Jones and Wynette divorced soon a
