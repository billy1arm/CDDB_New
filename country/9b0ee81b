EXTD=released album Waylon at J.D.'s is here, in addition to a number
EXTD=of other complete albums such as Folk-Country, Sings Ol' Harlan,
EXTD=and Love of the Common People. Also included are early demos, ra
EXTD=dio ads for Coca-Cola and other products, a number of previously 
EXTD=unreleased cuts, and his complete A&M recordings from the early '
EXTD=60s. Many of Waylon's individual '60s albums have been reissued d
EXTD=omestically, which means that much of the music herein can be had
EXTD=for far less than the high retail price of this box set. For har
EXTD=dcore fans and completists, though, The Journey: Destiny's Child 
EXTD=is an all-inclusive survey of Waylon's early years, and the accom

EXTD=N.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nCome along on The Journey..., February 5, 
EXTD=2000\nBy Patrick Moore (Fulton, MS]\n\n"Waylon Jennings Starts He
EXTD=re", is the theme of this box-set from Bear Family in Germany.Thr
EXTD=ough unheard demo recordings, unreleased songs, finished tracks, 
EXTD=and even a few commercials, we see the start of a historical carr
EXTD=er in modern music. Unlike other career retrospectives, this set 
EXTD=alone does not attempt to summarize Waylon's career. Nor does its
EXTD=companion set "The Journey: Six Strings Away" (BCD 16370 FK). In
EXTD=stead, we are allowed to glimpse the birth of Waylon The Performe
EXTD=r.\nAppropriately, the set begins in Norman Petty's recording stu
EXTD=dio in Clovis, NM. With Buddy Holly producing, Waylon cut three t
EXTD=racks - "Jole Blon", and two versions of "When Sin Stops". The ev
EXTD=ents of February 1959 derailed Waylon's carrer, albeit temporaril
EXTD=y. But less than two years later, Waylon was back in a recording 
EXTD=studio. Not in Clovis or Lubbock, but in Phoenix, Arizona. It wou
EXTD=ld be here that Waylon Jennings, Country Legend would be born.\n\n
EXTD=Indeed, the first two discs are made up of studio tracks and demo
EXTD=recordings from the Phoenix years. For the first time, Waylon's 
EXTD=recordings for the then-new-now-legendary A&M Records. "Just To S
EXTD=atisfy You" is presented here in two versions, the first being th
EXTD=e acoustic version that appeared on A&M in 1964, the second, an u
EXTD=nreleased version with far heavier instrumentation ala the Beatle
EXTD=s or Rolling Stones. The complete "Waylon Jennings At J.D's" albu
EXTD=m is presented in original sequence, kicking off disc 2. One song
EXTD=, "Step Aside (You're Standing In My Way)", was performed by Nanc
EXTD=y Sinatra on her 1966 album "Nancy In London". Waylon's version u
EXTD=ncannilly copies Johnny Cash's style to a T. Another song, "Livin
EXTD=g Proof", was a duet with a teenager named Mirriam Eddy--better k
EXTD=nown to the world as Jessi Colter. Colter's voice in 1964 sounds 
EXTD=much like it does today. And, Waylon asked to "Stop The World And
EXTD=Have A Coke".\n\nThe RCA years start at Disc 3. The first 8 albu
EXTD=ms Waylon made for RCA are complete here, along with bits and pie
EXTD=ces of three others. There are some sonic surprises though. "Norw
EXTD=egian Wood" is in true stereo for the first time, as is the Waylo
EXTD=n/Anita Carter duet "No One's Gonna Miss Me", a track that only a
EXTD=ppeared on LP once-in mono-on the 1980 UK compilation "Waylon Mus
EXTD=ic". The recently discovered original version of "The Chokin' Kin
EXTD=d" appears for the first time ever. Listening to it, it is clear 
EXTD=why Waylon was unhappy with the reading of the song. The song is 
EXTD=much faster than the one that was eventually released, and the ly
EXTD=rics dealing with love gone wrong are inappropriate for the melod
EXTD=y.\n\nOne gathers, after reading the discography, that RCA stockp
EXTD=iled songs, then issued them when there was new product to be rel
EXTD=eased.. It is not uncommon for a Waylon album from the late 1960'
EXTD=s to be culled from as many as five previous sessions, the Harlan
EXTD=album and "Nashville Rebel" being notable exceptions.\n\nOf cour
EXTD=se, there is some dross. The instrumental tracks for the movie "N
EXTD=ashville Rebel" are in mono (the rest of the RCA material is in t
EXTD=rue stereo), and have not held up well. Possibly the original mas
EXTD=ters no longer exist. Anyhow, like most soundtrack instrumentals,
EXTD=they don't bear repeated listening. They make disc 4 longer, not
EXTD=better.\n\nDiscs 5 and 6 are a treasure trove of first-time-on C
EXTD=D tracks. The only glitches are on Disc 5: the tape is stretched 
EXTD=or some other recording bugaboo slows the song for a split second
EXTD=at the beginning of "California Sunshine". And "Long Gone" is fa
EXTD=ded in (the version on Waylon Files Vol. 5 and the "Only The Grea
EXTD=test" LP are not). The title track, originnally issued in 1967 on
EXTD=the "Love Of The Common People" LP and reissued in 1999 by BMG s
EXTD=ubsidiary Buddha Records, has a flaw about a minute into the song
EXTD=Either the tape was wrinkled, or was spliced. But every version
EXTD=of "Destiny's Child" has this flaw. And it is here too.\n\nThe b
EXTD=ook that is packaged with the set is well done indeed. Written by
EXTD=biographer Lenny Kaye, there are rare photos and a discography t
EXTD=hat covers the set's time period. Of the photos, we find out the 
EXTD=photo used for the "Leavin' Town" LP has a gas station price sign
EXTD=airbrushed out. The "Leavin' Town" back cover photo, a cropped, 
EXTD=black and white pic, now appears in a full color, uncropped shot 
EXTD=of Waylon against a backdrop of a four-lane, sign laden Nashville
EXTD=boulevard (which one I don't know).\n\nOverall, is it worth it? 
EXTD=Absolutely. There is plenty for the hardcore fan, but plenty for 
EXTD=the new fan too. Bear Family wisely split this set into two parts
EXTD=, not merely for price reasons, but for aesthetic reasons as well
