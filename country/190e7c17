EXTD=Two original LPs from the Queen of Country Music on CD for the ve
EXTD=ry first time. Before Dolly the Pop Icon. Before Dolly the Cultur
EXTD=al Phenomenon. There was Dolly the most sublime songwriter and pe
EXTD=rformer of her generation. The evidence is right here. The Faires
EXTD=t Of Them All is the greatest Dolly Parton album you've never hea
EXTD=rd, recorded over 1968 and 1969 and never reissued in any form, i
EXTD=t is a superb recording from start to finish. From the harrowing 
EXTD=psychiatric depths of Daddy Come And Get Me and the empowering he
EXTD=ights of Just The Way I Am to the most moving narrative in the Pa
EXTD=rton canon, Down From Dover. Robert tells of forbidden love, Chas
EXTD=of passion that can never be, Dolly is at her creative peak, alw
EXTD=ays breaking new ground. Also included is the 1972 LP My Favorite
EXTD=Songwriter, Porter Wagoner a fine tribute to her mentor and comp
EXTD=anion through these years. Remastered from the original RCA Victo
EXTD=r master tapes, both albums appear for the very first time on CD 
EXTD=and are presented in a Deluxe Collector's edition with exclusive

EXTD=da]\n\nTwo of Dolly Parton's most revered albums finally comes to
EXTD=CD in this beautiful collection. \n\nAnyone who has followed Dol
EXTD=ly's career knows that RCA Records hasn't done a good job in rere
EXTD=leasing her late 1960's/early 1970's discography on CD (only a ha
EXTD=ndful of Dolly albums from that era are available on compact disc
EXTD=), so it's always a treat when old Parton albums find a home on C
EXTD=D. This set is what is known as a "two on one CD" or a "twofer" i
EXTD=n which two albums are remastered from their original master tape
EXTD=s and put together in one package. This gem has all the original 
EXTD=tracks in the same order in which they were released on the origi
EXTD=nal LP, along with rare unpublished photographs, new extensive an
EXTD=d informative liner notes, and each album has a bonus track that 
EXTD=was cut from the album's original release. \n\nFirst up is "The F
EXTD=airest of Them All", released in February, 1970, which went all t
EXTD=he way to #13 on the country album chart. A superb collection, Do
EXTD=lly's fans often refer to this as her "soap opera album" in which
EXTD=Dolly finds herself in situations of peril. Songs range from the
EXTD=opening track "Daddy Come and Get Me" where Dolly's lover throws
EXTD=her in a mental institution and she pleads with her father to re
EXTD=lease her - "I'm Doing This For Your Sake" (which would go on to b
EXTD=e the "B-side" to her 1971 "Joshua" single) has the young woman g
EXTD=iving her child up for adoption - "Chas" finds Dolly yearning for 
EXTD=her sister's husband - "Robert" is a story in which a boy is in lo
EXTD=ve with a girl not knowing she is his sister - and most notably th
EXTD=ere is "Down From Dover" where the girl is shunned by her parents
EXTD=when she becomes pregnant. The girl loses the child and it is th
EXTD=en that she realizes her boyfriend isn't coming back. That song i
EXTD=s one of Dolly's most well-known by her fan base and was written 
EXTD=when she was 18 years old. She wanted to release it as a single, 
EXTD=but RCA felt it was too controversial for the time. Instead, "Dad
EXTD=dy Come and Get Me" was released as the sole single and went to #
EXTD=40. "Down From Dover" was rereleased in 2001 on Dolly's "Little S
EXTD=parrow" CD which included an additional verse not available on th
EXTD=e original recording. \n\nAnother gem on "The Fairest of Them All
EXTD=" is "Before You Make Up Your Mind", written by Dolly's uncle Bil
EXTD=l Owens, which could have been a great country single. It has a n
EXTD=eat beat and great tempo. \n\nIt is important to note as well tha
EXTD=t this album was Dolly's first in which she wrote the bulk of the
EXTD=material - 10 out of the 11 tracks were Parton-penned. As a bonus
EXTD="Everything Is Beautiful (In It's Own Way) (not the Ray Stevens'
EXTD=version) is included here and was part of "The Fairest of Them A
EXTD=ll's" recording sessions, but cut at the last minute. It was writ
EXTD=ten by Dolly as a teenager when she was back in Tennessee. When s
EXTD=he met Porter Wagoner she sung this to him, and it was this song 
EXTD=that persuaded him to hire her as his "girl-singer" on his TV and
EXTD=road show and would ultimately bring her to RCA. "Everything Is 
EXTD=Beautiful..." was included on the "Dolly" box set that came out i
EXTD=n October, 2009. \n\nDolly has stated that out of all the 81 albu
EXTD=ms she has recorded "The Fairest of Them All" has the worst album
EXTD=cover. She wanted to look like a fairy-tale princess, but the re
EXTD=sult was not of her liking. \n\nSecondly, we have "Dolly Parton S
EXTD=ings "My Favorite Songwriter, Porter Wagoner"". Released in Novem
EXTD=ber, 1972 and charting as high as #33 on the country chart, this 
EXTD=set isn't as strong as "The Fairest of Them All", but is never-th
EXTD=e-less well-recorded with Dolly's voice having that pure mountain
EXTD=sound to it. The album is a tribute to Porter who wrote all the 
EXTD=tracks. Early in 1972 Skeeter Davis released a collection of song
EXTD=s in honour of Dolly as a songwriter, so RCA felt that Dolly shou
EXTD=ld do the same for Porter who was both her mentor and duet partne
EXTD=r. \n\nThis is the album that first contained "Lonely Comin' Down
EXTD=" (it would show up on Dolly's 1974 "Jolene" record). Other great
EXTD=s here are "Washday Blues" (a minor hit), "Comes and Goes", "He L
EXTD=eft Me Love", "The Bird That Never Flew", and "When I Sing For Hi
EXTD=m", a haunting song about a person's love for God, released as a 
EXTD=single, but never charted. The bonus track here is the "B-Side" t
EXTD=o "Washday Blues" called "Just As Good As Gone", which is Dolly-p
EXTD=enned that came to CD on the "Dolly" box set. \n\nTwo extremely r
EXTD=are albums, this collection has a place in everyone's CD collecti
EXTD=on. It is surprising too that neither album sounds dated as both 
EXTD=Bob Ferguson and Porter (who is an uncredited producer on both al
EXTD=bums) made sure that Dolly's voice carried the recordings, not th
EXTD=e instrumentation, which is explains why all of Dolly's albums fr
EXTD=om that era are now regarded by both critics and fans alike as cl
EXTD=assics and the best work of her career. \n\nThank you Omni Record
EXTD=ing from Australia for rereleasing these rare and hard-to-find Do
EXTD=lly albums. Perhaps you could rerelease Dolly's "My Blue Ridge Mo
EXTD=untain Boy" and her "Bubbling Over" albums next? Thought I'd ask!
EXTD=\n\nUPDATE! For those wondering how this CD has sold, there is s
EXTD=ome great news - during the first week of release Dolly Parton's "
EXTD=The Fairest of Them All/Sings "My Favorite Songwriter, Porter Wag
EXTD=oner"" went all the way to #1 on Amazon's Classic Country CD List
EXTD=! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nFINALLY getting Dolly's class
EXTD=ic albums!!, August 18, 2010 \nBy  Allen Chapman (STAFFORD SPRING
EXTD=S, CT USA]\n\nI don't know why many of Dolly Parton's classic 70'
EXTD=s albums have not found their way onto CD, but slowly they are fi
EXTD=nally coming out. The two collected here, "The Fairest Of Them Al
EXTD=l" and "My Favorite Songwriter, Porter Wagoner" are two of her be
EXTD=st. The first album of the two, "Fairest" could also be called "T
EXTD=he Worst Cover Of Them All", great material but hideous cover pho
EXTD=to. But album cover aside, the material is top notch. The best tr
EXTD=ack on the album is "Down From Dover", the song was never a singl
EXTD=e, but became a fan favorite. The rest of the songs are classic D
EXTD=olly story telling. \n\nThe second album, "Favorite Songwriter", 
EXTD=contains all Porter Wagoner originals. One has to wonder if Porte
EXTD=r really was her favorite songwriter or if it was just a contract
EXTD=ual thing. As with the other album on the disc, the songs from th
EXTD=is album are all strong with the best being "Lonely Coming Down" 
EXTD=and "When I Sing For Him". Whether or not Wagoner was her favorit
EXTD=e songwriter, she puts her all into the songs. \n\nAlso included 
EXTD=are two bonus tracks, the first "Everything Is Beautiful (In It's
EXTD=Own Way)" was included in last years box set. The second bonus i
EXTD=s "Just As Good As Gone" a b-side from the era. The booklet inclu
EXTD=des a detailed bio of Dolly as well as photos and album notes as 
EXTD=well as a "mini poster". \n\nThese box set is great, but many of 
EXTD=Dolly's best songs are album cuts. Hopefully we will get the rest
EXTD=of the "lost" albums before long.
