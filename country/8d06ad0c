EXTD=Originally Released April 4, 1988 \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: In 1988 
EXTD=- 25 years after Patsy Cline's untimely death at the age of 30 -
EXTD=MCA released this collection of previously unreleased Grand Ole
EXTD=Opry broadcasts, which span 1956-1962. Even if Live at the Opry 
EXTD=had been extremely disappointing, there would have been an audien
EXTD=ce for this 28-minute CD. Cline, after all, went down in history 
EXTD=as one of country's all-time greats (despite having a much too sh
EXTD=ort career), and her more obsessive fans would have welcomed the 
EXTD=arrival of this release regardless of the quality. But Live at th
EXTD=e Opry is a generally rewarding, if imperfect and brief, document
EXTD=of Cline's performances at Nashville's most prestigious venue. T
EXTD=he sound quality isn't always first-rate - at times, the sound is 
EXTD=a bit scratchy for late-'50s and early-'60s recordings. But the s
EXTD=ound is never bad -- only imperfect -- and Cline is in fine form 
EXTD=on inspired performances of hits like "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces,
EXTD=" "She's Got You," and "Walkin' After Midnight." Cline was never 
EXTD=a country purist, but to people who appreciate a broader, more ex
EXTD=pansive view of country, she was an impressive example of someone
EXTD=who truly pushed the genre's boundaries. A wide variety of influ
EXTD=ences assert themselves on Live at the Opry, including rock and rol
EXTD=l, jazz, torch singing, traditional pop, and Tin Pan Alley. Count
EXTD=ry was Cline's foundation, but that didn't prevent her from being
EXTD=affected (either directly or indirectly) by the contributions of
EXTD=Billie Holiday, Jo Stafford, and Ella Fitzgerald. Those with a c
EXTD=asual interest in Cline's legacy would be better off with a colle
EXTD=ction of her best-known studio recordings, but for the seasoned C
EXTD=line enthusiast, Live at the Opry has a lot to offer -- imperfect
EXTD=ions and all.  -- Alex Henderson\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n
EXTD=Not really a "concert" per se, tunes date from 1956-1962, July 22
EXTD=, 2005 \nBy  Greg Brady "columbusboy" (Capital City]\nThe songs h
EXTD=ere come from so-called "transcription" discs. These 16 inch disc
EXTD=s were furnished to every station with rights to broadcast "Princ
EXTD=e Albert Opry Show" aired live Saturday nights on the NBC radio n
EXTD=etwork (and whenever they were able for the stations that couldn'
EXTD=t catch a live feed and used the transcriptions instead.) The rec
EXTD=ordings themselves were recorded by Opry house engineers. The rec
EXTD=ordings here come from 1956,1957,1960,1961, and 1962. It's intere
EXTD=sting to note, as the liners point out, that at the time the firs
EXTD=t two tracks were recorded Patsy had not had a national hit, so i
EXTD=t was unusual that she was given the coveted "guest artist" slot 
EXTD=as a show of faith by the Opry. (To give you an idea, the week be
EXTD=fore it was Flatt and Scruggs, the week after Johnny Horton). In 
EXTD=January of 1960 she was made an Opry castmember, though she'd sti
EXTD=ll only had 1 chart hit ("Walkin' after Midnight") \n\nRecordings
EXTD=are dated as follows: Cuts 1 and 2 6/16/1956, cut 3 12/14/1957, 
EXTD=cut 4 4/2/1960, cut 5 4/29/1960, cuts 6 and 7 8/12/1960, cut 8 9/
EXTD=3/1960, cuts 9 and 10 7/7/1961, and cuts 11 and 12 3/23/1962. Sin
EXTD=ce these were recorded live at the Opry many of these feature int
EXTD=roductions from the Opry hosts of the time: Little Jimmy Dickens,
EXTD=Ray Price, Jim Reeves, and Hank Snow. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: \nThough h
EXTD=er earliest performances are wonderful, you can note the effect a
EXTD=solid chart hit has on an audience...witness the cheers as she p
EXTD=erforms "Walkin' after Midnight" (which had just hit #3 country a
EXTD=nd #12 pop). The yodeling tour-de-force on Hank Williams' "Lovesi
EXTD=ck Blues" is something to hear. Witness her snarl out the line "I
EXTD='ve grown so used to that man somehow" and how she holds the prol
EXTD=onged final note. Stellar. Cline turns in an impassioned performa
EXTD=nce on Carl Smith's 1955 hit "There She Goes" (with the gender ch
EXTD=anged, naturally). Some barrelhouse piano underlays "Lovin' in Va
EXTD=in". If you want to hear more spare versions of Patsy's biggest h
EXTD=its, "I Fall to Pieces","Crazy" and "She's Got You" all have more
EXTD=steel than the released versions, no six-string bass, and withou
EXTD=t the reverb on the Bradley productions. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: \nIf yo
EXTD=u're already a Patsy fan, the sound quality on this is pretty goo
EXTD=d for vinyl sources. (A little bit of surface noise and "crackle"
EXTD=may be heard here and there but it's surprisingly good.) Keep in
EXTD=mind, though, what's here is short: less than a half hour of son
EXTD=gs total. You may want to opt for a used copy. \n\n3 1/2 stars \n
