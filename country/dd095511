EXTD=G EXPERT REVIEW: Cash's first album, released on Sun in 1957, was
EXTD=a little more folkloric and traditional in bent than what he put
EXTD=on most of his singles, though not pronouncedly so. In fact, fou
EXTD=r of the tracks ("I Walk the Line," "Cry! Cry! Cry!," "So Doggone
EXTD=Lonesome," and "Folsom Prison Blues") had already been hit singl
EXTD=es. For the rest of the set, Cash drew on some older folk ("Rock 
EXTD=Island Line," "The Wreck of the Old '97"), country ("[I Heard Tha
EXTD=t] Lonesome Whistle," "Remember Me [I'm the One Who Loves You]"),
EXTD=prison ("Doin' My Time"), and spiritual ("I Was There When It Ha
EXTD=ppened") songs. Filling out the set was a good, rollicking Cash o
EXTD=riginal, "Country Boy," and a rather sassy tune by the young Jerr
EXTD=y Reed, "If the Good Lord's Willing." It's a good, solid record t
EXTD=hat's very much in the mold of his classic early Sun sound, with 
EXTD=spare accompaniment that nevertheless often approaches a rockabil
EXTD=ly-country bounce. The 2002 CD reissue on Varese Sarabande adds f
EXTD=ive bonus tracks: the fine, brisk B-sides "Hey, Porter!" and "Get
EXTD=Rhythm," as well as alternate versions of "I Was There When It H
EXTD=appened," "Folsom Prison Blues," and "I Walk the Line." The album
EXTD='s desirability's a little diminished by the presence of the mate
EXTD=rial on numerous other compilations in the CD era, though it stil
EXTD=l stands well on its own. -- Richie Unterberger\n\nAmazon.com Cus
EXTD=tomer Review\nBEWARE!, November 9, 2002 \nReviewer: A music fan f
EXTD=rom McFarland, WI USA  \nI agree with RedTunicTroll's review - I'
EXTD=ve waited a long time to see this great album re-issued on CD (he
EXTD=nce the five star rating). I would add that the remastering is ex
EXTD=cellent. However, I am very sorry to say that Varese (the re-issu
EXTD=e label) has substituted an alternate demo take of "Country Boy" 
EXTD=instead of the full band version that appears on the original alb
EXTD=um. The version of "Country Boy" on this CD has just Cash with hi
EXTD=s guitar. It's a nice version of the song, but the one on the ori
EXTD=ginal album has Perkins on guitar and Grant on bass. I know this 
EXTD=for certain because I have an original copy of this album from th
EXTD=e late 1950s - it's a very beat-up copy, but it plays well enough
EXTD=for me to say without a doubt that Varese made a mistake! \n\nAm
EXTD=azon.com Customer Review\nThe Man in Black's Debut LP, August 4, 
EXTD=2002 \nReviewer: RedTunicTroll from Earth, USA  \nGiven how many 
EXTD=times Cash's Sun catalog has been visited for CD reissues, it's t
EXTD=ruly amazing that his 1957 debut album -- and, in fact, the first
EXTD=long-player ever issued by Sun Records -- has never seen the las
EXTD=er-light of compact disc. Varese Vintage lovingly rights this wro
EXTD=ng with a superb reissue of the original twelve tracks, five bonu
EXTD=s cuts, newly penned liner notes from Bill Dahl, and the album's 
EXTD=original cover art.\n\nThough the album's hits and singles have b
EXTD=een collected on numerous CDs, many of the other tracks have appe
EXTD=ared sporadically at best, and several have only been available o
EXTD=n in Bear Family's "Man in Black 1954-1958" box set. More enticin
EXTD=gly, this reissue is the first CD that reproduces the original tr
EXTD=ack order, placing the album's trio of iconic original compositio
EXTD=n hits ("Cry! Cry! Cry!" "I Walk the Line" and "Folsom Prison Blu
EXTD=es") in the context of Cash's recordings of other's songs.\n\nCas
EXTD=h's baritone, backed by the Luther Perkins' tick-tack guitar and 
EXTD=Marshall Grant's upright acoustic bass, is equally at home fuelin
EXTD=g rhythmic train songs, such as Leadbelly's "Rock Island Line" an
EXTD=d the traditional "The Wreck of the Old '97," as going down-tempo
EXTD=for prison laments such as Hank Williams' "(I Heard That) Loneso
EXTD=me Whistle Blow)" and Jimmie Skinner's "Doin' My Time". \n\nThese
EXTD=initial sessions for Sun, spanning the 1955 recording of Cash's 
EXTD=first single, "Cry! Cry! Cry!" to the album sessions in August 19
EXTD=57, are a study in minimalism. Cash's voice is front and center, 
EXTD=and the Tennessee Two's accompaniment, unslicked by the later pro
EXTD=duction flourishes of Jack Clement, gain power from their sparene
EXTD=ss.\n\nBonus tracks include two contemporary flip-sides ("Hey, Po
EXTD=rter!" and "Get Rhythm") and three previously unissued alternate 
EXTD=versions. Of particular interest is the version of "Folsom Prison
EXTD=Blues" that was cut four months before the hit single. Cash's vo
EXTD=cal is surprisingly tentative, rendered more towards his middle r
EXTD=egister than his trademark baritone's bottom end.\n\nWith Elvis, 
EXTD=Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis providing the foundation rock '
EXTD=n' roll sound of Sun Records, one might wonder why Sam Phillips d
EXTD=ecided to employ Johnny Cash's decidedly different catalog for th
EXTD=e label's first long-player. A quick spin through this rock-solid
EXTD=debut, with album tracks that measure up to the hits, explains e
EXTD=xactly why. \n\nHalf.com Album Credits\nSam Phillips, Producer\n\n
