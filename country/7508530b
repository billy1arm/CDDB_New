EXTD=that satisfied the demands of outlaw without ever stretching the

EXTD=rticularly on the lead single "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Bas

EXTD=metimes enjoyably (including a version of Little Richard's "Lucil
EXTD=le"), sometimes not as much ("Sweet Caroline" was never suited fo
EXTD=r Waylon's style). Overall, Ol' Waylon is pretty enjoyable, but i

EXTD=give the audience what it wanted. There are enough good moments t

EXTD=xas (Back to the Basics of Love)" and the jukebox favorite "Lucil

EXTD=mber 28, 1998 \nReviewer: jtri104796@aol.com from New Orleans  \n
EXTD=\nThis is a pretty good album. As Waylon's career progressed, it 
EXTD=seemed to become more rock, and less country. This album lacks th
EXTD=e ballsy soulfulness of earlier LP's like "Honky Tonk Heroes". If
EXTD=you can get ahold of "Honky Tonk Heroes" (which I've sadly heard
EXTD=is out of print), listen to the burning passion of a tune like "
EXTD=Omaha", and not get a lump in your throat, then you're a colder m
EXTD=an than me. It's albums like that which make me put Waylon up the
EXTD=re with the great ones-- Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Gram P
EXTD=arsons. However, it is also fair to say that it is of the most in
EXTD=fluential country and western albums of alltime and has molded th
EXTD=e voice of entire generation of singer-songwriters in Nashville. 
EXTD=Indeed, much of the modern-day fluff known as "contempary country
EXTD=music" can be traced to the rock-laced LP's of Waylon Jennings i
EXTD=n the late 70's epitomized by "Ol Waylon". It's ironic that on th
EXTD=is CD Waylon gives a soaring rendition of the Neil Diamond tune "
EXTD=Sweet Caroline" because there's definitely a layer of (how shall 
EXTD=I say?) Vegas-style "cheese" permeating this album. That being sa
EXTD=id, it's still a pretty good album despite its excesses. The clas
EXTD=sic "Luchenbach" makes this CD worth the purchase even if it has 
EXTD=become a cliche. I recommend "Ol Waylon" as a good starting point
EXTD=for the music of Jennings. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nInt
