EXTD=Originally Released June 29, 2004\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Few if an
EXTD=y major country artists of the 1980s and '90s had as consistent a
EXTD=run of strong recordings as Dwight Yoakam, and this compilation 
EXTD=proves that even the material he gave away was better than what m
EXTD=ost of his peers were sending out as top-shelf product. Dwight's 
EXTD=Used Records features cuts Yoakam contributed to several tribute 
EXTD=compilations, duets that appeared on other artists' albums, and a
EXTD=few unreleased covers, and while the results aren't quite as coh
EXTD=esive as a proper album, nearly everything here would have fit th
EXTD=e bill on a "real" Dwight Yoakam album. His duets with Deana Cart
EXTD=er and Heather Myles show what a generous vocal partner he can be
EXTD=, while his turns with Ralph Stanley and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Ba
EXTD=nd add some new layers of depth to his traditionalist approach. Y
EXTD=oakam's covers of "I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide" and "Mercury Blues" a
EXTD=re sly and witty but never descend into self-parody, and he sure 
EXTD=does right by Johnny Cash and Webb Pierce as he tackles their son
EXTD=gs. The album's only real flaw would be the two back-to-back vers
EXTD=ions of John Prine's "Paradise" - both performances are worthwhile
EXTD=, but over ten minutes of the song gets to be a bit much. Baring 
EXTD=that, Dwight's Used Records is a thoroughly enjoyable collection 
EXTD=of odds and ends that congeals into some solid listening -- but h
EXTD=ow come his superb version of Merle Haggard's "Holding Things Tog
EXTD=ether" from the Tulare Dust album didn't make the cut?  -- Mark D
EXTD=eming\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nIn what could almost have b
EXTD=een the fifth disc of his box set, Yoakam pairs three previously 
EXTD=unreleased recordings with 11 collaborations, tribute-album track
EXTD=s, and other odds and sods. There are some predictably oil-and-wa
EXTD=ter mismatches in singing partners (Deana Carter on "Waiting") as
EXTD=well as material ("Loco Motion," one of the new tracks, is, uh, 
EXTD="different"). Still, there's also his way-cool revival of "Mercur
EXTD=y Blues" and a robust, beautifully arranged "Understand Your Man"
EXTD=in tribute to Johnny Cash, along with some welcome hard-country 
EXTD=like Webb Pierce's "If You Were Me (And I Were You)" and that odd
EXTD=version of "I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide," which sounds all wrong at 
EXTD=first but has a way of growing on you. --John Morthland \n\n\nAMA

EXTD=troll (Earth, USA]\nThis collection of fourteen tracks, pulled fr
EXTD=om tribute albums and guest appearances on other artists' albums,
EXTD=displays the breadth of Yoakam's work with a conciseness that hi
EXTD=s own albums never could. To be fair, Yoakam's releases have been
EXTD=purpose-built as more focused efforts, and this collection, draw
EXTD=ing from disparate sources across a full decade of recording, has
EXTD=a broader charter. It's astounding to hear in one place just how
EXTD=easily Yoakam fits into rootsy mountain bluegrass, honky-tonk co
EXTD=untry, smooth adult contemporary pop, and earthy blues-inspired c
EXTD=ountry-rock. \n\nYoakam provides the ballast for Ralph Stanley's 
EXTD=high-and-lonely on the latter's "Down Where the River Bends," and
EXTD=Stanley returns the favor by taking Yoakam's "Miner's Prayer" in
EXTD=to the hills from which it was dug. Yoakam's honky-tonk outlaw he
EXTD=roes are recognized on covers of Waylon Jennings' "Stop the World
EXTD=(And Let Me Off)," Johnny Cash's "Understand Your Man," and Webb
EXTD=Pierce's "If You Were Me (And I Were You)." The latter, featurin
EXTD=g harmonies by Gail Davies, is just one of several wonderful duet
EXTD=s that include Deana Carter's adult-contemporary "Waiting" and He
EXTD=ather Miles' Mexicali-flavored "Little Chapel." \n\nYoakam is tra
EXTD=nscendent, surrounded by the acoustic sounds of the Nitty Gritty 
EXTD=Dirt Band and tearing through "Mercury Blues" and ZZ Top's "I'm B
EXTD=ad, I'm Nationwide." Bonus tracks include previously unreleased c
EXTD=overs of Little Eva's "Loco-Motion" and two versions of John Prin
EXTD=e's "Paradise." Other artists may have similar range, but preciou
EXTD=s few have the artistic gravity to make such a compilation cohesi
EXTD=ve. This is an essential collection for fans and an interesting i
EXTD=ntroduction to Yoakam's breadth. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW
