EXTD=label's 2003 two-fer of 1977's Southern Nights and 1978's Basic isn't as thematically linked as its predecessor, which were both written and produced in large part by Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. These two records share a similar sound -- the hi

EXTD=Fool"), and two rarities from the 1975 compilation album Arkansas -- a 1967 cover of Leon Payne's "You've Still Got a Place in my Heart" and the 1969 "Arkansas," a good, if slightly dated, country-pop song that would have fit well onto any of Glen C

EXTD=September 10, 2003 \nReviewer: rickv01 from Casselberry, Florida USA  \nThis is the second of cds released by Raven Records featuring a duo of Glen's albums from the 1970s. The previous one, "Rhinestone Cowboy/Bloodline", is a must have. This one, 
EXTD=featuring the albums "Southern Nights" from 1977 and "Basic" from 1978, doesn't quite compare. The "Southern Nights" album was a little bit of a let down for me when it first came out, following the solidly great albums of "Reunion", "Rhinestsone Co
EXTD=wboy" and "Bloodline" from '74, '75, and '76 respectively. Engineering wise, it is exceptional with clear, pristine sound. The two hit singles from the album - Allen Toussaint's "Southern Nights" and Neil Diamond's "Sunflower", would give the impres
EXTD=sion it is an album of rythmic, upbeat songs. Alas it isn't. Most of songs are slow ballads, three excellent - the Beach Boys hit "God Only Knows", and the Jimmy Webb tunes - "This is Sarah's Song" and (really great) "Early Morning Song". Three othe
EXTD=rs - "Guide Me", "I'm Getting Used to the Crying" and "How High did We Go" were perhaps the blandest songs Glen ever recorded. "For Cryin' out Loud", a decent, uptempo tune, was the first song Glen recorded by Michael Smotherman, who would write/co-
EXTD=write all of the songs on the follow up album - "Basic". Lastly, "Let Go", a hit previously for the writer Brian Cadd, seems out of place on the album, though not a bad song. The second album on the cd - "Basic", holds its own, though it was probabl
EXTD=y a mistake to rely exclusively on Smotherman's songwriting, as it didn't fare near as well as "Southern Nights". "Can you fool", "I'm gonna love you", "You've got to Sing it Nice and Loud", "Let's all Sing a Song About It", "California", "Never Tel
EXTD=l You no Lies" are the best songs from the album, though I personally like them all. Two bonus tracks on the cd - "Arkansas" and "You've Still Got a Place in My Heart" are good, but obscure songs he did in the Sixties and don't belong here. The othe

EXTD=duo cd. \n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nIf for no other reason, buy this album for the cover photo!!, September 12, 2003 \nReviewer: Mitch from Beaumont, TX  \nThe photo of Glen on the porch in the leisure suit is a classic, isn't it? No, seriously
EXTD=, though, "Southern Nights" continues to be my favorite Glen Campbell song, and one of my favorite songs of all time. It has a very very addictive beat and tune to it that can have you humming or singing it to yourself all day long, once it gets in 
EXTD=your head. I basically bought this album to commemorate that one song. However, there are other good songs here, namely "Sunflower" and "Early Morning Song". It is my belief that "Early Morning Song" is, without a doubt, Glen Campbell's finest song 
EXTD=that never made it onto the charts. Outstanding vocal performance that compares with his classic "By the Time I Get to Phoenix". Other good songs from the Basic album are "Can You Fool" and "Stranger in the Mirror". Overall a good pair of albums tha
