EXTD=© 2005 Capitol Records, Inc.\n\nOriginally Released September 13, 2005\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Souls Alike is the first album in Bonnie Raitt's 18-disc catalog to bear her own name as producer with some assistance from Tchad Blake. It is also the firs
EXTD=t album in her career absent a 12-bar blues. Gone are the big washes of sound that Don Was added to her Grammy-winning recordings, and the sound Raitt has chosen for herself is a bit edgier, far more adventurous than Silver Lining, her last studio of

EXTD=I Made," by Sharp and Batteau is the album's closer. With a shimmery loop and Raitt's finest vocal on the set, it's a faux jazz-ballad that is unsettling, full of bittersweet regret and the willingness to embrace the face in the mirror and the mistak

EXTD=- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nAfter almost 35 years of recording, Bonnie Raitt knows exactly who she is and what she wants, as Souls Alike, the first self-produced album of her career, attests. Though Raitt wrote none of the mate

EXTD=t Back Down" did for Tom Petty. Two songs written by pianist Jon Cleary, "Love on One Condition" and "Unnecessary Mercenary," reflect the Little Feat-in-New Orleans side to Raitt's music, while the reggae underpinnings of "God Was in the Water," the 
EXTD=electro-worldbeat of "Deep Water," and the slide-guitar funk of "Trinkets" find her settling naturally into a variety of grooves. Though she makes a sharp left turn into the sonic surrealism of "Crooked Crown," she returns to the reflective balladry 
EXTD=that has marked her musical maturity with "So Close," "I Don't Want Anything to Change," and the jazzy sophistication of the closing "The Bed I Made." While there are few surprises here, the album ranks with the most soul-satisfying of Raitt's career

EXTD=s vocals are all here. To me the biggest differences are the addition of Jon Cleary's brilliant, rollicking keys (Unnecessarily Mercenary and Love on One Condition) and the opening up of several songs into sparser, more groove oriented tracks (the op

EXTD=not to mention "Crooked Crown", a dirty groove if ever there was such a thing. This is a solid CD, and really blends several basic styles - blues, straight ahead rock, Cajun swamp music and even a little funk. I really enjoy this CD. \n\n\nAMAZON.C
EXTD=OM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nPleasant but unexceptional, November 21, 2005 \nBy  Eric J. Anderson (Ankeny, Iowa]\n\nI'm not really sure why Bonnie Raitt continues to make studio albums. Apart from the title track, I thought the last record was a dud. This one

EXTD=is fine - she has never put out a bad album - it doesn't have the kind of songs that GRAB ME that she's produced in the past. No song beats her truly soulful ballad, "Can't make you love me". Just saw her last night in concert and that song was a bu

EXTD=better albums - that shows her range and what it is like to be at her concert. I've always found her album cuts to be slicker and more tame than she is in concert. \n\nIf you've never seen her in concert....go! Her voice alone is worth the price of
