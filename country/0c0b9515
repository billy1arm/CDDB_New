EXTD=EVIEW: These 21 tracks are drawn from 1951-60 performances at the
EXTD=Grand Ole Opry, starting from a time at which Robbins was a rela
EXTD=tive unknown, and ending at a time when he was not just a country
EXTD=but a pop superstar, performing his #1 hit "El Paso" in 1960. Wh
EXTD=ile this in no way equals the best studio material he cut from th
EXTD=e period, for Robbins fans, it's a fine, well-assembled opportuni
EXTD=ty to hear him in a different context. The sound is thinner, of c
EXTD=ourse, than his Columbia recordings of the 1950s were, both in te
EXTD=rms of the actual fidelity and the more basic live arrangements. 
EXTD=It's kind of nice to hear him in a less slick setting, though, an
EXTD=d he performs well, the repertoire including familiar hits like "
EXTD=A White Sport Coat," "The Story of My Life," "Singing the Blues,"
EXTD="Knee Deep in the Blues," "I'll Go on Alone," and "The Hanging T
EXTD=ree." Of more note to specialists will be the less familiar songs
EXTD=, like his take (with fiddle) on the Arthur Crudup/Elvis Presley 
EXTD=classic "That's All Right" - two songs on his maiden 1951 Opry app
EXTD=earance ("Ain't You Ashamed" and "Good Night Cincinnati, Good Mor
EXTD=nin' Tennessee") that he never recorded in the studio - a couple o
EXTD=f gospel songs - and the Hank Williams cover "I Can't Help It (If 
EXTD=I'm Still in Love with You)." In its own way, this set illustrate
EXTD=s his considerable development over the course of the 1950s as ap
EXTD=tly as a 1950s Marty Robbins best-of would. -- Richie Unterberger
EXTD=\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nThe ink had barely dried on Mar
EXTD=ty Robbins's Columbia recording contract when the Arizona-based s
EXTD=inger debuted on the Grand Ole Opry on June 30, 1951. No matter w
EXTD=here his career took him, the Opry remained home base until his d
EXTD=eath in 1982. This collection surveys Robbins's first eight years
EXTD=on the show. On that solid, confident 1951 debut performance, "A
EXTD=in't You Ashamed" reflected his plaintive side. He tore through "
EXTD=Good Night Cincinnati, Good Mornin' Tennessee," backed by hot lea
EXTD=d guitar almost certainly from Grady Martin. The remaining select
EXTD=ions, in crystal-clear mono, reflect a bit of Robbins's gleeful e
EXTD=clecticism. He rendered the 1920s pop standard "My Isle of Golden
EXTD=Dreams" as a plaintive country tune. A stunning "I Can't Help It
EXTD=(If I'm Still in Love with You)" affirmed his mastery of Hank Wi
EXTD=lliams. Perhaps this set's greatest value is hearing contemporary
