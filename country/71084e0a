EXTD=Originally Released May 11, 1989\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Parton moved to Columbia in the late 80s and started paying more attention to her recordings, the best of which is this album. It's produced by Ricky Skaggs, who brought in such fast-picking cron

EXTD=7, 2004\nReviewer: P D Harris "Pete the music and horse racing fan" (Leicester England]\nFollowing ten years of pop-country music recorded in Hollywood, Dolly surprised everybody in 1987 when she and her friends, Linda and Emmylou, recorded the very 
EXTD=traditional country Trio album. It sold two million copies in America, far more than Dolly's solo album, Rainbow, also from 1987. The public had delivered their verdict and Dolly got the message - sing country. So, in 1989, we got this album, produce

EXTD=ly classic instantly with its catchy chorus. "Slow Healing Heart" is about as country as they come, and "What Is It My Love" explores what makes two people love each other. "Wait Till I Get You Home" joins Dolly with Mac Davis on a fun uptempo song. 
EXTD="Take Me Back To The Country" is quite symbolic, it's symbolic of Dolly returning to her country roots, but its a great song! "The Moon, The Stars and Me" is one of Dolly's best ballads, very heartbreaking, but also beautiful in its melody. Probably 
EXTD=the most interesting song here is the gospel song "He's Alive", which tells a story, and is definately the highlight of the CD. Overall fans who were upset with her crossover albums in the 80's, such as RAINBOW, REAL LOVE, etc should be satisfied wit

EXTD=p world with her 1987 release "Rainbow". Dolly, with producer Ricky Skaggs, returns to traditional country music with one of her best selling albums ever. The album produced two #1 singles "Why'd You Come In Here Lookin' Like That" and "Yellow Roses"
EXTD=Dolly kicks off the album with a bluegrass flavored cover of REO Speedwagon's "Time For Me To Fly", which is personally one of my favorite Dolly covers. The album contains two duets, one with longtime Dolly friend Mac Davis on "Wait 'Til I Get You 
EXTD=Home" and a duet with the albums producer Ricky Skaggs on "Slow Healing Heart". Dolly closes the album with one of her most requested songs "He's Alive" performed with the Christ Church Choir. This album is a must for Dolly and country fans!\n\nAMAZON.
