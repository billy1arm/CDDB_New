EXTD=d May 25, 1993\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  This is an absolutely stunning colle
EXTD=ction of essential Don Gibson material from his greatest years as both a s
EXTD=ongwriter and as a recording artist. Germany's Bear Family label has assem
EXTD=bled four discs containing a total of 122 performances with many alternate
EXTD=takes, B-sides and previously unissued recordings. Some of the folks who 
EXTD=performed with Gibson on these sides were arranger Danny Davis, the Anita 
EXTD=Kerr Singers, Floyd Cramer, the Jordanaires, Pete Drake, Chet Atkins, Roy 
EXTD=Huskey Jr., Grady Martin, Herman Wade, and many more. This is countrypolit
EXTD=an at its best. These were golden years for country music as pop, and Gibs
EXTD=on rode the charts like a lion at the beginning of the '60s brining the fo
EXTD=lksiness and writing acumen of Hank Williams and Leon Payne, the smooth vo
EXTD=calizing of Jim Reeves, and the sheer stylized image of the lonesome rambl
EXTD=er who is always glad to see a new face as he travels. Gibson's biggest tu
EXTD=nes are here, from "Sweet Dreams," and "Oh Lonesome Me," to "For a Little 
EXTD=While," to "I Can't Stop Loving You," that Ray Charles scored so big with.
EXTD=But in his own interpretations of songs by Williams, Floyd Tillman, Steph
EXTD=en Foster, youngsters Tompall Glaser and Doug Kershaw, Boudleaux Bryant an
EXTD=d Payne, the public found a singer they could identify with. No matter how
EXTD=slick the production, Gibson's voice came through as earthy. Warm and imm
EXTD=ediate. For anyone truly interested in Gibson, this set is a must. -- Thom

EXTD=t.\nThis Bear Family collection picks up where '1949-1960' leaves off, and
EXTD=although the hits were growing smaller, Don was cutting some of the most 
EXTD=strikingly original music to come out of Nashville in the early-to-mid '60
EXTD=s. Surely no one else in Nashville would have even contemplated recording 
EXTD=with Los Indios Tabajaras, much less made it work. Gospel, standards, blue

EXTD=V. A. Peek on March 13, 2008\n\nThey might have labeled Ray Charles, The 
EXTD=Genius, based on the song I Can't Stop Loving You, and the Ray Charles Cou
EXTD=ntry Album which it was on, but remember, Don Gibson wrote it with no more
EXTD=than a 2nd grade education. According to the booklet that comes with this
EXTD=box set and the other two, he came in from school one day when he was 8 y
EXTD=ears old and in the second grade, and told his mama that school was a wast
EXTD=e of time and he wasn't going back. He didn't. (I hate to tell you what wo
EXTD=uld have happened to me if I came in the house and told my mama that - in A
EXTD=NY grade. But then I was NO genius. I refused to dissect a frog in Science
EXTD=Class in High School and when the teacher said to me "If you don't dissec
EXTD=t that frog, I'll have to give you a failing grade." I said "give it to me
EXTD='cause I ain't dissecting no FROG." (I come from the same area as Andy Gr
EXTD=iffith, so if he can talk that way, so can I. He was a college professor b
EXTD=efore he was an actor.) If my science teacher had been my Language teacher
EXTD=, no doubt that he would have given me a failing grade in that as well. So
EXTD=, proof that I'm no genius. It also was obvious at that stage that I would
EXTD=not become a brain surgeon. I became something better. The wife (52 years
EXTD=now) of a career Navy Petty Officer and the mother of 4 of the greatest k
EXTD=ids in the world and the grandmother of 8 and 2 grandsons-in-law. All just
EXTD=the most perfect people in the world. No great-grands yet, though. I'm no
EXTD=t pushing them. I helped raise them all.]\n\nDon bought an old guitar from
EXTD=someone around his home town of Shelby, NC (I happpen to have been born a
EXTD=nd raised, until I married and started following my sailor all over the wo
EXTD=rld,) 20 miles from Shelby in Gastonia) and taught himself to play it and 
EXTD=he went out and promoted himself and some of his friends who made up his b
EXTD=and, to different ones in Gastonia and Charlotte and several other dinky l
EXTD=ittle towns in NC and inched his way on out to Knoxville, TN and eventuall
EXTD=y to Nashville. When Country Music was Country Music.\n\nHe also told abou
EXTD=t helping his step-father pick cotton on someone's farm around Shelby, and
EXTD=would be looking up to the sky and God, and pray for rain because he knew
EXTD=there had to be a better way to make a living. He was right about that to
EXTD=o. The boy was a GENIUS! He left home at the age of 12 years old, because 
EXTD=his step-father insisted he had to help pick cotton. He roomed with his fr
EXTD=iends.\n\nI would say, again, truly, that Don Gibson was a true Genius. I 
EXTD=play his music constantly. I have for years, and everytime I put a differe
EXTD=nt album on, I find something that sounds new to me, knowing that I've hea
EXTD=rd it time and time again. The latest one is "You Win Again." I just can't
EXTD=get enough of it. I put my headphones on and play it over and over. The b
EXTD=ack-up musicians are awesome. Especially the piano (which I think has to b
EXTD=e Floyd Cramer, and the steel guitar picker, who I haven't been able to id
EXTD=entify yet. I'm thinking it might be Pete Drake, but there are others from
EXTD=that era and I can't pick their names out of my tired old brain right now
EXTD=One day I'll break out those booklets and figure out who it is. And then
EXTD=there was Chet and also the Jordanaires and another group that I want to 
EXTD=say was the Anita Kerr singers, but, again, it's late and I can't be posit
EXTD=ive. They're just very good. I'll look them up tomorrow. These CDs are of 
EXTD=such good quality that I hear Don above my head, the instruments come thro
EXTD=ugh my right ear and the Jordanaires through my left ear. I'm just totally
EXTD=amazed at the technology that has allowed me to rediscover his greatness.
EXTD=I thought they were great enough when I was playing my 45's on that littl
EXTD=e "suitcase" record player that Santa brought me one year.\n\nThe musician
EXTD=s names, composers, and almost nothing else is on the album that I have wi
EXTD=th You Win Again on it. They didn't do that back then, However, these box 
EXTD=sets have all the information you could ever want to know about the songs 
EXTD=on the CDs, listed in chronological order. I really like that. I'm constan
EXTD=tly dragging out my books to see "who was that playing that?" or "who wrot
EXTD=e that?" It tells me right there. As well as what day and what time it was
EXTD=recorded. I tell you it's all there. The Bear Family really know how to p
EXTD=ut these Box Sets together. I have several others including Elvis and Dick
EXTD=Curless. Unfortunately, You Win Again is not in the Box Sets. At least I 
EXTD=haven't been able to find it. So far, it's the only one that I've discover
EXTD=ed that isn't in the box sets.\n\nI wouldn't take thousands of dollars for
EXTD=my box sets by him. Nor any of my albums.\n\nAnother thing that impressed
EXTD=me that he told the interviewer. Elvis came out in the hall at the RCA st
EXTD=udio one day in Nashville, and heard Don picking with that 2 finger style 
EXTD=he had, and Elvis asked Chet "Who's picking that guitar like that?" Chet s
EXTD=aid "That's Don Gibson." (I can hear Chet saying it in my mind. He had suc
EXTD=h a unique way of talking.)Elvis said "I'd really like to learn to do that
EXTD=Will you ask him to show me how?" Chet knew Don very well, and he told E
EXTD=lvis that he, Elvis, needed to go ask Don himself. I don't know if Elvis a
EXTD=ctually asked Don, but Don told Chet to tell him to get his own 'licks'. H
EXTD=e wasn't showing him "nothing".. Laid back Don, wasn't impressed at all by
EXTD=that new racket coming out of the other side of the studio, nor the perso
EXTD=n performing it. I'm not being sassy here, because I was one of those scre
EXTD=aming teenagers wild about Elvis in 1955 and from then on, but I still lov
EXTD=ed my Don Gibson. They were 2 different types of music and I am very versa
EXTD=tile at picking the music that I like. No one will ever take Don's place t
EXTD=hough. I like Blues, Gospel, Bluegrass, Classical, Instrumental, you name 
EXTD=it and there are plenty that I love.\n\nAt last count, when I "googled" I 
EXTD=Can't Stop Loving You, it had been recorded and played more than any other
EXTD=song in history, including White Christmas and God Bless America and at t
EXTD=he time that number was over 7 million times. I don't know how "they" coun
EXTD=ted the plays, but apparently "they" know how to count.\n\nDon lived long 
EXTD=enough, self taught or whatever, to write over 400 songs.\n\nHe was living
EXTD=in a small trailer up above Knoxville somewhere and sat in there one day 
EXTD=and wrote 2 of his huge hits, right off the top of his head in a matter of
EXTD=minutes or an hour or so, and I can't recall which ones now, but it tells
EXTD=them in the box set. There are so many of his "huge hits" that I'd rather
EXTD=not speculate on it until I go get my books. So if you want to know, repl
EXTD=y to my review or buy the box set.\n\nHe said "I'm no writer. I just sit a
EXTD=nd make up words and they fit together somehow or other." Or he said somet
EXTD=hing to that effect. Same thing. I guess that's the way GENIUSES do it.\n
EXTD=\nAfter he retired though, he was reading some pretty heavy tombs of books
EXTD=and novels. He loved reading those books. I think I remember one being ab
EXTD=out Abraham Lincoln and another about Django (?) Rheinhart?? I can't remem
EXTD=ber how it's spelled and I'm too tired to go look it up. You get my drift.
EXTD=He had several favorites.\n\nHe ABSOLUTELY WAS A GENIUS.\n\nIf you're a D
EXTD=on Gibson fan you will most definitely never regret spending the money for
EXTD=this or the other 2 box sets. They are well worth the price.\n\nEven if y
EXTD=ou're not a Don Gibson fan, you might become one.\n\nOne more little story
EXTD=from the booklet. Fred Rose had to retire from being the publisher of the
EXTD=songs most of those singers would put out, or whatever he was called. Fre
EXTD=d was in his 90's and was just probably spent out. His son Wesley took ove
EXTD=r. I might shouldn't be naming names here, but hey, it's published in that
EXTD=little booklet. Don and Wesley didn't get along. Wesley would come in the
EXTD=room and tell Don how to record this and how to sing that. It didn't work
EXTD=with Don. He didn't say much. He just went on recording the way he wanted
EXTD=to. Most of them were his songs, for crying out loud. Wesley would keep o
EXTD=n badgering him, and found that he wasn't getting anywhere with Don, and s
EXTD=o he told Chet to tell him. Chet said, "you might as well leave him alone 
EXTD=and let him do it his way - he knows what he's doing - and if you don't leav
EXTD=e him alone he might just tell us all to go to H (you can spell it) and go
EXTD=stomping out of here and we might not ever see him again." Sure enough, o
EXTD=ne day it happened. Don left and went to his mama's home in Shelby and sta
EXTD=yed 9 months.\n\nI JUST LOVED HIM.\n\nWell, I haven't told you all of the 
EXTD=interesting things from the booklets, so you really will enjoy buying them
EXTD=and reading them. Those are just my favorites.
