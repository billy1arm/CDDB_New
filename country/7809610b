EXTD=EVIEW:  In many ways, Willis Alan Ramsey's debut album makes him 
EXTD=sound like the archetypical Texas singer/songwriter - there's more
EXTD=than a little Guy Clark in his approach, a healthy dose of Towne
EXTD=s Van Zandt, a dash of Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and one can hear the 
EXTD=echoes of what Steve Earle and Lyle Lovett would draw from this m
EXTD=usic. But Ramsey's style -- an engaging mixture of cowboy poetry,
EXTD=post-hippie wit and wonder, and singer/songwriter introspection 
EXTD=- burst forth fully formed in 1972, while Van Zandt was still ba
EXTD=rely a rumor outside the Lone Star State, and Clark had yet to ma
EXTD=ke himself heard on vinyl - Ramsey was at once a contemporary of t
EXTD=he first wave of Texas songwriters, and one of the artists who bl
EXTD=azed the trail for what would become one of the most fruitful tri
EXTD=butaries of American roots music. While a number of artists cover

EXTD=t famously with "Muskrat Candlelight" -- retitled "Muskrat Love" 
EXTD=- though Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker, and even Jimmy Buff
EXTD=ett faired better creatively), one listen to the album is enough 
EXTD=to convince anyone Ramsey was as much a performer as a songwriter
EXTD=The bluesy drawl and frayed edges of Ramsey's voice convey a ro
EXTD=ad-worn maturity that betrayed his youth (he was in his early twe
EXTD=nties when he cut these sessions), and his production (in collabo
EXTD=ration with Denny Cordell) is remarkably intelligent and imaginat
EXTD=ive for someone with so little experience in the studio. From the
EXTD=tragic road story of "The Ballad of Spider John," the weary nost
EXTD=algia of "Goodbye to Old Missoula," and the Woody Guthrie tribute
EXTD=of "Boy From Oklahome" to the horny twang of "Geraldine and the 
EXTD=Honeybee" and the goofy music-biz meditation of "Satin Sheets," R

EXTD=rough the course of the album's 40 minutes. Part of the mystique 
EXTD=that has sprung up around Willis Alan Ramsey's debut album is tha
EXTD=t he dropped from sight after recording it (due to differences wi
EXTD=th his record company and a lack of enthusiasm for the realities 
EXTD=of the music business), and has yet to release a follow-up - while
EXTD=it's hard to imagine anyone whose heard it not hoping there's mo
EXTD=re where this came from, if your recording career was to be conta
EXTD=ined in a single album, you'd be very fortunate if it were as goo
EXTD=d as Willis Alan Ramsey. -- Mark Deming\n\nAmazon.com Editorial R
EXTD=eview\nA landmark of the progressive country movement, with some 
EXTD=of the sweetest, most memorable songs of the '70s, this album has
EXTD=both a rough and silky warmth, distinguished by Ramsey's bass, g
EXTD=uitar, and harmonica work, and by his great patience and musical 
EXTD=care. As good as the songs are, Ramsey's country-soul voice, owin
EXTD=g more to his Alabama roots than to Texas, is even finer. And eve
EXTD=n if you've never heard of him, you'll recognize his compositions
EXTD="Muskrat Candlelight" is notorious, and if that song makes you 
EXTD=wary, it shouldn't. Ramsey's version has a soulful glide and capt
EXTD=ures an elusive romantic tone. David Bromberg recorded "Northeast
EXTD=Texas Women" and Jerry Jeff Walker covered "Ballad of Spider Joh
EXTD=n," but the mythic air of Ramsey's originals--especially "Boy Fro
EXTD=m Oklahoma," the best song ever written about Woody Guthrie--has 
EXTD=never been equaled. Unfortunately, the reticent, demanding Ramsey
EXTD=never found that groove again, and while rumors of a follow-up h
EXTD=ave circulated for decades, his exquisite debut is all we have. -

EXTD=I have to say that this is a solid, solid album. It is the perfec
EXTD=t album for being mellow to. It just pulls you down and keeps you
EXTD=there. Once you read the Willis Alan Ramsey story on the web, yo
EXTD=u have to wonder why the second album never did happen. The moder
EXTD=n music industry would've squeezed old Willis like a lemon and go
EXTD=tten a dozen mediocre albums out of him. There would have been a 
EXTD=dozen sound alike albums put out to cash in on the craze. Instead
EXTD=, there is just one album, one hand crafted, lovingly done to per

EXTD=7 \nBy  Elliot Knapp (Walla Walla, Washington United States]\n\nS
EXTD=oul/country, you ask? I know, it sounds improbable, but it's true
EXTD=One his lone, eponymous album, Willis Alan Ramsey combines coun
EXTD=try subject matter and instrumentation with a smooth, soul-drench
EXTD=ed voice that wrings the emotion out of his fantastic original tu
EXTD=nes. This is truly one of those lost classics - music made by a ma
EXTD=n who knows what he's doing and should have made a whole lot more
EXTD=records. \n\nThe album's opener, "Ballad of Spider John," is mel
EXTD=low, but that belies the song's intensity. Ramsey proves an excel
EXTD=lent balladeer and his smooth voice achingly tugs the strings of 
EXTD=the song's story of a former outlaw whose lover leaves him when s
EXTD=he finds out about his dark past. Probably the most recognizable 
EXTD=song on the album (unfortunately for Captain and Tenille's lame c
EXTD=over) is "Muskrat Candlelight." When you hear Ramsey sing it, you
EXTD=understand that it's more than just an easy-listening novelty tu
EXTD=ne. The original version combines humor with a genuine tenderness
EXTD=that lends the song a real legitimacy. \n\nRamsey's beautiful vo
EXTD=ice doesn't prevent him from bringing his songs a bit of grit tho
EXTD=ugh--"Wishbone" and "Watermelon Man" are bluesy and spring with a
EXTD=lot of twang. Ramsey plays a lot of instruments on this album--n
EXTD=ot only guitar, but bass and lots of background vocals as well. I
EXTD=t's surprising how good he is at what he does--it sounds like a l
EXTD=ive band. \n\nReally what makes this album a lost treasure is its
EXTD=uniqueness. I've never heard a country album that has so much so
EXTD=ul blended effortlessly with genuine country sounds--it's nothing
EXTD=like the bland country pop we hear on the radio today, but it's 
EXTD=not straight-up country either. The best part is, it's a mellow l
EXTD=isten, but better than just background music. If you want an albu
EXTD=m that's good to chill to, but can also be enjoyed if you're REAL
EXTD=LY listening to it, this is a great choice. I guarantee it'll rew
EXTD=ard on repeated listens, and you'll wonder too why he never made 
EXTD=another album. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n"That ONE Willis

EXTD=ton, VA United States]\n\nMy brother used to play guitar in centr
EXTD=al/east Texas clubs in the late 70s and he met WAR and immediatel
EXTD=y became his no. 1 fan. He turned me on to him not too long after
EXTD=and ever since, when someone asks me for a recommendation, I imm
EXTD=ediately think of WAR. His storytelling is unique, his voice soun

EXTD=geous--Northeast Texas Women is a good example. Spider John is ab
EXTD=out a guy who gave him a lift when he was hitchiking to Dallas on
EXTD=e time and he listened to the guy talk. While the guy is somewhat
EXTD=more benign than the song implies, WAR made up a whole scenario 
EXTD=about his life based on a few things the guy said. And I could go
EXTD=on and on and on...talk about a singer/songwriter.\nJust this pa
EXTD=st weekend, while listening to NPR's American Roots, the teaser f
EXTD=or the next segment came on as I was about to get out of the car.
EXTD=Lo and behold, the announcer told me to stay tuned for a rare in
EXTD=terview with Willis Alan Ramsey, so of course I settled back to l
EXTD=isten. After living all over central and northeast Texas, he has 
EXTD=settled in Wimberley, a very small town southwest of Austin. When
EXTD=asked why only one album, he explained that he was only 21 or 22
EXTD=when the first came out and the attention was too overwhelming, 
EXTD=which made him resist ever getting in that situation again. Final
EXTD=ly, at around 50 (?), he's way more comfortable w/ himself and ha
EXTD=s begun to write and perform again. In fact, he's working on a se
EXTD=cond album. So, all you WAR fans, keep your eyes peeled for that 
EXTD=release (late this year, early next--I think?). \n\n\nAMAZON.COM

EXTD=rs., September 30, 1999 \nBy  H. Johnson "Hal Johnson" (Bella Vis
EXTD=ta, CA USA]\nNearly three decades after it was first released, it
EXTD='s a little ironic to recall that this recording, now a word-of-m
EXTD=outh legend, was initially considered a commercial flop.\nWillis 
EXTD=Alan Ramsey's start as a recording artist came about a little unu
EXTD=sually. After being snubbed by James Taylor's producer, Ramsey ap
EXTD=proached Leon Russell at his motel, following Russell's appearanc
EXTD=e in Austin with the Allmann Brothers. After listening to Ramsey,
EXTD=Russell invited him to California for another audition. The albu
EXTD=m that followed, recorded at various locations across the country
EXTD=, took a year to complete. While Russell's Shelter Records was wi
EXTD=dely considered a haven for those artists alienated by the big la
EXTD=bels, Ramsey still reportedly felt that the process of making the
EXTD=album came at the expense of too many artistic compromises. To h
EXTD=im, the music business was simply too much about business and not
EXTD=enough about music, even within the relatively loose constraints
EXTD=of "America's answer to Apple Records."\n\nWhile many "insiders"
EXTD=blamed Shelter Records for failing to support Ramsey's debut alb
EXTD=um, the surprising truth was that Ramsey himself asked Shelter no
EXTD=t to promote it. In an interview with Jan Reid, a journalist for 
EXTD=Texas Monthly magazine (and author of "The Improbable Rise of Red
EXTD=neck Rock," a fascinating account of the rise of the progressive 
EXTD=country scene of the time), Ramsey said: "I just don't like adver
EXTD=tisement. I don't like somebody to feel like they've got to shove
EXTD=something down my throat before I'll find out about it. Because 
EXTD=I know that people who listen to records as much as I do will gra
EXTD=dually hear one if it's any good. Let it stand the test of time."
EXTD=\n\nWords to choke on, perhaps, for a zealous capitalist, but I'd
EXTD=wager that most would agree that this recording has indeed stood
EXTD=the test of time. It's doubtful that Willis Alan Ramsey-a man wh
EXTD=o couldn't tolerate the oppressive influence of managers, agents,
EXTD=and journalists-will ever be a household name, act in a movie, o
EXTD=r make big bucks off of beer commercials. He might never release 
EXTD=another recording. That's regrettable, I suppose. Ultimately, tho
EXTD=ugh, we should forget the regret and rejoice that this treasure o
EXTD=f a recording is available again. It endures as a gift from the s
EXTD=oul of a remarkable artist, a man who refused to allow himself to
EXTD=be molded into a commodity. In the prophetic words of Mr. Ramsey

EXTD=tt released "Step Inside This House," the only brushes with the w
EXTD=ork of Willis Alan Ramsey most folks had were via The Captain and
EXTD=Tennille's version of "Muskrat Love," or perhaps Jimmy Buffett's
EXTD=cover of "The Ballad of Spider John." Thanks to the release of "

EXTD=prompt the re-release of Willis Alan Ramsey's self-titled album.
EXTD=Originally released in the 70's, this album made a huge splash w
EXTD=ith fans of the Austin-based music scene of that period. However,
EXTD=Ramsey chafed under the constraints of the music business-even w

EXTD=est of my knowledge, he never released another recording. (Until

EXTD=named one more: "Willis Alan Ramsey." This recording truly is a
