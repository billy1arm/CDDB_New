EXTD=n Released February 22, 2000\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (Going Where The Lonely
EXTD=Go) Recorded after his Columbia hit Big City, Going Where the Lonely Go i
EXTD=s one of Merle Haggard's most criminally overlooked recordings. Recorded i
EXTD=n 1982, the vibe is one of Haggard's most laid-back albums, co-produced wi
EXTD=th Lewis Talley, one of Nashville's kings of understatement (not that ther
EXTD=e are many). Haggard wrote over half the album, the rest comprised of two 
EXTD=songs by his then-wife, Leona Williams - a co-write with Little Jimmy Dicke
EXTD=ns - Willie Nelson's "Half a Man" - and Jimmy Davis' "Nobody's Darlin' but M
EXTD=ine." But it is Haggard's songs that make this a stellar outing. The title
EXTD=track is a piece of pure country poetry. A painfully slow 4/4 time signat
EXTD=ure fronted by a bassline, adorned by a three-chord pattern, and filled by
EXTD=slippery piano lines, Haggard sings, "Rollin' with the flow/Goin' where t
EXTD=he lonely go/Anywhere the lights are low/Goin' where the lonely go/Makin' 
EXTD=up things to do/Not runnin' in all directions tryin' to find you/I'm just 
EXTD=rollin' with the flow/Goin' where the lonely go/And I've got to keep goin'
EXTD=/I can't lay down/Sleep won't hardly come/Where there's loneliness all aro
EXTD=und/I've got to keep goin'/Travellin' down this lonesome road/I'll be roll
EXTD=in' with the flow/Goin' where the lonely go." As Haggard gets to the bridg
EXTD=e, a steel guitar and lead guitar trade lines as strings fall in from the 
EXTD=edges and cascade around his gorgeous, bluesy voice. The next track, "Why 
EXTD=Am I Drinkin'?," is pure honky tonk blues, full of heartbreak and resignat
EXTD=ion when he asks the question, "Is love just another word for memory?/And 
EXTD=is love just another word for pain?/The question is love really the answer
EXTD=/And if so why is love so much to blame/If love is what we're really after
EXTD=, then why am I runnin' away?/And why am I drinkin'/Why am I hurtin' this 
EXTD=way?" The guitars and fiddles wend their way around Norm Hamlett's gorgeou
EXTD=s pedal steel and drive home the desolate edge in the song. "I Won't Give 
EXTD=up My Train," another country ballad, is particularly poignant, as Haggard
EXTD=addresses the metaphor of his life in music via a brakeman who is married
EXTD=and probably won't be for long, because his wife is tired of always waiti
EXTD=ng for him. Hargus "Pig" Robbins' piano is unmistakable as it ushers in th
EXTD=e a narrative of paradox, contradiction, and loss. When Hag sings, "The ba
EXTD=by came in April in Chicago in the pourin' rain/With 12 black cars and emp
EXTD=ty tank/With three box cars and an empty sack of mail," we can hear Jimmy 
EXTD=Rogers in the grain of his voice, calling from out in the freight yards of
EXTD=history. Other notables are the truly moving "Shopping for Dresses (With 
EXTD=No One to Wear Them)," written with Dickens, and "For All I Know," another
EXTD=broken-love song from the other side of love's great divide. Haggard and 
EXTD=the Strangers were one of the tightest and most sophisticated bands in cou
EXTD=ntry music, inspired by the elaborate arrangements of Bob Wills' band, to 
EXTD=the point where Haggard's music from this period transcends country music 
EXTD=in its appeal and elegance. It's a pity this one didn't get the notice it 
EXTD=deserved -- it's a masterpiece. -- Thom Jurek \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (That
EXTD='s The Way Love Goes) That's the Way Love Goes is another decent collectio
EXTD=n of laid-back ballads that lets Haggard display some of the full range of
EXTD=his vocal talents, from the jazzy pop of "The Last Boat of the Day" to th
EXTD=e poignant lyric of "What Am I Gonna Do (With the Rest of My Life)." A cov
EXTD=er of Lefty Fizzell's "That's the Way Love Goes" ranks among the great Hag
EXTD=gard ballads. -- Matt Fink\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review (That's The Way 
EXTD=Love Goes]\nHere's one of the great, lost Haggard albums, originally relea
EXTD=sed in 1983 and telling his side of the story of his then-recent divorce f
EXTD=rom Leona Williams. The tone is bleak, funereal, without a single uptempo 
EXTD=stomp to break up the succession of one beautiful, heartbreaking ballad af
EXTD=ter another. Highlights are "What Am I Gonna Do (With the Rest of My Life)
EXTD=," which suggests that only time can heal these wounds and time can't move
EXTD=quickly enough - the deeply ambivalent "Love Will Find You" - and the title
EXTD=track, one of Lefty Frizzell's most agonizing and resigned deathbed compo
EXTD=sitions. Haggard ends his remake with a weary, defeated moan that sums up 
EXTD=the whole album and all his contradictory feelings of pain, pride, defianc
EXTD=e, pessimism, futility, and disgust. The crack band is more Western than c
EXTD=ountry, effortlessly supporting the mood of the songs. But there's no draw
EXTD=ing attention away from the star, whose rich, stunning performances make t
EXTD=he case for him as the stylist of his era. --John Morthland \n\nAmazon.com
EXTD=Customer Review (That's The Way Love Goes]\nBest album ever for the Hag, 
EXTD=December 12, 2001 \nReviewer: spraydoc from Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada 
EXTD=\nI bought this when it came out, and just recently fired up the old turnt
EXTD=able and gave it a listen. It doesn't have an era, it's timeless, just as 
EXTD=magic as the first time I heard it. I'm talking the whole album here... th
EXTD=ere is not a weak point on it. The instrumentation reflects off that great
EXTD=throat of Merle's and it really " Must have been Magic " . This album has
EXTD=more feelings overall than any other of Merle's... now I know there are s
EXTD=ingles, and some albums have numerous songs that come close, but not the w
EXTD=hole package. Buy this one if you've got any emotion at all!! \n\nAmazon.c
EXTD=om Customer Review (That's The Way Love Goes]\nMy Personal Haggard Favorit
EXTD=e, July 15, 2001 \nReviewer: chatfish from Indianola, MS USA \nIt's a myst
EXTD=ery why more cuts from this 1983 album don't make it onto the many "Greate
EXTD=st Hits" collections that proliferate like kudzu. I think it's the most pe
EXTD=rsonal and introspective of Haggard's many recordings, and his rendition o
EXTD=f the title track is a country classic. I remember going back and forth to
EXTD=my old turntable playing it over and over on vinyl. "Someday When things 
EXTD=Are Good" is another classic. Come to think of it, there's no weak materia
EXTD=l on this one and, to my mind, it's better than some of the "Merle's Great
EXTD=est" collections. \n\nAmazon.com Customer Review (That's The Way Love Goes
EXTD=]\nGreat Reissue, September 7, 2000 \nReviewer: Michael Carley from San Jo
EXTD=aquin Valley, CA \nIt's good to see this CD finally reissued. I hope they 
EXTD=will do the same with others from Hag's catalog.\n\nThe two hit songs from
EXTD=this CD are "Someday when things are good" and the title track, "That's t
EXTD=he way love goes". The latter won Hag his only Grammy, ironically, for a s
EXTD=ong he didn't write--it's an old Lefty Frizzell tune. \n\nThe other tracks
EXTD=are good as well. "Carryin' Fire" is the closest thing to an erotic song 
EXTD=you'll hear from Hag. "Last boat of the day" is a sweet song about a long 
EXTD=distance love affair. \n\nThe mood of this CD is not as downbeat or pessim
EXTD=istic as the Amazon review would lead you to believe. Rather, I would desc
EXTD=ribe it as bittersweet. Hag was writing and singing about the end of his m
EXTD=arriage, it's true, but it's from the perspective of someone who has been 
EXTD=through it all before, and seems to know he will go through it again. The 
EXTD=title track sets the mood with that theme, and the rest of the album suppo
EXTD=rts it. \n\nHalf.com Album Credits (That's The Way Love Goes]\nMerle Hagga
