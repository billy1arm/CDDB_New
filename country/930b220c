EXTD=the third album from Emmylou Harris, is another watermark. Taking the country-rock paradigm created by her former singing partner Gram Parsons with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Harris and her Hot Band made good on the promise that traditional country
EXTD=music could sidle alongside modern rock in the 1970s and make something timeless and true. This is also the place where Harris began recording the works of contemporary outsider songwriters in earnest. While the title track and "She" were written by

EXTD=EW\nHer best, maybe, February 26, 2007 \nBy  Peter E. Johansen\n\nActually, just about all the Emmylou Harris albums up until around 1980 qualify as her best. Whatever one I'm currently listening to seems at the time to qualify as her greatest work. 
EXTD=But regardless of how it compares to her other albums, this is sublime country - rock of the highest possible quality. It's got all the elements that make her albums of this era great: top shelf musicians (including Ricky Skaggs), a couple Gram Parso
EXTD=ns covers ("She", "Luxury Liner"), a Townes Van Zandt tune ("Poncho and Lefty"), and several classic country covers. Her version of "Making Believe" sends shivers down my spine and certainly holds up to Kitty Wells' original, and her versions of the 
EXTD=Carter Family songs "Hello Stranger" is also great. The only possible criticism I possibly think to apply to this album is that it follows a similar formula to her other 70s albums, so in this sense it could be seen as "formulaic", but what a great f
EXTD=ormula! \n\nAlso, while I sometimes consider the practice of adding bonus tracks to a CD dubious at best (typically I would prefer to listen to the album in its original form and perhaps have a separate disc with bonus material), I have to say that t
EXTD=he bonus track "Me and Willie" is one of my all time favorite Emmylou Harris songs. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nEmmylou and the Hot Band rock out, June 11, 1999 \nBy A Customer\n\nEmmylou lets her hair down on this album, allowing herself and h
EXTD=er "Hot Band" to cut loose and rock a little more than some of her previous efforts. And the results are dynamite. I hereby issue an open challenge to all Amazon.com browsers: I dare each and every one of you to try to listen to Emmylou's cover of th
EXTD=e Chuch Berry classic "C'est la vie" without tapping at least one foot. And when you ae done tapping along with that song, check out "Pancho and Lefty" and get lost in one of the finer country ballads ever written (kudos to Townes Van Zandt). Emmylou's
EXTD=take is a more contemplative, sparse recording than the more famous version by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, but I contend that it is far superior. I would go so far as to say that Emmylou's version on this album is the definitive recording of "P
EXTD=ancho and Lefty." And the rest of this album is brimming with similarly classic songs - the two Gram Parsons-penned tracks -- the title track, "Luxury Liner," and the emotionally wrenching "She" -- especially stand out. A classic album and one that no f
