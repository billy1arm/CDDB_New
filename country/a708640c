EXTD=ountry Sound, December 29, 2007 \nBy  Randall G. Arnold "texrat" 
EXTD=(North Texas]\n\nAs I've written in other reviews of Rex's albums
EXTD=, his renditions of western songs attracted me to the genre. Spec
EXTD=ifically, the album "Ridin' High" made me a fan. I was excited to
EXTD=see this 30-year-old album finally released on CD (and can't wai
EXTD=t for the rest of the Warner catalog to follow). \n\nI had only a
EXTD=passing familiarity with groups like the Sons of the Pioneers pr
EXTD=ior to Rex's introduction. I had thought western music to be quai
EXTD=nt and unimportant. This album cured me of such silly notions. It
EXTD='s not pure western, as the songs swing back and forth between th
EXTD=at style and honky-tonk, but the compilation never feels disjoint
EXTD=ed. The common thread is Rex's unmistakable desert-touched voice 
EXTD=along with solid, steady arrangements that never interfere. \n\nT
EXTD=he disc starts off with "Teardrops in my Heart", a mournful tune 
EXTD=covered not just by the Sons of the Pioneers but also such divers
EXTD=e talents as Jim Reeves, Ray Charles, Hank Snow and Teresa Brewer
EXTD=Rex takes some justifiable liberties with the lyrics and makes 
EXTD=a crying violin prominent in this simple but stirring production 
EXTD=that also includes a wonderful steel guitar. This song sets the t
EXTD=one for the rest of the album and is one of my favorites. \n\nHow
EXTD=ever, "Since I Lost Her to You" is in my opinion the best cut of 
EXTD=all. This sorrowful song of loss, made all the more poignant by h
EXTD=aunting harmonica and rich background vocals, shows off Rex's voc
EXTD=als at their best... from the soft, heartbreaking entreaties to a
EXTD=God both distant and personal to the emphatic chorus where the s
EXTD=inger bemoans the clinging mud of a state he's got no choice but 
EXTD=to leave. Backing vocals by Steve, Rudy and LaDonna Gatlin add a 
EXTD=soaring harmony. \n\nThere are a few songs that I have to rank as
EXTD=not bad or just decent. These include "I Love Everything I Get M
EXTD=y Hands On", "While the Feeling's Good", "Home-Made Love" and "Pl
EXTD=ay Me No Sad Songs". Not that they're bad numbers, but in my opin
EXTD=ion they don't come up to par with the rest. Rex does better on t
EXTD=he minor cuts that he wrote, such as "You're the Only One I'll Ev
EXTD=er Love" and the catchy, bluesy "I Gotta Remember to Forget You".
EXTD=\n\nRex puts his spin on some other standards besides "Teardrops
EXTD=". His almost a cappela rendition of his father's standard, "Stre
EXTD=ets of Lardeo", is the most chilling version I've ever heard. You
EXTD=can tell the song made an impression on him. He comes close to r
EXTD=ocking on Bob Will's "San Antonio Rose", placing his own rhythmic
EXTD=stamp on the classic swing number and apparently having a blast 
EXTD=in the process. I also prefer his cover of Carole King's "Crying 
EXTD=in the Rain" over the version made popular by the Everly Brothers
EXTD=Rex seems to put more heart into it, rendering a pop ditty into
EXTD=a true western ballad of despair. He's assisted by a guest vocal
EXTD=ist whom I believe to be Lloyd Nolan (of the Sons of the Pioneers
EXTD=). \n\nOf course this review would be incomplete if I didn't revi
EXTD=sit the centerpiece, Rex's own homage to his heritage, "Can You H
EXTD=ear Those Pioneers?". Bolstered by his dad and the Sons of the Pi
EXTD=oneers, Rex pays boisterous tribute to a time and music nearly fo
EXTD=rgotten in 1976 and barely acknowledged today. And as I came to a
EXTD=gree then and fully embrace now, yes I do believe it's time that 
EXTD=we put western back in the country sound! Thank you Rex for conti
EXTD=nuing to do so.
