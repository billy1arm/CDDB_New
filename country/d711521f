EXTD=11 years covered in this first of two Don Gibson retrospectives b
EXTD=y the German Bear Family label are the most captivating in his ca
EXTD=reer. Beginning in 1949, Gibson began recording as part of the hi
EXTD=llbilly jump band Sons of the Soil for Mercury. From the moment G
EXTD=ibson's lead vocal comes through the mix it is evident that even 
EXTD=if he wasn't writing a lot of songs at the time, he was performin
EXTD=g them as if they were his. Early on he issued four tracks, inclu
EXTD=ding the underground classic "Automatic Mama," a rockabilly proto
EXTD=type. A year later, Gibson and His King Cotton Kingfolks were at RC
EXTD=A working with Stephen Sholes and they issued eight sides that of
EXTD=fered a more complex version of the Sons' style of country, blueg
EXTD=rass, and pop, with just a shade of jump thrown in. In 1952, Gibs
EXTD=on moved to Columbia as a solo artist and recorded with Don Law a
EXTD=nd Troy Martin, and guitarist Chet Atkins, which is where his mat
EXTD=ure voice began to take shape, as evidenced by his first songwrit
EXTD=ing credit, "No Shoulder to Cry On," and a smoking version of Joh
EXTD=nnie Masters' "Walkin' in the Moonlight." His chart success was e
EXTD=vident, too, placing tracks steadily in the Top 40 of Billboard's
EXTD=country chart In 1955 Gibson moved again to MGM, where he record
EXTD=ed his first true smash and a bona fide country music classic: "S
EXTD=weet Dreams." Yet it wasn't until he returned to RCA in 1957 that
EXTD=Gibson made of himself a living legend in recording arguably the
EXTD=greatest two-sided single ever issued in the history of the genr
EXTD=e: "Oh, Lonesome Me" b/w "I Can't Stop Loving You," which sold no
EXTD=t only for him, but was redefined by Ray Charles on his legendary
EXTD=Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music album. The late MGM p
EXTD=eriod and his reunion with RCA is exhaustively documented here wi
EXTD=th alternate and unissued takes as well as unreleased tracks. Gib
EXTD=son was fortunate enough to be a big enough star when players lik
EXTD=e Floyd Cramer, Atkins, Rusty Kershaw, Buddy Harman, and Bob Moor
EXTD=e were redefining the Nashville studio sound. The gospel tracks h
EXTD=ere -- from the albums No One Stands Alone and That Gibson Boy, a
EXTD=s well as Sweet Dreams, which he re-recorded three more times bef
EXTD=ore the end of 1960 -- were all so far above the bar artistically
EXTD=that it was difficult for critics to define Gibson, hence his cr
EXTD=ossover into the pop world where he influenced a young Gram Parso
EXTD=ns among many others. In all there are 122 tracks on this four-CD
EXTD=set, and a fine booklet that offers exhaustive and accurate trac
EXTD=k information and a fine biographical essay. The sound is fine an
