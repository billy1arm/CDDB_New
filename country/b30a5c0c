EXTD=Originally Released January 27, 1998\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: When sisters Martie Seidel and Emily Erwin founded the Dixie Chicks in 1989, could they have possibly known the success that would someday be theirs? After three independent records and seve

EXTD=ie Chicks borrow a lot from 70's and 80's California pop-rock - unlike a lot of their peers, The Chicks go to the originals for their material, and cover songs written by J.D. Souther, Maria McKee, Tom Jans and Bonnie Raitt.... Until they can make a

EXTD=sed "Wide Open Spaces" - their major label debut. The CD, of course, was a huge smash and established them as one of the biggest country groups ever. In fact, with over 12 million copies sold, "Wide Open Spaces" is the best-selling CD ever by a coun
EXTD=try group (#2 is their "Fly" CD). After they released this CD, the group also won the Country Music Association (CMA) Award for Vocal Group of the Year in 1999. \n\nFive songs on the CD were major hits, starting with the "I Can Love You Better" (#7 
EXTD=in 1998), a playful up-tempo song. The group then scored three #1's in a row: "There's Your Trouble" (2 weeks in 1998), "Wide Open Spaces" (4 weeks in 1998), and "You Were Mine" (2 weeks in 1999). "Wide Open Spaces" has really become their signature

EXTD="Let 'Er Rip" also scored some airplay and peaked at #64, although it wasn't released as an official single. \n\nIn addition to these hits, the CD is filled with terrific songs. "Loving Arms" has been a hit before for several artists, including Elvi
EXTD=s Presley - the Chicks add some nice sweetness to it. Perhaps the prettiest ballad on the CD is the top-notch "Once You've Loved Somebody." I'm also impressed with "Give It Up or Let Me Go": a cover of a Bonnie Raiit song that the Chicks have made in
EXTD=to a serious barn-burner. \n\nI hadn't heard of the Dixie Chicks until this CD was released, so I don't have the bias against them that a few others seem to have - that is, thinking that the group "sold out." Although this CD is clearly more mainstre
EXTD=am than their older work (which I've heard on TV shows), their music is still more country-oriented than that of many contemporary hit groups. I really admire their music, and this CD is a great listen.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nFantastic music
EXTD=ians ! (a little note for fans), November 6, 2004\nReviewer: ira moon (Stikkittathamon, USA]\nI'm no fan of most of the country music that comes out these days, but I do like the Dixie Chicks. Call it male bias, but I do find female country singers 
EXTD=far more tolerable. \n\nMy appreciation of the Dixie Chicks, however, largely stems from the fact that I went to school with "Martie" (as she calls herself today) way back in the day. I can't say that I knew her, but I saw her play violin on several
EXTD=occasions and her considerable skill had clearly blossomed by 8th grade. \n\nI must say, I feel a strange sort of pride for her and sister Emily. Truth be told, it's more like a feeling of vindication, although I'm not one to hang on to ancient gru

EXTD=scent mind, that she was the prettiest girl in the grade. How funny: I had been so clueless. I'm sure that Martie, if so inclined, can look back on those grade-school days and laugh. As my mom would say, she is one smart cookie. The Dixie Chicks are
EXTD=top drawer hitmakers and deserve their success. I also admire their willingness to speak their minds which is their right as Americans. I wish them all the best.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nQuality album that catapulted Chicks to superstardom, A
