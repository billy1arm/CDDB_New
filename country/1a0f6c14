EXTD=s second Waylon Jennings box set covers the late '60s and early '
EXTD=70s, tracing Waylon's journey to outlaw country. Often, it's poss
EXTD=ible to hear him floundering as he tries to find the perfect bala
EXTD=nce between rock and country, sometimes flailing about admirably,
EXTD=other times feeling a little out of place. Still, this remains e
EXTD=ssential for any serious Jennings or country music fan. Even when
EXTD=Waylon wasn't quite sure of what he was doing, he made extraordi
EXTD=nary music, from the wah-wah-inflected cover of "Lonely Weekends"
EXTD=to the undeniable brilliance of his Honky Tonk Heroes material. 
EXTD=Six Strings Away is a travelogue of Waylon finding his voice -- a
EXTD=nd the remarkable thing is, not only does it deliver some of the 
EXTD=greatest country music of all time, but it winds up mirroring the
EXTD=evolution of the genre during those years.  -- Stephen Thomas Er

EXTD=ust 3, 2006\nBy Jess "Jess" (Coal Country, PA]\nHere's another im
EXTD=mense Bear Family Records Box Set - this one covers the early year
EXTD=s of the great Waylon Jennings. This is the pre-"Outlaw" Waylon, 
EXTD=before the hype and huge late-70's commercial success. There are 
EXTD=6 CD's here, all of them expertly mixed and with superb sound. Wh
EXTD=ile many of the songs included here are Cover songs, Waylon's tak
EXTD=e on them are as good or better than the originals. The first set
EXTD=of music is typical Waylon-style honkytonk, but is followed by W
EXTD=aylon's brief (thankfully) flirtation with Folk music. We are als
EXTD=o introduced to Waylon's take on the Bakersfield Sound - the influ
EXTD=ences of Wynn Stewart are unmistakable. As with all of the Bear F
EXTD=amily releases, there's a huge booklet (this one is actually hard
EXTD=cover, nearly the size of a large phot album) detailing Waylon's 
EXTD=early recording career, with pictures from Buddy Holly and Faron 
EXTD=Young, and even a young Jessi Colter. This one is well worth your
EXTD=money and will provide hours of listening pleasure. A+\n\n
