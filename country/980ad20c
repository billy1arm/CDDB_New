EXTD=from traditional country balladry to honky tonk to country-pop, b
EXTD=ut on this second effort, her varied styles have melded into a pr
EXTD=osaic Nashville sound for the '90s. To be sure, Womack's voice, a
EXTD=n achingly sweet instrument not unlike Dolly Parton's, is still o
EXTD=ne of the best in country music, but stylistically, there's littl
EXTD=e here to hold the listener's interest. "A Little Past Little Roc
EXTD=k" is a prime example. Lyrically, the song is predictable: "I'm a
EXTD=little past Little Rock and a long way from over you." The strin
EXTD=gs from the Nashville String Machine and the "ooh"s and "ah"s in 
EXTD=the background contribute to the blandness of the track, and even
EXTD=such studio stars as Brent Mason on electric guitar and Jelly Ro
EXTD=ll Johnson on harmonica only play tastefully and without inspirat
EXTD=ion. The album's hilarious highlight, "I'll Think of a Reason Lat
EXTD=er," sounds like anything else on the radio in the late '90s, but
EXTD=on this album it stands out from the too laid-back sound of the 
EXTD=rest of the songs. It seems that producer Mark Wright has made an
EXTD=effort to soften Womack's sound to make it more palatable to cou
EXTD=ntry radio, but in the process he has removed the soul of her mus

EXTD=material on Womack's sophomore effort treads well within the uns
EXTD=poken boundaries of Nashville romance (broken hearts, unrequited 
EXTD=love), there are a few gems that hint of a saucy character behind
EXTD=the sweet voice. "I'll Think of a Reason Later" is a funny, hone
EXTD=st portrayal of a woman meeting an old lover's new flame. "The Ma
EXTD=n Who Made My Mama Cry" is an unflinching dismissal of a prodigal
EXTD=father, and "I'd Rather Have What We Had" mourns for the steamy 
EXTD=affair that led to a now-mundane marriage. Supported by a pair of

EXTD=You Don't" and the absolutely hysterical "I'll Think Of A Reason
