EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This 36-track double-CD set, running just un
EXTD=der an hour and a half, effectively chronicles Johnny Horton's Co
EXTD=lumbia Records career. The first disc, which is in mono, traces H
EXTD=orton's honky-tonk work of 1956-1957, starting with "Honky Tonk M
EXTD=an." Though lacking the crossover appeal of his later work at the
EXTD=time, this is the material on which his reputation stands today,
EXTD=with people like Dwight Yoakam resurrecting it. The end of the f

EXTD=nsuccessful middle period, as be goes looking for a bit. He finds
EXTD=it, of course, with the martial rhythms and historical theme of 
EXTD="The Battle of New Orleans," a chart-topping novelty that leads t
EXTD=o a string of similar productions. By the end, in songs like "The
EXTD=Mansion You Stole," Horton seems headed toward the lush, string-
EXTD=filled Nashville Sound, though he died before it gained dominance
EXTD=Along the way, all of Horton's Country chart singles and most o
EXTD=f his pop chart singles are included, along with two tracks, prev
EXTD=iously unreleased in the U.S. Of course, the set could have been 
EXTD=considerably longer (or, better yet, shaved by a few tracks and f
EXTD=it onto a single disc), but nothing essential is missing. -- Will

EXTD=Horton¿The Essential Honky Tonk Man Lives On!, August 13, 2000 \n
EXTD=Reviewer: A music fan from Silver Spring, Maryland  \nFor those c
EXTD=ountry music fans who are only familiar with Johnny Horton's hist
EXTD=orical saga songs, this two CD compilation truly demonstrates tha
EXTD=t he was an original and diverse artist. Horton really shines on 
EXTD=the "honky tonk" tunes: "Honky Tonk Man" (most recently covered b
EXTD=y Dwight Yoakam), "I'm a One Woman Man" (most recently covered by
EXTD=George Jones), "Goodbye Lonesome (Hello, Baby Doll)," "Honky Ton
EXTD=k Hardwood Floor," "Cherokee Boogie" (most recently covered by BR
EXTD=5-49 and Marty Brown), and "The Golden Rocket" (nice version that
EXTD=would please Hank Snow). Some interesting tunes worth checking o
EXTD=ut: "Hot in the Sugarcane Field," "Lost Highway" (good version of
EXTD=Hank Williams, Sr. classic), "Evil Hearted Me," and "I'll Do It 
EXTD=Every Time" (almost Everly Brothers in feel). There is some fille
EXTD=r on these CDs, but it's mostly listenable and enjoyable in its o
EXTD=wn way. There are two notable omissions on this compilation that 
EXTD=would render his "Greatest Hits" package unnecessary for purchase
EXTD=(unless your really want some of the historical saga songs)--"Wh
EXTD=ispering Pines" and "All for the Love of a Girl." These are two o
EXTD=f the best ballads (and songs!) that Horton ever recorded. Why ar
EXTD=e they missing here? Otherwise, this is a terrific collection. \n
