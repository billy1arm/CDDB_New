EXTD=the last of Earle's pre-prison and personally dark years. Culled
EXTD=from the track lists of the songwriter's seminal MCA catalog, wh
EXTD=ich includes monumental releases like Guitar Town and Copperhead 
EXTD=Road, the songs on this live effort are unrepentant, almost effus
EXTD=ive odes to hard-living, blue-collar American life, rich with the

EXTD=is band the Dukes, Earle blasts through country-rock (in the grea
EXTD=test sense of the term) anthems and heartbreakers like "Devil's R
EXTD=ight Hand" and "Copperhead Road." A couple upbeat rockabilly numb
EXTD=ers like "Snake Oil," twangy ballads like "Billy Austin," and nic
EXTD=e covers (most notably the Jagger/Richards-penned "Dead Flowers")
EXTD=get tossed in to add to the live show's dynamic, making the whol

EXTD=: kireviewer (Sunnyvale, Ca United States]\n\nThis is a live CD t
EXTD=hat has been overdubbed in parts due to "technical difficulties".
EXTD=It gives the CD a strange sound, like someone playing along to t
EXTD=heir favorite songs. \n\nThis is Steve Earle just before he fell 
EXTD=completely over the deep end. Normally, that might not be a bad t
EXTD=hing. People like Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan have actual
EXTD=ly lost thier spark once they cleaned up. Sad to say, but some of
EXTD=the greatest music of all time comes from the drug addicted, inc

EXTD=x. \n\nBut, the problem with Earle is that he may have been too f
EXTD=ar gone. The other guys kept it under control and let it out in t
EXTD=heir music. Earle is paranoid and edgy. \n\nBecause of the sound 
EXTD=problems and the performance, this not a great live CD. I think t
EXTD=he studio versions of these songs are much better. \n\nEarle does
EXTD=have a lot to say. But, I'm not sure that I always agree with Ea
EXTD=rle's good ol' boy, loser, paranoic view that the world is out to
EXTD=get you and that there is nothing you can do. I am also not so s

EXTD=rle and the experienced Dukes performing at their peak-Earle, how
EXTD=ever, was in the depths of his drug addiction during this tour, s
EXTD=o the performances are restless at best. A live reference to an i
EXTD=ncident in Ottawa points to Earle's growing spirit of social cons
EXTD=cienceness. His stellar writing rescues this project, with new to
EXTD=ur staples such as the anti-death penalty anthem "Billy Austin," 
EXTD=the auto-biographical "I'm The Other Kind," and "West Nashville B
EXTD=oogie," (all from "The Hard Way") providing shining moments. A te
EXTD=asing "Guitar Town" is tell-tale: there are only shreds remaining
EXTD=of the exhuberant 27-year-old laureate who took the country and 
EXTD=rock communities by storm only 4 years earlier. Most frightening 
EXTD=is a transcending, gut-level version of Jimmy Rogers' "Blue Yodel
EXTD=#9," showing that Earle remembers from whenst he came, but leavi

EXTD=hoo-hah about "poor choice of songs?" I've always thought that th

EXTD=is there to pick nits over? The live version of "Billy Austin" (w
EXTD=ith that unbelievable opening guitar that gives ya the willies...
EXTD=BRRR!) is all by itself worth buying the album for! The version o

EXTD=far as foregoing this beaut in favor of the studio albums, get th

EXTD=ecause they aren't a verbatim recital of their studio recordings,
EXTD=then "Shut Up..." is right up your alley. This is a "dangerous" 
EXTD=album - a real, honest-to-pete rock n' roll record. It sounds as i
EXTD=f it could blow apart at any second, and just maybe take you, the
EXTD=listener, right along with it.
