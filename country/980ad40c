EXTD=Originally Released September 22, 1998 \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: On Lee Ann Womack's self-titled debut album, she moved effortlessly from traditional country balladry to honky tonk to country-pop, but on this second effort, her varied styles have melded
EXTD=into a prosaic Nashville sound for the '90s. To be sure, Womack's voice, an achingly sweet instrument not unlike Dolly Parton's, is still one of the best in country music, but stylistically, there's little here to hold the listener's interest. "A Li
EXTD=ttle Past Little Rock" is a prime example. Lyrically, the song is predictable: "I'm a little past Little Rock and a long way from over you." The strings from the Nashville String Machine and the "ooh"s and "ah"s in the background contribute to the bl
EXTD=andness of the track, and even such studio stars as Brent Mason on electric guitar and Jelly Roll Johnson on harmonica only play tastefully and without inspiration. The album's hilarious highlight, "I'll Think of a Reason Later," sounds like anything
EXTD=else on the radio in the late '90s, but on this album it stands out from the too laid-back sound of the rest of the songs. It seems that producer Mark Wright has made an effort to soften Womack's sound to make it more palatable to country radio, but
EXTD=in the process he has removed the soul of her music. Hopefully, next time out they'll return to the style that brought her a CMA Female Vocalist of the Year nomination in 1998.  -- Brian Wahlert\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nWhile much of the mate
EXTD=rial on Womack's sophomore effort treads well within the unspoken boundaries of Nashville romance (broken hearts, unrequited love), there are a few gems that hint of a saucy character behind the sweet voice. "I'll Think of a Reason Later" is a funny,
EXTD=honest portrayal of a woman meeting an old lover's new flame. "The Man Who Made My Mama Cry" is an unflinching dismissal of a prodigal father, and "I'd Rather Have What We Had" mourns for the steamy affair that led to a now-mundane marriage. Support
EXTD=ed by a pair of Vince Gill duets, Some Things I Know effectively balances country music convention with honest emotion. --Alexandra Russell \n\nUSA Today\nThey simply don't make country albums any finer than Some Things I Know. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOME
