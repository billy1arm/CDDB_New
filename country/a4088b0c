EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  To Lefty From Willie is an affectionate and
EXTD=thoroughly enjoyable salute to Lefty Frizzell, featuring stellar
EXTD=versions of a number of Lefty's best-known songs -- including "A
EXTD=lways Late (With Your Kisses)," "She's Gone, Gone, Gone," "I Neve
EXTD=r Go Around Mirrors," and "That's the Way Love Goes" -- plus reve
EXTD=aling takes on a number of obscurities from the influential vocal
EXTD=ist's catalog. Nelson is respectful without being overly reverent
EXTD=ial, giving his own spin to each song without abandoning their ho
EXTD=nky tonk roots.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIE
EXTD=W:  The remastered and expanded edition of To Lefty From Willie, 
EXTD=truly one of Willie Nelson's classic recordings, is worth the cas
EXTD=h for a number of reasons. The first is that it features as its l
EXTD=one bonus track an absolutely killer rendition of "If You've Got 
EXTD=the Money I've Got the Time" from a different recording session. 
EXTD=It's live in the studio and blows away the version of Willie and 
EXTD=Family Live. Another is that the sound brings a warmth to this se
EXTD=t that was missing from the shrill transfer of the set when it fi
EXTD=rst appeared on CD. Finally, and most importantly, this remaster 
EXTD=presents yet another opportunity for fans and those who may be di
EXTD=scovering Nelson for the first time to become acquainted with two
EXTD=of the most kindred spirits in the history of country music. Nel
EXTD=son and Lefty Frizzell were made for each other. Frizzell compose
EXTD=d songs that were meant to be sung. Their meanings came out in th
EXTD=e grain of the singer's voice, and this was certainly true on his
EXTD=own recordings. Nelson, who arguably has the most recognizable m
EXTD=ale voice in the history of the music with the possible exception
EXTD=of George Jones, turns Frizzell's words into emotions before sen
EXTD=ding them out into a microphone. These narratives, broken love so
EXTD=ngs, memories, and ruminations on the blessings and hardships of 
EXTD=life are living entities in Nelson's interpretations. "Mom and Da
EXTD=d's Waltz" has no false sentimentality. "I Love You a Thousand Wa
EXTD=ys" is a declaration without boasting. "Always Late With Your Kis
EXTD=ses" is sung with a kind of stunned resignation and heartbroken l
EXTD=onging that is taking place in the present in the protagonist's v
EXTD=ery being. "I Never Go Around Mirrors" is one of the most soothin
EXTD=g honky tonk songs ever recorded -- especially when the subject m
EXTD=atter is so wrenching. Nelson takes the edge off, but as a result
EXTD=the song becomes even sadder. The acceptance in "That's the Way 
EXTD=Love Goes" is one where the reward for patience is still one that
EXTD=can be squandered with a false move and one in which that false 
EXTD=move can never be known. The way Nelson turns the chorus in on it
EXTD=self and makes it a statement of undying love irregardless of the
EXTD=circumstances or whatever comes next underlines the uniqueness o
EXTD=f Frizzell's lyric. The album proper ended with Nelson performing
EXTD=a song by Jimmy Buffett and Jerry Jeff Walker. The reason is not
EXTD=clear, but it feels like Frizzell might have written it, and Nel
EXTD=son delivers it in the same phrasing he uses for all of the Frizz
EXTD=ell tunes. To Lefty From Willie is known as the great lost Nelson
EXTD=record, and though it did get to number two, it remains one of h
EXTD=is least well-known outings but is certainly one of the best.  --
EXTD=Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nLefty Frizzell rema
EXTD=ins one of the most underappreciated artists in all of country-mu
EXTD=sic history - therefore, it's no surprise that this little jewel o
EXTD=f an album remains one of the most underappreciated in Nelson's v
EXTD=ast catalog. Recorded in the peak Nelson year of 1975 (but not re
EXTD=leased until 1977), To Lefty from Willie puts his personal stamp 
EXTD=on the Frizzell catalog while still upholding the spirit of the s
EXTD=ource material. This balancing act is tough for anyone to sustain
EXTD=, but Nelson has proven time and again his interpretive powers an
EXTD=d he uses them here to great effect. With his sister Bobbie gentl
EXTD=y and elegantly dancing across the piano, he delivers some of the
EXTD=most moving vocals he's ever recorded, adding some delightfully 
EXTD=understated guitar leads for good measure. Nelson's easy, natural
EXTD=vocal delivery--a Frizzell hallmark--is perfectly suited to thes
EXTD=e songs, and while his phrasing and tone is much different than F
EXTD=rizzell's was, he still hits the same emotional bull's-eyes. --Ma

EXTD=yperbolium (Earth, USA]\n\nNelson's 1975 tribute to Lefty Frizzel
EXTD=l, recorded the same year as his breakthrough LP, "Red Headed Str
EXTD=anger," wasn't actually released until two years later. It made a
EXTD=reasonable commercial splash on the album charts, spun off a hit
EXTD=single ("I Love You a Thousand Ways"), and then largely disappea
EXTD=red from discussions about Nelson's ouvre. Given the fruitfulness
EXTD=with which Nelson recorded in the '70s ("Shotgun Willie" "Phases
EXTD=and Stages" "Red Headed Stranger" "Stardust" and more), it's not
EXTD=hard to see why this album was overshadowed.\n\nRemoved from the
EXTD=context of Nelson's string of ground-breaking '70s releases, thi
EXTD=s affectionate tribute reveals significant charms. Like the best 
EXTD=of such albums, it melds elements of each artist, combining Frizz
EXTD=ell's iconic songs (along with a few more obscure items) with Nel
EXTD=son's idiosyncratic style. In particular, Nelson's singing style,
EXTD=with its unusual phrasings and stretched notes, gives these song
EXTD=s an edgy modernity -- much as Frizzell's originals did in their 
EXTD=own time.\n\nHighlights include the hymn-like reading of "Mom and
EXTD=Dad's Waltz," brilliantly mixing slip-key piano, harmonica and N
EXTD=elson's own gut-stringed guitar. The backing provides an emotiona
EXTD=l pulpit from which Nelson proclaims the song's sentiments. Simil
EXTD=arly, the desperation and sadness of "Look What Thoughts Will Do"
EXTD=could easily have been from Nelson's own pen. Even the sunnier l
EXTD=yrics, such as those to "I Love You a Thousand Ways," are more wi
EXTD=shful than positive, and, conversely, the sadness of "She's Gone,
EXTD=Gone, Gone" sounds more wistful than genuinely apologetic.\n\nNe
EXTD=lson's fine ears also picked up a few tunes not often associated 
EXTD=with Frizzell's own performances, including the superbly depresse
EXTD=d "I Never Go Around Mirrors," and the resigned "That's the Way L
EXTD=ove Goes." Legacy's remastered reissue augments the original ten 
EXTD=cuts with a previously unreleased take of Frizzell's very first s
EXTD=ingle, "If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time," and John Mort
EXTD=hland's newly penned liner notes flesh out the story of an album 
EXTD=that is often unjustly overlooked in Nelson's catalog. \n\n\nAMAZ

EXTD=and]\n\nOriginally released in 1977, this album is often overlook
EXTD=ed but it has much to commend it, not least that it helped to kee
EXTD=p the music of Lefty Frizzell alive. It was successful at the tim

EXTD=d, included a cover of Lefty's classic song, If you've got the mo

EXTD=track to this re-issue, but I understand that the version here i
EXTD=s an alternate take. I only have the original album without that 
EXTD=extra track so I cannot confirm it. Willie recorded some of Lefty
EXTD='s best-known songs together with a few less obvious songs. All o
EXTD=f them suit Willie's style ideally.\n\nThe first five tracks (Mom
EXTD=and Dad's waltz, Look what thoughts will do, I love you a thousa
EXTD=nd ways, Always late with your kisses, I want to be with you alwa
EXTD=ys) together with If you've got the money I've got the time, were
EXTD=songs that established Lefty as a force in country music back in
EXTD=the early fifties. She's gone gone gone and A lttle unfair came 
EXTD=later in Lefty's career. Though less successful, Willie chose wel
EXTD=l in selecting these songs to record. The remaining three songs (
EXTD=I never go around mirrors, That's the way love goes, Railroad lad
EXTD=y) were songs that Lefty recorded near the end of his career in t
EXTD=he early seventies. Without this tribute album, it is unlikely th
EXTD=at any but Lefty's committed fans would associate these songs wit
EXTD=h him. Indeed, That's the way love goes is generally associated w
EXTD=ith Merle Haggard, whose voice is very similar to Lefty's.\n\nWil
EXTD=lie recorded many fine albums, some of which appeal to people who
EXTD=don't normally like country music. My guess is that this album w
EXTD=ill mainly appeal to traditional country fans - if you are one, b

EXTD=y a collection of Lefty's own music.
