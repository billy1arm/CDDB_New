EXTD=Kentucky Girl was the first pure country record Emmylou Harris ever recorded. It has a stripped-down sound that is as close to the country bone as anything issued by Nash Vegas in the 1960s. Harris made the record this way for two reasons: she had i
EXTD=nvolved herself deeply in the studio mixing of Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town and found it too glossy, and she was responding to the country purists who claimed the only reason she hit the charts so heavily with her albums was that she saturated the
EXTD=m with pop songs. This is just crazy, but it was a gauntlet she chose to pick up. As was customary, husband Brian Ahern produced the ten-song set, and Harris played acoustic guitar on all but two of the album's ten tracks while fronting the Hot Band.
EXTD=The material ranged from "Sister's Coming Home," a duet with Tanya Tucker written by Willie Nelson, to Dallas Frazier's stellar nugget "Beneath Still Waters," to Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman's "Hickory Wind," from the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rode

EXTD=one single.  -- Jason Ankeny\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nEmmylou Harris focuses more intently on her country ancestry with this 1979 record, tackling songs made famous by Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn, and the Louvin Brothers. However, the most rew
EXTD=arding cuts are the lesser-known gems: Willie Nelson's rollicking "Sister's Coming Home" (with Tanya Tucker), Dallas Frazier's aching ballad "Beneath Still Waters" (which hit No. 1 for Harris), and Jean Ritchie's moving folk song "Sorrow in the Wind.

EXTD=Rating: A-  Entertainment Weekly (02/27/2004]\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nMy favorite Emmylou album, April 15, 2004 \nBy  Peter Durward Harris "Pete the music fan" (Leicester England]\n\nEmmylou has recorded many brilliant albums throughout her
EXTD=career but the string of albums that she recorded between 1975 and 1980 are ultimately her most important legacy. Everybody has his or her favorite - this is mine, perhaps because traditional country is what I like best, and that's what this album i
EXTD=s filled with.\n\nThe set opens with Sister's coming home, an up-tempo song written by Willie Nelson, on which Tanya Tucker joins Emmylou for an incredible duet. I love Willie's music, but Emmylou and Tanya's version of this song is far superior to W
EXTD=illie's original.\n\nNext comes the superb ballad, Beneath still waters, a hitherto obscure George Jones song, which provided Emmylou with a country number one hit. Even better is Save the last dance for me, also a huge country hit for Emmylou. I've 
EXTD=heard countless versions of this song including the original Drifters version as well as brilliant covers by Buck Owens and others, but this is the best I've ever heard.\n\nAmong the other great covers here are Rough and rocky (Flatt and Scruggs), Hi
EXTD=ckory wind (a Gram Parsons song that first appeared on the classic album Sweethearts of the rodeo by the Byrds), Sorrow in the wind (Jean Ritchie - the song is sometimes titled Sweet sorrow in the wind), They'll never take his love from me (Hank Will
EXTD=iams) and Every time you leave (Louvin Brothers) - with Don Everly. \n\nThe title track, Blue Kentucky girl, was an early Loretta Lynn country hit that might have faded into obscurity but for Emmylou's revival of it.\n\nThe album (as originally relea
EXTD=sed) closes with one of my favorite country songs, Even cowgirls get the blues. Written by Rodney Crowell and with friends Dolly and Linda joining in, this is brilliant, although more restrained than Lynn Anderson's rousing up-tempo version, which is
EXTD=equally brilliant. Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings later recorded the song on their Heroes duet album, and they also did a great job with it.\n\nTwo bonus tracks have been added to this re-mastered edition, including a cover of Cheatin'is, originall
EXTD=y recorded by the talented but under-appreciated Barbara Fairchild.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best albums ever recorded by anybody in any genre of music. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nYes, LP version!, September 30, 2008 \nBy
EXTD=R. K. Lee (SF, CA]\n\nThe transition from LP to the original CD was botched. The song Even Cowgirls Get the Blues got its first verse cut off, giving it an odd start. This remastered CD has the complete song that was on the LP. The sound of this CD
EXTD=seems a bit fuller than the other one. I guess the two extra songs on the CD justifies a new release, but I didn't care for them. The restored song on the new one is reason enough.
