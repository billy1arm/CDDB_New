EXTD=AMG REVIEW: A legendary record recorded by a legendary group of musici
EXTD=ans. Area Code 615 was, as the name implies, the location of Cinderell
EXTD=a Studios in Nashville (Madison, to be exact). The session players tha
EXTD=t recorded here are some of the greatest unsung heroes in popular musi
EXTD=c: Weldon Myrick (pedal steel), Bobby Thompson (banjo), Buddy Spicher 
EXTD=(fiddle), Mac Gayden and Wayne Moss (lead guitar), Charlie McCoy (harp
EXTD=), Ken Buttrey (drums), David Briggs (piano) and Norman Putnam (bass).
EXTD=These players performed miracles on hundreds of records, including th
EXTD=ose by Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, The Beau Brummels, Ian and Sylvia, and co
EXTD=untless others. This, their "group" debut", is a timeless excursion in

EXTD=sive, sounding often like a visiting Eric Clapton in 1969. It's that g
EXTD=ood. Buttrey and Putnam, though, are the real stars here, laying down 
EXTD=the most solid, knee-deep funk and soul that you will ever hear. Absol
