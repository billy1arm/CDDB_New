EXTD=G EXPERT REVIEW: Tammy Wynette's 1967 debut album is still one of
EXTD=her best. Having secured the services of countrypolitan producer
EXTD=Billy Sherrill and an Epic contract in 1966, she cut her first s
EXTD=ingle, "Apartment No. 9," and first big hit, "Your Good Girl's Go
EXTD=nna Go Bad," both of which are included here. And while some of t
EXTD=he other material here doesn't quite match the quality of those g
EXTD=ems, the album still contains enough solid sides, like "Walk Thro
EXTD=ugh This World With Me" and "Send Me No Roses," to ensure its ess
EXTD=ential status. Add to that stellar covers of the David Houston hi
EXTD=t "Almost Persuaded" and Loretta Lynn's "Don't Come Home a Drinki
EXTD=ng (With Loving on Your Mind)," and you have one of the classic d
EXTD=ebuts in country music. -- Stephen Cook \n\nAmazon.com Customer R

EXTD=s, Tammy's debut album, includes her first hit, Apartment number 
EXTD=nine. It was only a minor country hit but it was followed by Your
EXTD=good girl's gonna go bad, which was a major country hit. It didn
EXTD='t quite get to the top, but Tammy did not have to wait long for 
EXTD=her first number one, although it wasn't on this album.\n\nThe al
EXTD=bum contains many covers of contemporary country songs, including
EXTD=Don't come home a-drinking (Loretta Lynn), Don't touch me (Jeann
EXTD=ie Seely), There goes my everything (Jack Greene - Elvis and Enge
EXTD=lbert both had pop hits with it), Walk through this world with me
EXTD=(George Jones) and Almost persuaded (David Houston). It also inc
EXTD=ludes I wound easy, which is the only song ever written by Dolly 
EXTD=that Tammy ever covered. At the time, Dolly was even less well kn
EXTD=own than Tammy.\n\nMost of the above songs are well known and bri
EXTD=lliantly performed, but the four obscure songs (All night long, C

EXTD=) \nTammy's "No Show" husband is nowhere to be found on this CD. 
EXTD=His absence will never be noticed. "Good Girl" contains 2 of Tamm

EXTD=the Spring of 1967 and "Apartment #9", which may be the best know

EXTD=solo (!) versions of "Walk Through This World With Me" and "Almo

EXTD=wer's favorite tracks were 2 that never made the charts at all: "
EXTD="I'm Not Mine to Give" and "I Wound Easy (but I Heal Fast)". That
EXTD=had to be true for Tammy in her complex personal life. Billy She

EXTD=This was the album that introduced Tammy Wynette to the music wor

EXTD=producer, Billy Sherrill, trying to find the right songs for her 
EXTD=one of a kind voice ("the voice with the teadrop with in"). The c
EXTD=ollection contains her first single, a minor hit, "Apt. #9", and

EXTD=ynette and Sherrill win sometimes with the likes of 'Send Me No Ros

EXTD=What makes YOUR GOOD GIRL'S GONNA GO BAD different is that Wynet
