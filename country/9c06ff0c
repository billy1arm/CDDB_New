EXTD=e track to The Race Is On is one of George Jones' biggest hits. W
EXTD=ith its galloping beat and clever, funny lyrics, the single gives
EXTD=the impression that the rest of the record is a return to Jones'
EXTD=honky tonk roots. Although there are several up-tempo numbers, T
EXTD=he Race Is On is dominated by ballads, like the majority of his U
EXTD=A albums. But The Race Is On boasts a stronger, more varied set o
EXTD=f songs than most of his '60s albums, ranging from ballads like "
EXTD=They'll Never Take Her Love From Me" and the Western swing of "Ti
EXTD=me Changes Everything" and the skittering honky tonk of "Don't Le
EXTD=t the Stars Get in Your Eyes." There are a couple of weak moments
EXTD=- ironically, one is "She's Mine," which was co-written by Geor
EXTD=ge -- but the album remains one of his strongest from the mid-'60
EXTD=s. ["It Scares Me Half to Death" and "Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me 
EXTD=Go)" also appear on Sings Like the Dickens! and "Time Changes Eve
EXTD=rything" appears on Sings Bob Wills.]  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
EXTD=\n\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nThe 1960s were the definitive decade 
EXTD=for George Jones, the era during which he fully developed his art
EXTD=istic persona. The effortless melismatic singing, the rich, emoti
EXTD=ve baritone voice, and the repertoire that perfectly blends jokey
EXTD=novelty songs and heart-wrenching ballads all came of age in thi
EXTD=s period. It should come as no surprise that Jones recorded many 
EXTD=of his signature songs, including "She Thinks I Still Care," "Goo

EXTD=ring the '60s.\nFor the early part of the decade, Jones recorded 
EXTD=for United Artists, and he rarely made a misstep on any of his tw
EXTD=enty-four albums for the label. THE RACE IS ON is one of the best
EXTD=, capturing a singular artist at the height of his abilities. The
EXTD=re are no weak tracks among the twelve included here. Highlights 
EXTD=include such up-tempo numbers as the title track and "Your Heart 
EXTD=Turned Left" - several well-wrought tear-jerkers ("She's Mine," "I
EXTD=t Scares Me Half To Death," "World's Worst Loser") - and some well
EXTD=chosen covers (Hank Williams' hit "They'll Never Take Her Love F
