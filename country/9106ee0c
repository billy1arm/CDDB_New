EXTD=ok the Sundazed label a while to reissue this one on CD. They did
EXTD=the Buck Owens Capitol catalog back in the 1990s and did a stell

EXTD=there were far more people interested in country gospel again. B
EXTD=ut this is no ordinary country gospel album. This isn't the Carte
EXTD=rs or the Louvins. This is honky tonk country gospel done Bakersf
EXTD=ield style. Owens toned down his Buckaroos approach not a bit to 
EXTD=record this. If anything, in listening to the opener, "Pray Every
EXTD=Day," or "When Jesus Calls All His Children In" or "Bring It to 
EXTD=Jesus" or the rollicking "Would You Be Ready," the slippery guita
EXTD=r and pedal steel-heavy arrangements make this record feel more l
EXTD=ike a late-night barroom drinking and dancing set than something 
EXTD=to be played for church. And that makes perfect sense. Didn't Jes
EXTD=us come to call sinners and not the righteous? What better way th

EXTD=uary 5, 2004 \nBy  hyperbolium (Earth, USA]\n\nThe bulk of this a
EXTD=lbum was recorded at the end of 1965, right in the middle of Owen
EXTD=s' phenomenal run of Bakersfield Sound recordings. The albums "I'
EXTD=ve Got a Tiger By the Tail" and "Christmas With Buck Owens" were 
EXTD=lighting up the charts, and the Buckaroos triumphant Carnegie Hal
EXTD=l concert was just ahead in 1966. This timing produced twelve ori
EXTD=ginal songs of faith that were written and recorded to the band's
EXTD=high-powered twang, rather than being adaptations of the band to
EXTD=a more traditional gospel sound.\n\nFrom the opening bars of "Pr
EXTD=ay Every Day," it's clear that the joyful sound of the Buckaroos'
EXTD=hits was perfectly suited to stories of prayer, bible and family
EXTD=Owens sings with the full-throated honky-tonk conviction of Han
EXTD=k Williams', but with harmonies (either his own, or those of Don 
EXTD=Rich) mindful of the Louvin Brothers. Add the twang of Telecaster
EXTD=s and pedal steel, and you have the soundtrack to Bakersfield's s
EXTD=alvation.\n\nOwens co-wrote many of the album's songs with the le
EXTD=gendary Red Simpson - he also co-wrote a pair of tunes, "Bring it 
EXTD=to Jesus" and "Eternal Vacation," with his mother, Macie. The alb
EXTD=um's title tune, along with "I'll Go to Church Again with Momma,"
EXTD=recall Macie's own mother, Mary Myrtle, and reflect on the suppo
EXTD=rtive family from which Owens' career sprang. The album is a Bake
EXTD=rsfield hymnal of waltzes ("Jesus Saved Me" "All the Way With Jes
EXTD=us"), two-steppers ("Would You Be Ready?" "Satan's Gotta Get Alon
EXTD=g Without Me"), and fiddle-and-steel weepers ("Dust on Mother's B
EXTD=ible"). Every one of them is stamped through-and-through with the
EXTD=classic Buckaroos sound.\n\nFor reasons unknown, this album was 
EXTD=not released with the bulk of Sundazed's reissues in the late '90
EXTD=s. Wrong finally righted, it's time for fans to rejoice and enjoy
EXTD=this essential entry in the Buck Owens catalog.\n\n4-1/2 stars,

EXTD=aybe the BEST Buck album, November 4, 2004 \nBy  Rene M. Passarie
EXTD=u Jr. (Carlsbad, CA]\n\nIn terms of sheer consistency and quality
EXTD=of songs, Dust On Mother's Bible might be the best Buck and the 
EXTD=Buckaroos album. I'm not a religious person, but these songs are

EXTD=ring "trivia buff" (Bethel, CT United States]\n\nIn 1966, Buck Ow
EXTD=ens released his first gospel album. Except for the fact that son
EXTD=gs are spiritual, the music sounds about the same as the music on
EXTD=Buck's other albums of the time period. The music is played by B
EXTD=uck's regular backing group, the Buckaroos. Unlike other singers 
EXTD=who added organs or choirs to their gospel records, Buck kept his
EXTD=sound intact. The songs were recorded in late 1965, except for t
EXTD=wo songs that were recorded much earlier in 1961. The songs are a
EXTD=ll originals, with most of them being written or co-written by Bu
EXTD=ck (Buck's mother wrote three of the songs with him). The songs a
EXTD=re all good, with "Dust on Mother's Bible" being the obvious stan
EXTD=dout. Buck's fans will enjoy this album, especially if they are r
EXTD=eligious.
