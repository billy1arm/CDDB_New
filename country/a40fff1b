EXTD=Untamed Hawk - Disc 4 of 5\n© 1995 Bear Family Records\n\nUPC: 40

EXTD=h 31, 1995\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: The thing that makes Bear Family
EXTD='s Untamed Hawk a little difficult to listen to for pleasure is t
EXTD=he very reason it's necessary for serious Merle Haggard fans and 
EXTD=collectors: Over the course of five discs, it contains all of the
EXTD=Capitol recordings (plus his early work for Talley) between 1962
EXTD=and 1968, including alternate takes and unreleased cuts. This is
EXTD=a bonanza, since from the outset, Haggard was one of the most re
EXTD=liable of all country singers, turning out consistently enjoyable
EXTD=work due to his terrific ear for material and excellent songwrit
EXTD=ing and performances. He certainly did record a few duds, or at l
EXTD=east unrealized tracks, during this time, but those are fascinati
EXTD=ng in context (either on the original albums or in this box set).
EXTD=Yet the consistency is rather remarkable - the singles are usuall
EXTD=y the standouts, but there are many tracks nearly as compelling a
EXTD=s well. This is all apparent on the original albums as well as Un
EXTD=tamed Hawk, but the box set may not be the best way to hear this 
EXTD=music, largely because of the sequencing. Like many Bear Family b
EXTD=oxes (or at least their sets from the '80s through the mid-'90s),
EXTD=this places chronological order before listenability, as it pres
EXTD=ents everything in session order -- which means that the alternat
EXTD=e takes and false starts slow the momentum of the sessions. This 
EXTD=is a problem, but it is one that can be avoided through judicious
EXTD=use of CD programming (or at least the fast-forward button), but
EXTD=it does also point out that this set is more for the historian t
EXTD=han the casual listener. That said, those listeners who want a co
EXTD=mplete set of Merle Haggard's groundbreaking '60s recordings will
EXTD=certainly not be disappointed with this, particularly because ma
EXTD=ny of these songs are not easily available on CD, even with the s
EXTD=traight-up reissues of his '60s albums. And, frankly, if you love
EXTD=Merle Haggard, it is worth investing in this set. His music may 
EXTD=have grown richer in the years after this set, but even at the ou
EXTD=tset, he was one of the most inventive, interesting, enjoyable, a
EXTD=nd flat-out wonderful country artists of his time, and it's all w
EXTD=orth hearing, from the singles to the album tracks to the cuts th
EXTD=at never were aired before this set. Even if not everything here 
EXTD=is perfect, the overall effect is pretty awe-inspiring all the sa
EXTD=me.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\n5
EXTD=CD box set of Merle's complete recordings for Tally and Capitol 
EXTD=from 1962 to 1968 (except the Jimmie Rodgers tribute available se
EXTD=parately). The classic early hits are here, like Strangers, Swing
EXTD=ing Doors, The Bottle Let Me Down, I Threw Away The Rose, Branded
EXTD=Man, Sing Me Back Home, Lonesome Fugitive, and Mama Tried, but t
EXTD=he importance of this set is that it shows Merle's developing art
