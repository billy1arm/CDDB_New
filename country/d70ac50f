EXTD=This 1985 performance of Merle Haggard and his swinging Strangers
EXTD=- with a two-piece horn section that sounds like five -- were i
EXTD=n fine form at Austin City Limits. There are 15 tunes on Live fro
EXTD=m Austin, TX many of them barn burners. It opens with "The Okie f
EXTD=rom Muskogee's Comin' Home," a fine choice since it's not a novel
EXTD=ty song. Haggard sticks to his own material most of the time, and
EXTD=he rambles over it, pulling from classics like "Mama Tried" and 
EXTD="Silver Wings," to newer material from the MCA and Epic periods -
EXTD=which were creatively fertile times for him. An example is in t
EXTD=he lovely "What Am I Gonna Do (With the Rest of My Life)," the fo
EXTD=urth tune in the set. But there are more, too, in "Place to Fall 
EXTD=Apart" and "I Wish Things Were Simple Again." There are two Tommy
EXTD=Duncan tunes here, where Haggard pays homage to his first real i
EXTD=nfluence, Bob Wills -- "Misery," "Take Me Back to Tulsa," and one
EXTD=by Wills, as well as "Ida Red." Thankfully, a great version of J
EXTD=ohnny Durrill's "Misery and Gin" is here from Back to the Barroom
EXTD=s, as is the wonderful closer, Haggard's own "I Think I'll Just S
EXTD=tay Here and Drink," to take the thing out on the right note. It'
EXTD=s true most could have lived without his pseudo-orchestral paean 
EXTD=to xenophobic political values, "Amber Waves of Grain," but it wo
EXTD=uldn't be a complete show without an accurate portrayal of the so
EXTD=ngwriter and the man. Haggard fans will dig this one just fine. -
EXTD=Thom Jurek\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nThough the perpetual
EXTD=ly touring Haggard has been known to deliver some perfunctory per
EXTD=formances, this 1985 Austin City Limits taping was plainly a deli
EXTD=ght for artist and audience alike. The recording (also available 
EXTD=on DVD) presents Haggard not as a living legend, delivering rote 
EXTD=renditions of all the hits that have made him one, but as a vital
EXTD=, creative artist keeping it fresh for himself as well as the fai
EXTD=thful. Sure, there are signature hits here, including the early "
EXTD=Mama Tried" (introduced with a lovely verse from "Tulare Dust") a
EXTD=nd the shimmering "Silver Wings." But performances such as the te
EXTD=nder vocal on "Thank You for Keeping My House" and the bitterswee
EXTD=t sophistication of "What Am I Gonna Do (With the Rest of My Life
EXTD=)" give even better indication of his expressive depth and subtle
EXTD=mastery. George Jones may be the most emotive country singer ali

EXTD=85, this performance by Merle Haggard and the Strangers for the l
EXTD=egendary PBS series Austin City Limits wasn't released until 2006
