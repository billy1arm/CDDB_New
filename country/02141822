EXTD=EXPERT REVIEW:  No other period of George Jones' long, legendary
EXTD=career is as murky and mysterious as his stint at Musicor, his h
EXTD=ome from 1965 through 1971. He left United Artists for Musicor af
EXTD=ter "The Race Is On" topped the charts in 1964, once again follow
EXTD=ing his producer, mentor, and manager, Pappy Daily, to new, seemi
EXTD=ngly greener pastures that just happened to be financially advant
EXTD=ageous to Pappy. George was UA's flagship country artist, but Mus
EXTD=icor had only one other hit-maker on its roster and that was Gene
EXTD=Pitney, the operatic pop singer who flirted with country music i
EXTD=n 1965, the year George joined Musicor, and a year after the Brit
EXTD=ish Invasion stole much of Pitney's pop audience. George and Gene
EXTD=cut two albums' worth of duets which brought them both a bit of 
EXTD=crossover, but Pitney's star continued to fade in the late '60s a
EXTD=s Jones' burned bright, so Daily did what any huckster would: he 
EXTD=ran his lone star into the ground, having him record almost 300 s
EXTD=ides in just over six years, flooding the market with singles and
EXTD=LPs, churning out records -- on Musicor as well as RCA and its b
EXTD=udget-line Camden offshoot -- well after George severed ties with
EXTD=Musicor and Pappy by buying out his contract in 1971. \n\nIn a f
EXTD=itting irony, this profligate parade of product found its counter
EXTD=part in an utter dearth of CD reissues of Musicor material. A han
EXTD=dful of cuts showed up on Rhino's 1991 The Best of George Jones, 
EXTD=the Pitney duets were collected on a generous 1994 CD by Bear Fam
EXTD=ily, the same years some cuts appeared on a two-disc retrospectiv
EXTD=e from Epic called The Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Coun
EXTD=try, but the bulk of the Musicor recordings remained unavailable 
EXTD=due to various legal reasons until 2009, when Bear Family release
EXTD=d all of them in two big box sets. Walk Through This World with M
EXTD=e is the first volume, covering the first two-and-a-half years of
EXTD=Jones' time at Musicor, a quarter of a decade that produced seve
EXTD=ral huge hits, many forgotten gems, and a bunch of standard-issue
EXTD=Texas honky tonk elevated by the natural grace of George and the
EXTD=grit of his Jones Boys. In a move that seems a test to prove whe
EXTD=ther the old adage of whether a great singer could sing the phone
EXTD=book is true, Daily would have Jones sing almost any old song, p
EXTD=rovided that he owned the copyright. He had a stable of regular w
EXTD=riters, most quite talented, working overtime to turn out materia
EXTD=l, and when that failed, he dug up public domain gospel numbers h
EXTD=e could arrange, then filled out sessions with current hits and r
EXTD=e-recordings. Since Pappy did have Leon Payne, Dallas Frazier, an
EXTD=d Peanuts Montgomery on his short list, he gave George lots of go
EXTD=od, sometimes great, songs to record, and unlike Col. Tom Parker,
EXTD=he wasn't loathe to have George cut a tune if his company couldn
EXTD='t get the publishing. That said, there are times during this box
EXTD=where it seems as if Daily was almost testing the old adage of w
EXTD=hether a great singer could sing the phone book and sound good. O
EXTD=f course, that's giving Pappy a bit too much credit -- he wasn't 
EXTD=there for art, he was there for commerce, picking songs and pushi
EXTD=ng Jones to break Musician's Union rules (according to George, th
EXTD=ey once recorded a full album in three hours, way beyond the unio
EXTD=n's three-song limit), but letting the singer conduct the band an
EXTD=d set the arrangements, something that's made clear by the sessio
EXTD=n tapes that conclude this five-disc box. This hands-off approach
EXTD=might explain why the first half of the Musicor years doesn't de
EXTD=part greatly from the sound of George's UA recordings - there are 
EXTD=a few cuts that show a heavy Roger Miller influence, and a few th
EXTD=at bear traces of the Bakersfield twang of Buck Owens, along with
EXTD=some Merle Haggard, but by and large, this is hardcore country w
EXTD=ith an emphasis on sweet, mournful ballads, and when it comes to 
EXTD=this sound, nobody does it better than George Jones.\n\nCertainly
EXTD=, there are varying degrees of inspiration in addition to song qu
EXTD=ality, but even when George and the Jones Boys are on autopilot, 
EXTD=this music is enjoyable, the sound of a working band working at n
EXTD=ear peak. True, it takes a dedicated listener to sort out the whe
EXTD=at from the chaff, to pick out gems whether they're forgotten sin
EXTD=gles like "Small Time Laboring Man" or excellent readings of the 
EXTD=gospel standard "Unclouded Day" or Lefty Frizzell's "Run 'Em Off,
EXTD=" or even to find the hits "Things Have Gone to Pieces" or "Walk 
EXTD=Through This World with Me," but the hunt is a large part of why 
EXTD=this set is fun. This may not be the biggest or best music George
EXTD=Jones ever made, but in a curious way, it's the greatest testame
EXTD=nt to his talent because it truly takes a great singer to keep so

EXTD=to litigation, George Jones's seminal Musicor recordings have be
EXTD=en in disarray for years. In 2009, the Bear Family label began to
EXTD=rectify this state of affairs by bringing out Jones's total Musi
EXTD=cor output in two deluxe box sets, complete with the excellent re
EXTD=mastering and documentation that the German label is famous for. 
EXTD=The 5-CD WALK THROUGH THIS WORLD WITH ME is the first of these co
EXTD=llections. On it one can hear the celebrated title track as well 
EXTD=as the great "Things Have Gone To Pieces," "Take Me," "Love Bug" 
EXTD=(recently reprised by George Strait), and other classic performan
EXTD=ces, including Jones's intriguing duets with Melba Montgomery, we
EXTD=ll before his celebrated collaboration with future wife Tammy Wyn
EXTD=ette. (His duets with teen idol and vocalist extraordinaire Gene 
EXTD=Pitney have been issued on another Bear box set). Many believe th
EXTD=at the country icon did his greatest work for Musicor before the 
EXTD=move to Epic Records with Wynette. The results are presented here
EXTD=for the listener to judge., The 12-track anthology WALK THROUGH 
EXTD=THIS WORLD WITH ME gathers a half dozen classic tracks by two of 
EXTD=the great country singers of all time. Both Patsy Cline and Georg
EXTD=e Jones deserve full anthologies (if not box sets), of course, bu
EXTD=t listeners wanting only a handful of hits such as "Walkin' After
EXTD=Midnight" and "A 'Good Year for the Roses" will be satisfied.\n\n

EXTD=han a decade as one of country music's top stars, newfound maturi
EXTD=ty and soulfulness augmented what was already the greatest voice 
EXTD=in country music. The six years from 1965 to 1971 that Jones spen
EXTD=t on Musicor Records were marked by personal turmoil and unpreced

EXTD=s, covering all sessions from 1965 until mid-1967. Until now, the
EXTD=Musicor sides were randomly packaged and many were unavailable, 
EXTD=but the two Bear Family boxes (plus one CD of duets with Gene Pit
EXTD=ney available elsewhere on Bear Family) will tell the complete st
EXTD=ory. Here are the fabulous original albums, including his tribute
EXTD=s to Dallas Frazier and the duet albums with Melba Montgomery, pl
EXTD=us such all-time George Jones standards as 'Things Have Gone To P
EXTD=ieces', 'Love Bug', 'Take Me', 'I'm A People', 'Four-O-Thirty Thr

EXTD=This World With Me'. It's all here in stunningly restored sound 
EXTD=together with ten previously unissued recordings, including fabul

EXTD=George Jones' Musicor publicity photo Throughout a stellar career
EXTD=that began in earnest during the mid-1950s, George Jones has bee
EXTD=n country's finest pure vocal stylist.\n\nA champion at heartache
EXTD=ballads and outstanding in every other style as well, Jones' bri
EXTD=lliance has kept him in good standing during periods of artistic 
EXTD=triumph and times of personal trouble. Though he's not heard much
EXTD=these days on contemporary country radio, many of the males (and
EXTD=plenty of the females for that matter) whose songs make those ti
EXTD=ght playlists are quick to cite their love for Jones' music and h
EXTD=is impact and influence on their work.\n\nAmong his many great pe
EXTD=riods, none were more consistently impressive than his time at th
EXTD=e New York based-label Musicor. Between 1965 and 1971, Jones and 
EXTD=longtime producer Harold "Pappy" Daily cranked out an incredible 
EXTD=280 songs. Some were good, many were classics, but there was inev
EXTD=itably throwaway and forgettable material due to the output and t
EXTD=he Daily penchant for rapid recording and one-take sessions. Jone
EXTD=s also operated in every conceivable song situation.\n\nThere wer
EXTD=e terse narratives and sentimental homages, numbers with intricat
EXTD=e (for three minutes or less) story lines and others with novelty
EXTD=pitches or humorous asides. Jones did duets and pieces with heav
EXTD=y orchestration, then would contrast those with sparsely backed s
EXTD=ongs and others featuring the backing of "The Jones Boys," a stud
EXTD=io unit that included fiddler Charlie Justice, steel guitarist So
EXTD=nny Curtis, drummer Glen Davis, guuitarist Jerry Starr and a bass
EXTD=ist named Johnny Paycheck, who'd later become a star as a vocalis
EXTD=t.\n\nJones also did many epic duets, teaming with at various tim
EXTD=es Melba Montgomery (his best partner during that time), Brenda C
EXTD=arter and even pop star Gene Pitney.\n\nVarious Jones' Musicor al
EXTD=bums have been circulating for years, but now almost his entire c
EXTD=rop of recordings for the label (except for those with Pitney) ha
EXTD=ve been compiled on two exhaustive boxed sets by Bear Family.\n\n

EXTD=cor Recordings 1965-1971, Parts 1 and 2 together assemble 273 recor
EXTD=dings on nine CDs (five on Vol 1., four on Vol. 2) plus comprehen
EXTD=sive and highly entertaining liner notes from Rich Kienzle (one o
EXTD=f the nation's premier country historians) and a full Jones disco
EXTD=graphy by Don Roy, Kittra Moore, Richard Weize and Guy Ewald. \n\n
EXTD=There's also alternate takes and false starts, a practice with bo
EXTD=xed sets that can be irritating, but does fully demonstrate the t
EXTD=weaking and adjustments that occur during sessions.\n\nThe greate
EXTD=st aspect of the set is hearing the marvelous Jones voice and app
EXTD=roach developing and evolving, as well as his ability to jell wit
EXTD=h partners Montgomery and Carter. His great mid-song shifts from 
EXTD=mid to high register, stretching out words and extending phrases,
EXTD=and dramatic emphasis were all perfectly utilized on many Musico
EXTD=r releases.\n\nThis period from a strictly commercial standpoint 
EXTD=might not have been his greatest, but it was clearly one of his b
EXTD=usiest. These Bear Family sets chronicle an important time in Jon

EXTD=titled No Money In This Deal, produced by Jack Starnes, one of th
EXTD=e original owners of Starday Records, whose partner was the regio
EXTD=nal jukebox owner Harold W. "Pappy" Daily. Jones was signed to St

EXTD=, 2009 \nBy  C. Jandreau (Kennebunk, Me]\n\nFor George Jones fans
EXTD=this set is a must have! Many of these tracks could only be foun
EXTD=d on vinyl but now the Bear Family has released them and remasted
EXTD=each track. The sound quality is excellent and the pictures /art
EXTD=work included with set are historic. Tracks such as "Time Lock" a
EXTD=nd "Papa's Wagon" were previously released only as re-issues, yet
EXTD=on this set they can be found in their original form. I am convi
EXTD=nced that the Bear Family makes the highest quality box sets. I'm
EXTD=looking forward to seeing the release of the work George did in 
EXTD=the 70's and 80's. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nMuddy Possum
EXTD=, June 15, 2009 \nBy  James L. Harris "hankfan" (Powhatan VA]\n\n
EXTD=About ten years ago I decided George Jones was the greatest vocal
EXTD=ist of the 20th century. I set out to find every commercially rel
EXTD=eased George Jones record. There were great compilations from the
EXTD=Mercury years, the United Artists years, and the Epic years. Str
EXTD=angely, the only Musicor stuff was available on budget CD's and c
EXTD=assettes. Even career-spanning retrospectives like Sony/Legacy's 
EXTD=2-CD best of and Rhino's 1-CD compilations only had 2 or 3 Musico
EXTD=r titles. Even George's "50 Years of Hits" compilation had zero M
EXTD=usicor titles. \n\nApparently, the notoriously eccentric Aubrey M
EXTD=ayhew owned the Musicor masters and wouldn't license them to anyo
EXTD=ne. He licensed his Starday and King holdings to everyone, but th
EXTD=e Musicor stuff was strangely held back, except for the budget-li
EXTD=ne CD's and cassettes usually found in non-traditional retail out
EXTD=lets like truck stops. \n\nI bought every single budget-line cass
EXTD=ette and CD and put them together on CDR's. I then started discov
EXTD=ering multitudes of Musicor LP's on ebay and other places and sta
EXTD=rted buying those, along with Mercury, Starday, Epic, and United 
EXTD=Artists LP's. \n\nWhy oh why wouldn't Bear Family or some other l
EXTD=abel do justice to George Jones' staggering body of work? Ernest 
EXTD=Tubb, Hank Snow, dozens of others have seen their entire catalogu
EXTD=es reissued by Bear Family and eased the minds (and wallets) of u
EXTD=s country music fanatics. Now I think I have answers to all of my
EXTD=questions. \n\nIt pains me to type type this, having purchased d
EXTD=ozens of Bear Family boxed sets and single disc sets, but the sou
EXTD=nd quality on this is awful. The latter half of the box sounds li
EXTD=ke they were transferring the songs from 7th or 8th generation ta
EXTD=pes that had been sitting in a leaky 300 degree attic. The high e
EXTD=nd on the tapes is gone - the low end is muddy, and the whole thi
EXTD=ng should have been left on the shelf. I'm guessing anyone that a
EXTD=pproached Mayhew or whomever had these tapes backed off when they
EXTD=heard what awful shape the masters were in. \n\nHad I been in Be
EXTD=ar Family's shoes, I might have searched high and low for clean c
EXTD=opies of the vinyl to reissue, as my LP's fidelity is heads and s
EXTD=houlders above the damaged tapes presented here. \n\nThat being s
EXTD=aid, the session information and discography presented within are
EXTD=invaluable. Roughly 40 per cent of the box does sound great, it'
EXTD=s the latter 60 per cent that has massive problems. I do question
EXTD=why they would hire Rich Kienzle to pen the liners, as he appare
EXTD=ntly hates the Musicor material and bad-mouths it throughout his 
EXTD=notes in this set (and elsewhere in his allmusic.com reviews). "H
EXTD=ey, thanks for buying this boxed set, too bad George Jones' Music
EXTD=or stuff sucks!" \n\nBuyer beware on this one - it would be worth
EXTD=your while to hunt down the original vinyl and burn your own box
EXTD=I was so excited when I saw this on Bear's release schedule - I
EXTD='ve been waiting for this for a decade. If you are in the mood fo
EXTD=r a George Jones Bear Box, I'd stick with "She Thinks I Still Car
EXTD=e," the United Artists years.
