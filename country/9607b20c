EXTD=RT REVIEW: It's arguable that no country singer ever came closer 
EXTD=to straight jazz than Robbins. Released in 1962, this album of mo
EXTD=stly jazz standards is somewhat of an anomaly in his catalog, jaz
EXTD=z being one of the few styles he would dabble in but never fully 
EXTD=embrace. It is part of his remarkably diverse late-'50s/early-'60
EXTD=s period, in which he recorded Hawaiian music, cowboy songs, honk
EXTD=y tonk, and pop covers, all within a five-year span. Robbins was 
EXTD=known to dive headlong into a style, and that's certainly true he
EXTD=re -- there's not a shred of country anywhere on this album, save
EXTD=for an ever-present Nashville chorus and a slightly rockabilly v
EXTD=ersion of "On the Sunny Side of the Street." It's not nearly as i
EXTD=nteresting, though, as Ray Price's Night Life, which utilizes the
EXTD=same smoky setting to better effect, and Robbins' take on these 
EXTD=songs isn't distinctive enough to be memorable, which is perhaps 
EXTD=the reason that most latter-day compilations have chosen to ignor
