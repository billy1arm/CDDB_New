EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: N/A\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\n(6-CD se
EXTD=t and 160 page book) The last word on the first name in western gro
EXTD=up harmony! The Sons Of The Pioneers weren't cowboys and weren t 
EXTD=even from the west, but they captured the awe and wonder of those
EXTD=who first rode the range... and they did it in a dramatically ne
EXTD=w way, inventing western harmony, including trio yodels. The orig
EXTD=inal Sons Of The Pioneers were an outstanding group in every way.
EXTD=The original group comprised Roy Rogers, Bob Nolan, and Tim Spen
EXTD=cer. All three were exceptional vocalists, and Nolan was a true p
EXTD=oet. Spencer and Rogers were also fine songwriters. When they add
EXTD=ed the swinging guitar and fiddle of Hugh and Karl Farr, their so
EXTD=und was complete. This 6-CD set includes all of their recordings 
EXTD=from 1934-1943, and among the classics from those early sessions 
EXTD=are the original versions of Way Out There, Tumbling Tumbleweeds,
EXTD=(Happy) Roving Cowboy, One More Ride, Empty Saddles, Cool Water,
EXTD=and So Long To The Red River Valley. This set also includes all 
EXTD=of Roy Rogers' earliest solo recordings from 1937 to 1942. In all
EXTD=, these six CDs include 182 songs, 52 of which are unissued takes
EXTD=or unissued recordings.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNot quite
EXTD=complete October 29, 2009\nBy DMC (Winter Park, FL, US]\nA more 
EXTD=appropriate name is "Complete except for the released versions of
EXTD=18 of their hits". The collection features alternate takes of ma
EXTD=ny songs, plus multiple obscure recordings by both SoP and Roy Ro
EXTD=gers. But for 18 of their hits, such as 'Roving cowboy', 'Ride Ra
EXTD=nger ride', 'Melody from the sky', the collection omits the versi
EXTD=ons that were released on 78. The collection also does not includ
EXTD=e square dance calls by Roy Rogers, for a total of 25 recordings 
EXTD=that are omitted. It can't be called "Complete". There's no expla
EXTD=nation for why these songs were omitted from the collection.\nOth
EXTD=er than that, the collection is up to Bear Family standards: an i
EXTD=n-depth collection, including obscure recordings - good sound qual
EXTD=ity, even after 70 years - a book with bio by Ranger Doug and lots
EXTD=of photos and film posters.\nEven if you purchase this, you'll s
EXTD=till need to purchase other CDs containing the released versions 
EXTD=of many recordings, and you'll have difficulty finding the Roy Ro
EXTD=gers square dance calls.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nLong Aw
EXTD=aited Release October 8, 2009\nBy Z. Stephen Long (Wichita, KS, U
EXTD=S]\nAs a lifetime fan of the Pioneers, I was waiting with bated b
EXTD=reath for the release of this compilation. It was a terrific unde
EXTD=rtaking I'm sure, and had the Bear Family not committed to it - I 
EXTD=feel certain no one else would have. There are many alternate tak
EXTD=es of Pioneer favorites, a few songs we've never heard them cover
EXTD=, and of course, the old familiar sides. The audio enhancement th
EXTD=at must have been done on these 70 year old sides is top notch - s
EXTD=urface noise is at a bare minimum. Still, with all these wonderfu
EXTD=l attributes, there is still a flaw. This was advertised as the "
EXTD=complete" recordings and it just isn't so. While I respectfully d
EXTD=isagree, at least in part, with the previous reviewer that the fa
EXTD=miliar sides aren't incorporated into this collection - there are 
EXTD=some unissued recordings that I was very much hoping would be inc
EXTD=luded that aren't. Bob Nolan's terrific song "I Still Do" was rec
EXTD=orded but never issued on March 7, 1935 - the Pioneers second reco
EXTD=rding session. "On A Mountain High" a song never recorded elsewhe
EXTD=re, unless on the Transcriptions done in the early '40's is anoth
EXTD=er one not found herein - as well as "Popeyed", possibly an instru
EXTD=mental. "The New Frontier", a Tim Spencer song was recorded at on
EXTD=e of the early sessions and never commercially released. So, it's
EXTD=a trifle dishonest to say that these recordings are "complete". 
EXTD=In defense of the Bear Family, those recordings may well be lost 
EXTD=never to be recovered. I know from the many other Box Sets in my 
EXTD=posession that they are very thorough. Perhaps one day the four m
EXTD=issing sides will turn up. Not to be a deterrent though. If you a
EXTD=re a Pioneers fan, this set is definitely a must. Hats off to the
EXTD=Bear Family for preserving our musical history and heritage!\n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNot Quite Complete October 2, 2009\nB
EXTD=y Willard Eisenhower (Washington, DC, US]\nTypically well-done Be
EXTD=ar Family boxed set. However, several unissued alternate takes (e
EXTD=g. Roving Cowboy, Over the Santa Fe Trail, Cajon Stomp, Melody f
EXTD=rom the Sky, Empty Saddles, I'm an Old Cowhand, etc.) are used in
EXTD=place of the released takes. When included in addition to releas
EXTD=ed takes, alternates are always interesting for comparison - but i
EXTD=f the released takes are omitted, are these really the "complete 
EXTD=original recordings" as advertised? The released takes are availa
EXTD=ble elsewhere, but technically this is not quite the "everything 
EXTD=in one place" that some might be looking for. Small quibble, perh
EXTD=aps, but a little disappointing after the long wait for these tra
EXTD=cks.\n\nAlso, since much of the Pioneers' story is contained in t
EXTD=he notes for the other SOP Bear Family sets (Wagon Wheels, Transc
EXTD=riptions), the hardcover book for this set consists mostly of col
EXTD=or reproductions of posters and one-sheets for the Pioneers' and 
EXTD=Roy Rogers movies. Good track-by-track notes by Ranger Doug of Ri
EXTD=ders in the Sky.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n"Way Out Ther
EXTD=e" is way out there!  October 26, 2009\nRobert G Oregon (Oregon, 
EXTD=US]\n"For an item I would have accepted in almost any quality, th
EXTD=is is absolutely incredible. Music of the Sons of the Pioneers of
EXTD=their earliest recordings, that are nearly impossible to locate,
EXTD=made available in this deluxe format was beyond my hopes. The so
EXTD=ngs are great and the remastering is top notch. Sure, some have m
EXTD=ild surface noise, but when you have to choose between over-clean
EXTD=ing the source material or giving the greatest fidelity, once aga
EXTD=in Bear Family takes the high road. The hard-bound book is everyt
EXTD=hing that you expect from Bear family. Fabulous pictures from the
EXTD=Movies and nice early publicity shots plus great info regarding 
EXTD=the "Sons" history and session information. Well worth the invest
EXTD=ment."
