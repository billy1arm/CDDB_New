EXTD=s comprising the title, Take Me to Your World/I Don't Wanna Play 
EXTD=House was a strong outing from Tammy Wynette, sensitively and spa
EXTD=rely produced by Billy Sherrill (who co-wrote those two hits and 
EXTD=one of the other better tracks, "Good"). Wynette is in good plain
EXTD=tive voice throughout the record, showing her interpretive skills
EXTD=to good effect on her version of Johnny Ray's "Cry," although th
EXTD=e reading of "Ode to Billie Joe" is too jaunty (especially when c
EXTD=ompared with Bobbie Gentry's magnificent original). "It's My Way,
EXTD=" with its sad melody, multi-tracked vocals, and spare steel guit

EXTD=lbum That Kick Started The Tammy Wynette Phenomenon, April 7, 200
EXTD=0\nReviewer: Joe Taylor (Fort Wayne]\nThis is the second (solo) a
EXTD=lbum released by the future "First Lady of Country Music". Her fi
EXTD=rst album (YOUR GOOD GIRLS GONNA GO BAD) had generated one top 40
EXTD=hit and then her first hit single (of the same name) but the alb
EXTD=um itself was practically ignored by country fans and radio. TAKE
EXTD=ME TO YOUR WORLD/I DONT WANNA PLAY HOUSE would change all that. 
EXTD=I DONT WANNA PLAY HOUSE was a MAJOR hit and would earn Tammy her 
EXTD=first Grammy award. Tammy and noted producer Billy Sherill offer 
EXTD=a variety of sounds in this album, which was said to be put toget
EXTD=her rather quickly in order to cash in on the popularity of the s
EXTD=ingle release. Their efforts would pay off and the album would be
EXTD=come a best seller. Of course, this was at a period in time when 
EXTD=no female vocalist in country music had ever sold a million copie
EXTD=s of an album. Tammy would do that in just a few years, with the 
EXTD=release of her greatest hits package. But until then, strong perf
EXTD=ormances and solid songs would become the foundation of a Sherill
EXTD=/Wynette production. Listen to the first songs of the first lady 
EXTD=and you will be able to rediscover that magic and musical time pe
EXTD=riod. Indeed, Tammy manages to takes US to HER world.\n
