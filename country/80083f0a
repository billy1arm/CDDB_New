EXTD=cluded in the excellent four-part Blues medley, which pays tribut
EXTD=e to some of Hank's heroes in that genre of music including Light

EXTD=ne song in which Hank really lets you know about life as he sees 
EXTD=it - and several such songs were later compiled together on Ameri
EXTD=ca the way I see it. On this album you get Mr Lincoln, in which H

EXTD=e adjustment sounds like it might be another soapbox song but thi

EXTD=courthouse blues is about what can happen to a man if he loves t

EXTD=and Country relaxing are all wonderful, as is the big hit of the
