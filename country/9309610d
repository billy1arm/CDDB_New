EXTD=PERT REVIEW: 1995's Train A-Comin' signaled Steve Earle's final de
EXTD=claration of independence from the Nashville assembly line.At last
EXTD=liberated from his personal demons, Earle found himself exiled fr
EXTD=om mainstream Nashville. So instead of releasing an albumdesigned 
EXTD=to appeal to honchos in Nashville or L.A., Earle released an album
EXTD=that appealed first and foremost to Earle. The resultwas a stupen
EXTD=dous album, a foreshadowing of the renaissance of his career. The 
EXTD=disc has the air of a "lost album" that somehow found it's way to 
EXTD=market. A crack band of Nashville string kings (Peter Rowan, Norma
EXTD=n Blake, and Roy Huskey Jr., with Emmylou Harrissinging harmony) t
EXTD=ears into quasi-legendary tunes that had been lying around Earle's
EXTD=repertoire, neglected for years. Earle's narrative genius is show
EXTD=cased on three numbers -- "The Mercenary Song," the Civil War ball
EXTD=ad "Ben McCulloch," and the classic outlaw tune "Tom Ames' Prayer,
EXTD=" all of which sound as if they were branded into leather rather t
EXTD=han written on paper. "Tom Ames' Prayer" especially takes the brea
EXTD=th away with its killer final stanza: "And then he cocked both his
EXTD=pistols/spit in the dirt/And walked outin the street." The album 
EXTD=is not all a history lesson, of course. The semi-autobiographical 
EXTD="South Nashville Blues" alarms with its deadpan musings from his s
EXTD=elf-described two-year "vacation inthe ghetto," while "Goodbye" ra
EXTD=nks with "My Old Friend the Blues"as one of his teariest weepers. 
EXTD=Train A-Comin' has proven to bejust that -- the locomotive that Ea
EXTD=rle drove through some dark tunnels, pulling behind it a boxcar or
EXTD=two of the finest music of his career. -- John LomaxAmazon.com 
EXTD=essential recordingSteveEarle's first record after emerging from 
EXTD=artistic struggles, prison, and addiction, 1995's Train A-Comin' f
EXTD=inds an artist starting from scratch and returning to the very bas
EXTD=ics of his musical vision. The low-key, charming, all-acoustic sup

EXTD=zza. The mix of covers--Beatles, Townes Van Zandt, and the "Jamaic
EXTD=an hillbilly" of"Rivers of Babylon" (with Emmylou Harris chiming i
EXTD=n)--proves hehad one primary listener in mind: himself. With no ex
EXTD=pectations thrust upon him, no labels involved, and very few at th

EXTD=000 Reviewer: juanlaprinci from RPV I only know Steve Earle thru
EXTD="The Mountain" and this album. To me, he is the world's greatest 
EXTD=folk and bluegrass musician...even though most of his albums are m
EXTD=ade with other instrumentation. I just see a guy who's loaded with
EXTD=talent and musical intent. He picks up a guitar, he opens his mout
EXTD=h, and what comes out is just perfect. The way this album starts u
EXTD=p..."Hear that train a comin', hear that train a comin'..." Nothin
EXTD=g could be simpler, and yet it comes out like the very spiritof mu
EXTD=sic. "The Mountain" deserves 6 stars. This one gets a 5. Great.

EXTD=my judgment, June 15, 1998 Reviewer: jim.kamp@gale.com from Detro
EXTD=it, Michigan "Train-a-comin" was the album that got me back into 
EXTD=Steve Earle after buying his Hillbilly Highway back in the 80s. Un
EXTD=til "Train", I had lost interest in Earle, thinking he was a flash
EXTD=in the pan. Now that I'm back into his music,I realize nothing co
EXTD=uld be further from the truth. "Train" is oneof those rare wall-to
EXTD=wall solid recordings that never disappoints and usually inspires
EXTD=sing-along in the car. I think it's a perfect record. After "Trai
EXTD=n," I've picked up on Earle's other 90s offereings, and I have fou
EXTD=nd them to be excellent as well. His latest, "El Corazon" is parti
EXTD=cularly good. But the one that made itall work for me is "Train". 
EXTD=For an all-acoustic album, it's wonderfully diverse, with nice aco
EXTD=ustic blendings, harmonies, and soulful thumpings. For me, this al
EXTD=bum is an access point into one ofthe most amazing singer/songwrit
EXTD=ing talents of our time. Amazon.com Customer ReviewA Warm And P
EXTD=ersonal Album, April 2, 2001Reviewer: Steve Vrana from Aurora, NE
EXTD=USA Steve Earl opens the album by declaring: "This here's the 'H
EXTD=ometown Blues' with apologies to Thomas Wolfe and Doc Watson," and
EXTD=then presents the listener with the warmest and perhaps most pers
EXTD=onal album of this country renegade's career. It had been four yea
EXTD=rs since his last studio album, 1991's The Hard Way, and almost a 
EXTD=decade since his 1986 debut Guitar Town. For this comeback effort,
EXTD=Earle strips things down to the roots. The band consists of a Who
EXTD='s Who of country,folk and bluegrass musicians: Norman Blake (guit
EXTD=ar, Dobro, fiddle, mandolin and Hawaiian guitar), Peter Rowan (man
EXTD=dolin, mandola,gut string guitar and vocals), Roy Husky (accoustic
EXTD=bass) and Emmylou Harris (vocals). The album is a mixture of orig
EXTD=inals like "Mercenary Song" and "Ben McCulloch," and covers like T
EXTD=ownes Van Zandt's "Tecumseh Valley" and a wonderful version of the
EXTD=Beatles'"I'm Looking Through You." If you enjoyed Earle's 1999 co
EXTD=llaberation with the Del McCoury Band on The Mountain, you'll love
EXTD=Traina Comin'. In 1986 three artists released their debuts: Dwigh
EXTD=t Yoakam, Randy Travis and Steve Earle. I thought they would save 
EXTD=country music. If they haven't succeeded, they at least have helpe

EXTD=ReviewJust whenwe needed it, hoot, there it wuz, July 30, 1999 
EXTD=Reviewer: A music fan from way over yonder I read the current pre
EXTD=ss commentaryabout Steve Earle, seems they've all 'discovered' the
EXTD=boy thesedays. Every danged one wants to tell us about Steve's 'b
EXTD=ad habits' and his return from the hoosegow, full of musical vim a
EXTD=nd vigor. Then some will try to tell you his 1996 release 'I Feel 
EXTD=Alright' was what got him back on the road to whatever. Them newsh
EXTD=awks need to pay a little more attention. 1995's "Train A-Comin" w
EXTD=as Steve's first post-hoosegow hightoned yowl, and it's still my f
EXTD=avorite. Some of his best work is sprinkled around on this album, 
EXTD='Sometimes She Forgets' done here the way it oughta be done (ignor
EXTD=eanything you heard released out of Nashville). It echoes the them
EXTD=e of the haunting 'Tecumsah Valley',a legacy of the immortal Towne
EXTD=s Van Zandt, Steve's friend and mentor. Musicians and backup vocal
EXTD=s are top notch, not just good, maestro's. No more than needed,and
EXTD=doing what they do better'n anyone. We're talking Norman Blake he
EXTD=re, and Emmy Lou in fine fettle. Back before those newshawkswere p
EXTD=aying attention, Steve hit the ground running in '95. What's more,
EXTD=just when he needed to let his pent-up music loose, hisold fans n
EXTD=eeded to hear it. So if you were dozin', showed up late, or carry 
EXTD=a presspass and need a fact-checker...don't miss thatTrain. She's 
EXTD=a high bindin' juggernaut, and she'll ride you all the way on over

EXTD=time, this was Earle's "comeback album." Not only is it an unfilt
EXTD=ered pleasure to hear Earle in such pared-down environs, butthe ba

EXTD=ate Roy Huskey don't make "guest appearances" with the band-they a

EXTD=even given a solo spot, the guitar instrumental "Northern Winds." 
EXTD=Earle draws on material written over the last 20 years, but ther
EXTD=e's never a sense that he's culling from his notebook material tha
