EXTD=Released September 26, 2006 \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: It may be hard to beli
EXTD=eve, but it's true: Legacy's four-disc 2006 box Nashville Rebel is the fi
EXTD=rst comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembl
EXTD=ed. During the peak of the CD box set reissue boom of the late '80s/early
EXTD='90s, Waylon did receive a quasi-box in the form of 1993's Only Daddy Th
EXTD=at'll Walk the Line: The RCA Years, an excellent double-disc set that was
EXTD=housed in a box yet fell short of being a true box set. Starting in the 
EXTD=late '90s, his catalog began to be overhauled -- Buddha reissued classic 
EXTD=individual albums like Honky Tonk Heroes, Bear Family put out two huge bo
EXTD=x sets that chronicled all of his RCA work up until 1973, then the rest o
EXTD=f his '70s work came out as two-fers overseas, while Hip-O assembled a co
EXTD=llection of both his earliest recordings and his '80s work for MCA -- but
EXTD=he still lacked a set that covered his whole career, from 1958 through 1
EXTD=995. That's exactly what Nashville Rebel does, and it does so in superb f
EXTD=ashion. Any career with as much great work as Waylon's is inevitably hard
EXTD=to condense, even at the length of a four-disc set with 92 tracks, but N
EXTD=ashville Rebel does the job right, providing an accurate, compelling narr
EXTD=ative of Jennings' career, while offering all of his biggest hits along w
EXTD=ith sharply chosen lesser-known songs and rarities that help complete the
EXTD=picture. Any hardcore fan might find favorite songs missing, but nobody 
EXTD=can complain about what's here -- and that applies not only to the first 
EXTD=three discs, which trace the prime of Waylon's career, but even the fourt
EXTD=h, which is the rare final CD on a multi-disc set that is solid, perhaps 
EXTD=not as gripping or timeless as the music that precedes it, but it does pr
EXTD=esent a convincing case that Waylon continued to make strong music right 
EXTD=up until the later stages of his career. And this is how Nashville Rebel 
EXTD=is like those classic box sets of the late '80s and early '90s: there is 
EXTD=no fluff, no needlessly chosen rarities - it simply and cleanly gives the 
EXTD=listener the essential items from a truly great artist. There is plenty o
EXTD=f other great music within Waylon's catalog, but if this is all somebody 
EXTD=heard from him, they would know exactly who he was and what he meant musi
EXTD=cally. That's the goal of all lavish box sets such as this, and this is o
EXTD=ne of the few that truly achieves that goal. It's an essential item, not 
EXTD=just for country fans, but for anybody who cares about American music of 
EXTD=the 20th century. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Revi
EXTD=ew\nThough the late Waylon Jennings has had numerous greatest-hits compil
EXTD=ations, this four-disc box that encompasses almost half a century of musi
EXTD=c making is his first comprehensive, career-spanning anthology. While the
EXTD=1970s and early '80s were plainly Jennings's commercial and creative hey
EXTD=day--when the Outlaw movement christened by his recording of "Ladies Love
EXTD=Outlaws" was in full swagger--highlights here extend from his 1958 reviv
EXTD=al of the Cajun classic "Jolie Blon" (produced by Jennings's mentor Buddy
EXTD=Holly) through his swan-song recordings with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash,
EXTD=and Kris Kristofferson as the Highwaymen. The trademark lope of Jennings
EXTD='s music and his penchant for self-mythologizing material give him a stro
EXTD=ng signature sound, but the anthology shows just how much musical territo
EXTD=ry he covered--from his folkish reading of Gordon Lightfoot's "(That's Wh
EXTD=at You Get) For Lovin' Me" and his bluesy transformation of Little Richar
EXTD=d's "Lucille" through his dips into the songbooks of Neil Young ("Are You
EXTD=Ready for the Country"), Jimmy Webb ("MacArthur Park"), and Los Lobos ("
EXTD=Will the Wolf Survive?"). The 140-page booklet provides thorough credits 
EXTD=and annotation, as well as an abundance of photos of Waylon with friends,
EXTD=fellow musicians, and every famous person he ever met (from Muhammad Ali
EXTD=to Metallica's James Hetfield). --Don McLeese \n\nAmazon.com Product Des

EXTD=ny-BMG has finally given American country fans a comprehensive, thoroughl
EXTD=y satisfying -- and affordable! -- overview of Waylon Jennings' entire ca
EXTD=reer. From his early years singing in bars in the Southwest through his e
EXTD=ntry into (and swift departure from) the Nashville establishment, on into
EXTD=his "outlaw" golden years, this captures Waylon at his best. \n\nDisc On
EXTD=e, which concentrates on Jennings' early years as a 1960s "folk-country" 
EXTD=singer in Nashville, probably has the most to offer fans who are already 
EXTD=familiar with his big, rowdy hits of the '70s and early '80s. Although th
EXTD=e folk-oriented material isn't as rugged or meaty as his later work, ther
EXTD=e are some soulful performances and unusual arrangements and production t
EXTD=ouches that may surprise even longtime fans. The disc is well-chosen and 
EXTD=nicely paced, and packed with plenty of non-hit material that may be unfa
EXTD=miliar even to devoted Waylon fans. Discs Two and Three comprehensively d
EXTD=ocument his glory years, all those fearless, funny, sad, soulful hits tha
EXTD=t stand at the very core of the outlaw/alternative country canon. Yeah, t
EXTD=here are some songs left out, but not many, and all the major touchstones
EXTD=are included. The last disc skims his work in the 1980s and '90s, with t
EXTD=he added bonus that his work for the rival MCA label is also sampled, mak
EXTD=ing room for some of his later hits and one-off material. \n\nThere are a
EXTD=lot of good Waylon best-of collections on the market today, but this rea
EXTD=lly blows most of them away. We could all think of some additional songs 
EXTD=we'd like to see on here as well, but for anyone who just wants to get a 
EXTD=really, really good introduction to Waylon's work, this collection oughtt
EXTD=a do it for you.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nWaylon Done It His Way, O
EXTD=ctober 30, 2006\nReviewer: Jim Newsom (Norfolk, VA]\nWaylon Jennings had 
EXTD=one of the quintessential country music voices, a deep baritone audibly i
EXTD=mbued with the hardscrabble upbringing of a child of itinerant farmhands 
EXTD=who grew up to become a hard-headed, hard-boiled singer of songs on his o
EXTD=wn terms. \n\nJennings embodied the "outlaw" movement that reinvigorated 
EXTD=country music in the 1970s. But his music career stretched back to the be
EXTD=ginnings of rock-n-roll, when he was a disc jockey in Lubbock, Texas, who
EXTD=befriended rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Holly produced his first recording,
EXTD=a strange cover of the Cajun tune, "Jole Blon" that featured King Curtis
EXTD=on doo-wop saxophone. That single flopped, but Jennings was assured of b
EXTD=eing at least a footnote in the music history books even if he never reco
EXTD=rded again: \n\nAfter breaking up his band, the Crickets, Holly recruited
EXTD=Jennings to play electric bass with him on the "Winter Dance Party Tour"
EXTD=of 1959. When the heater on the tour bus stopped working, Holly chartere
EXTD=d a plane for himself and his band to fly from a show in Clear Lake, Iowa
EXTD=, to the next night's performance in Moorhead, Minnesota. But Jennings ga
EXTD=ve up his seat on the plane to J. P. Richardson, aka "the Big Bopper," be
EXTD=cause Richardson had come down with the flu. Just before the plane took o
EXTD=ff, Holly joked to Jennings, "Well, I hope your old tour bus freezes up."
EXTD=Jennings good naturedly replied, "I hope your darn ol' plane crashes!" \n
EXTD=\nAnd that's just what happened on February 3, 1959, "the day the music d
EXTD=ied." His final words to his good friend would haunt Waylon Jennings for 
EXTD=years, and that eerie feeling that he was supposed to have been on the do
EXTD=omed plane would trouble him for the rest of his life. \n\nNonetheless, c
EXTD=ountry music stardom was in his future, and his first hit came in 1965 wi
EXTD=th the Buck Owens-like, "Stop the World (and Let Me Off)." The next year 
EXTD=he reached the country Top Ten with a semi-rockabilly ride through Gordon
EXTD=Lightfoot's "(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me," and he flirted with t
EXTD=he upper reaches of the country charts for the next five years with a ser
EXTD=ies of singles cranked out in the efficient factory-like production style
EXTD=of the then-dominant "Nashville Sound." \n\nBut he was chomping at the b
EXTD=it, eager to make records on his own terms. His frustration peaked about 
EXTD=the same time he learned of the record industry's indulgent treatment of 
EXTD=rock musicians and in 1972, he successfully renegotiated his contract wit
EXTD=h RCA, freeing himself from the heavy hand of corporate Nashville and gai
EXTD=ning control over his own recorded output. With his pal, Willie Nelson, a
EXTD=nd other free-thinking artists like Johnny Cash, Tompall Glaser, Kris Kri
EXTD=stofferson and Hank Williams, Jr., he plotted a new direction and inspire
EXTD=d a movement that took its name from his recording of "Ladies Love Outlaw
EXTD=s" and was cemented with the compilation album, Wanted! The Outlaws, the 
EXTD=first platinum-selling country album ever. \n\nBy the mid-'70s, Waylon Je
EXTD=nnings was one of the true superstars of country music, crossing over to 
EXTD=appeal to rockers as well with songs like "I'm a Ramblin' Man," "Are You 
EXTD=Sure Hank Done It This Way" and "Good Hearted Woman." He closed out the d
EXTD=ecade with a string of chart toppers including "Luckenbach, Texas (Back t
EXTD=o the Basics of Love)," "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowbo
EXTD=ys," "I Ain't Living Long Like This," and the theme from the TV show, The
EXTD=Dukes of Hazzard. \n\nNashville Rebel is a four-disc set that collects 9
EXTD=2 songs from throughout Jennings' career, opening with that Buddy Holly c
EXTD=ollaboration and continuing with late '60s hits like "The Only Daddy That
EXTD='ll Walk the Line," through the "Outlaw" period on into the "Highwayman" 
EXTD=projects with Nelson, Cash and Kristofferson and concluding with a couple
EXTD=of latter day outings including his final Top Ten tune, "Wrong," a multi
EXTD=cultural blend of marimba and dobro from 1990. \n\nAlong the way there a
EXTD=re several duets with Willie, a few with wife Jessi Colter, and some surp
EXTD=rises--you'd think "MacArthur Park" would be a ridiculous choice for a co
EXTD=untry singer, but Jennings actually gives his six-and-a-half minute "MacA
EXTD=rthur Park (Revisited)" a depth not even hinted at in Richard Harris' pop
EXTD=hit version. \n\nThe box set takes its title from a low-budget American 
EXTD=International straight-to-drive-in movie from 1966 in which Jennings play
EXTD=s a musician with "a guitar in his hand...a gal on his arm and a talent f
EXTD=or trouble with his fists." Ironically, he would become a much more serio
EXTD=us kind of Nashville Rebel, paving the way for a union of hippie rockers 
EXTD=and country traditionalists that shook up the arbiters on both sides of t
EXTD=he divide. \n\nWhile contemporary country has embraced the rock elements 
EXTD=ol' Waylon brought into it in spades, the factory system is now as strong
EXTD=as it's ever been. But this box set reminds us that once upon a time, th
EXTD=ere was a man who took on Nashville's entrenched powers and triumphed by 
EXTD=doing it his way. \n\ncopyright © 2006 Port Folio Weekly. Used by Permiss
