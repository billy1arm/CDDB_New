EXTD=© 1996 Bear Family Records\n\nUPC: 4000127159045\nCat Number: BCD
EXTD=15904 LK\n\nOriginally Released 1996\nReissued January 2, 2007\n
EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  It's 12 CDs, 321 tracks, and lists for over
EXTD=$300, but for those with the budget or the discipline to save up
EXTD=for it, this box set is it -- not only every record that Hank Th
EXTD=ompson cut for Capitol between 1947 and 1964, but also his ultra-
EXTD=rare, never-before-reissued sides for Globe and Blue Bonnet from 
EXTD=1946 and 1947. Disc One opens with those early jewels -- there's 
EXTD=not a less-than-first-rate recording on this 30-song CD, and the 
EXTD=playing, while a little crude compared to Thompson's later work, 
EXTD=is a match for anything being recorded at the time. Disc Three be
EXTD=gins Thompson's history as an album artist, and the character and
EXTD=quality of the material changes somewhat -- there are a few more
EXTD=slow numbers, and some slight sameness begins to intrude into th
EXTD=e music, but the quality of the performances is undiminished. Dis
EXTD=c Four has the major part of his second album along with a ton of
EXTD=singles, and the latter are generally more brisk and upbeat than
EXTD=the LP material. Disc Five includes the first extensive re-recor
EXTD=ds of Thompson's older stuff, and also includes Thompson's brief 
EXTD=foray into rock and roll, as well as lots of Western swing standard
EXTD=s. Disc Seven opens real hot, with the stuff off of Songs for Rou
EXTD=nders, and a bunch of instrumentals that round out the 1958 mater
EXTD=ial, then jumps ahead a year to his next session. Discs Nine and 
EXTD=Ten jump ahead a bit to Thompson's last studio work for Capitol, 
EXTD=released through 1965. Discs Eleven and Twelve are devoted to Tho
EXTD=mpson's live albums from the early 1960s. And to top it off, this
EXTD=set comes with an oversized hardcover book, featuring not only a
EXTD=biography and sessionography, but recollections by Thompson abou
EXTD=t every recording session.  -- Bruce Eder \n\n\nAmazon.com Editor
EXTD=ial Review: This 12-CD set includes all of Thompson's 1946-47 Glo
EXTD=be and Bluebonnet recordings, as well as his complete 1947-1964 C
EXTD=apitol recorded output. Included are all three of his live LPs in
EXTD=cluding the 1961 Hank Thompson At The Golden Nugget', the first l
EXTD=ive LP ever done by a solo country singer.
