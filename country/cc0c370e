EXTD=afide hit, I don't see where that argument stands. Womack is very deserving of putting out a greatest hits set, and I'm sure there are more to come, based on the positive reception of her new album. \n\nPick this up if you'd like a retrospective of a

EXTD=A music fan\nThe country songs on here are great. Her first two albums were awesome, traditional, country masterpieces.\nThen, she changed her image with "I Hope You Dance", got rid of the twang and the country, and went for a pop sound and a sleazy,

EXTD=002's Cry) where her focus on glamour and torch songs was seen as turning her back on country audiences for the wider success of American pop radio. A more extreme example is Shania Twain's "Up!!!" album in which the listener is given two CDs with th
EXTD=e very same songs on each. The difference between the two CDs is that on one Twain's vocal track is backed up by country instrumentation and the other she is backed up by more customary "pop" instrumentation. This only underlined the suspicions of ma

EXTD=smoother, almost "little girl" voice. We also note the presence of heavy orchestration behind Womack. Worst of all is the most "un-country" like indulgence in saccharine sweet preachiness that tries to pass itself off as "older but wiser" wisdom. "As
