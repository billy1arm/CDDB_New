EXTD=f ABKCO's series of box sets containing CD replicas of the Rollin
EXTD=g Stones' original singles for Decca and London during the '60s s
EXTD=eems not quite as impressive as the first two, there's a reason f
EXTD=or it: it's not. But that has little to do with either the music 
EXTD=- some of the Stones' very best is here, including "Street Fight
EXTD=ing Man," "Honky Tonk Women," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash," all viabl
EXTD=e contenders for the greatest rock and roll single ever -- or the p
EXTD=ackaging, which is every bit as lavish and loving as the first tw
EXTD=o installments. Instead, the problem is that the nine singles col
EXTD=lected here are a bit of a hodgepodge. The aforementioned trio ar
EXTD=e the group's last singles of the '60s, with the latter two being
EXTD=the last two singles the band conceived as stand-alone 45s. Afte
EXTD=r that, there were two singles pulled from the 1971 album Sticky 
EXTD=Fingers -- "Brown Sugar" and "Wild Horses," both backed by album 
EXTD=tracks (the former had a live version of Chuck Berry's "Let It Ro
EXTD=ck" on a U.K. pressing, but that's not available here) -- and tha
EXTD=t LP is more commonly associated with the Stones' '70s albums for
EXTD=their own label, not their '60s work, so even if historically th
EXTD=ey were part of the London years, they don't quite feel like the 
EXTD=end of this chapter - rather, they feel like the beginning of the 
EXTD=next. That accounts for half of Singles 1968-1971. The remaining 
EXTD=five discs contain Mick Jagger's excellent solo single of "Memo f
EXTD=rom Turner" from the film Performance, two singles from the 1975 
EXTD='60s rarities compilation Metamorphosis ("I Don't Know Why"/"Jivi
EXTD=ng Sister Fanny" and "I Don't Know Why"/"Try a Little Harder"), t
EXTD=he "Sympathy for the Devil" single -- which was released in the U
EXTD=K. in 1976, but is presented in its 2003 form containing contemp
EXTD=orary dance remixes by the Neptunes and Fatboy Slim, variations t
EXTD=hat are, needless to say, rather incongruous in this setting -- a
EXTD=nd, finally, a welcome bonus DVD containing the Stones playing "T
EXTD=ime Is On My Side" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, a live versio
EXTD=n of "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?" f
EXTD=rom 1967, and the classic promo video for "Jumpin' Jack Flash" fr
EXTD=om 1968, as well as an out-of-place 2003 video for the Neptunes' 
EXTD=remix of "Sympathy for the Devil." While all these odds and ends 
EXTD=are nice to have, since they tie up any loose ends from this era,
EXTD=the end result doesn't have the narrative flow or the rarities o
EXTD=f the previous installments. That said, Singles 1968-1971 is a wo
EXTD=nderful set for collectors, and it retains the high standard of t
EXTD=he rest of the series.   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nHalf.com

EXTD=andsome box sets, SINGLES 1968-1971 is yet another must-have for 
EXTD=hardcore Rolling Stones fans. As with the earlier installments, t
EXTD=he collection presents the original 45's in CD format, along with
EXTD=a booklet of informative liner notes, vintage photos, and promot
EXTD=ional artwork.\n\nAlthough the "Jumpin' Jack Flash" B-side, "Chil
EXTD=d of the Moon," finds the Stones still attempting to keep pace wi
EXTD=th the Beatles (the song clearly echoes Lennon/McCartney's "Rain"
EXTD=), the aforementioned A-side presents the group living up to thei
EXTD=r reputation as the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band with blazin
EXTD=g abandon. Given Brian Jones's 1969 death and his subsequent repl
EXTD=acement by a young Mick Taylor, the era was clearly a transitiona
EXTD=l period for the Stones, and the music reflects this, most notabl
EXTD=y in the country twang of "Honky Tonk Women" and the wistful "Wil
EXTD=d Horses." A particular treat for Jagger fans is the inclusion of
EXTD=his strutting "Memo from Turner" single, taken from the film PER
EXTD=FORMANCE, along with the Ry Cooder instrumental "Natural Magic." 
EXTD=The set also includes a "Sympathy for the Devil" single updated w

EXTD=W\n"The London Years" Compared To The 3 "Singles" Box Sets, June 
EXTD=12, 2006 \nBy  Mark Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nThe purpose of
EXTD=this review is to completely compare the contents of "Singles Co
EXTD=llection: The London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets which as 
EXTD=a group contain the same songs plus more. There are some good com
EXTD=parisons in the other reviews, but also several omissions and ina
EXTD=ccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear things 
EXTD=up a bit as to what songs are included on each, and which "missin
EXTD=g" songs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, particularly 
EXTD="More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these collect
EXTD=ions is rather expensive, so hopefully this may help you decide w
EXTD=hich sets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thing first 
EXTD=though, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP contained i
EXTD=n the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the full le
EXTD=ngth CD "Got Live If You Want It". They share the same title but 
EXTD=that's all, and were actually two different releases. Buying the 
EXTD=full length CD will NOT get you all the same songs on the EP as i
EXTD=ndicated in another review. With that out of the way..... \n\n"Si
EXTD=ngles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains
EXTD=all of the songs included in this box set, with the exception of
EXTD=3 original British EP's exclusive to the box set. The first EP c
EXTD=ontains You Better Move On (also available on "December's Childre
EXTD=n") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 also available 
EXTD=on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The second EP (or
EXTD=iginally titled "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 21
EXTD=20 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around and Aroun
EXTD=d, all of which are also available on the "12 X 5" CD. The third 
EXTD=EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contains early
EXTD=live versions of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Somebody To
EXTD=Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alright, no
EXTD=ne of which are available on any other CD (with the possible exce
EXTD=ption of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same version inc
EXTD=luded on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusion: Both 
EXTD="The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early single/B
EXTD=sides Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as well as I 
EXTD=Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren't avail
EXTD=able on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs not incl
EXTD=uded elsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP. So the dec
EXTD=iding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" would
EXTD=appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "Singles Coll
EXTD=ection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in t
EXTD=his 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Both contain the single/B-si
EXTD=des Long Long While and We Love You (also available on "More Hot Ro
EXTD=cks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which aren't availa
EXTD=ble on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs not inclu
EXTD=ded elsewhere. No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1968-1971": "
EXTD=Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs i
EXTD=ncluded in this 3rd box set, with a few unique exceptions. The th
EXTD=ird box set additionally contains Everybody Needs Somebody to Lov
EXTD=e (also available on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and three non-ABK
EXTD=CO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-sides are 
EXTD=the Ry Cooder instrumental Natural Magic (from the film "Performa
EXTD=nce" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bitch and Sw
EXTD=ay which were the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. My guess 
EXTD=is the licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin Records
EXTD=, etc. and hadn't yet been negotiated when "The London Years" was
EXTD=originally released back in 1989. The remixes appear to be 3 dif
EXTD=ferent "rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The box set
EXTD=also contains a bonus DVD (see the item description for more on 
EXTD=that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71
EXTD=" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on "More H
EXTD=ot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available on "Hot 
EXTD=Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between "The London Years" and 
EXTD="Singles 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-sides, t
EXTD=he three remixes and the DVD contained in the box set. \n\nFinal 
EXTD=Conclusion: For the completest collector who has to have absolute
EXTD=ly everything on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Buy all 3 box 
EXTD=sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and the two b
EXTD=ox sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of duplication, 
EXTD=though "The London Years" runs a little cheaper than the box sets
EXTD=+ you don't have to change CD's as often). \n\nA slightly cheape
EXTD=r option if you're mainly interested in completing the ABKCO Roll
EXTD=ing Stones "canon" not released on the regular studio full-length
EXTD=CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and "Singl
EXTD=es 1963-1965". You'd only be missing the three non-ABKCO B-sides 
EXTD=and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper option st
EXTD=ill, if you're only interested in the very early singles and live E
EXTD=P and can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to buy "More
EXTD=Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1965". Wi
EXTD=th those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Your Plan
EXTD=e? and the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\nIn trut
EXTD=h, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London Years" 
EXTD=make an interesting listen because each is primarily made up of A
EXTD=and B sides not included on the regular studio CD's. So they're al
EXTD=most like listening to independent CD's without repeating too man
EXTD=y songs you'll hear when listening to the other albums. The 2nd d
EXTD=isc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkly (Big 
EXTD=Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with different selections of song
EXTD=s, so comparing these two further is highly recommended as well. 
EXTD=\n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTO

EXTD=in 1971 and originally released in the UK as the B side to Brown
