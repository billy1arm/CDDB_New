EXTT0=**Behind Closed Doors**\nMy baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud \nShe never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd\n'Cause people like to talk, Lord, how they love to talk\nBut when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be 
EXTT0=leaving with me\n\n[Chorus:]\nAnd when we get behind closed doors\nThen she lets her hair hang down\nAnd she makes me glad I'm a man\nOh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.\nMy, behind closed doors.\n\nMy baby makes me smile, Lord don't 
EXTT0=she make me smile\nShe's never too far away or too tired to say "I want you"\nShe's always a lady, just like a lady should be\nBut when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me.\n\n[Chorus]

EXTT1=now what to do if \nyou weren't here to stay\n\nTake away the gentle summer breeze\nTake away the golden autumn leaves\nI can live without blue skies above\nBut I could never live without your love.\nYou give me life you make bad times turn into \n
EXTT1=those good times You give me love Lord above knows .\n\nI wouldn't know what to do if you wouldn't be my\nlady I wouldn't know what to do if you weren't\nhere today I wouldn't know what to do if you \nwouldn't be my lady I wouldn't know what to do
