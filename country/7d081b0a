EXTD=an" (Leicester England]\nThe Judds became major country stars as 
EXTD=a result of their previous album, Why not me, which yielded four 
EXTD=number one country hits (although one of them had already appeare
EXTD=d on their debut min-LP). So - how did they follow that? The answ
EXTD=er is - with this album, which yielded a further four number one 
EXTD=country hits. The overall sound is different with the backing mus
EXTD=ic much more restrained. The result is a smoother but sparser alb
EXTD=um than Why not me. This album therefore relies much more heavily
EXTD=on the voices of Wynonna and Naomi, which are of course excellen
EXTD=t. Of the two, I prefer Why not me but I can understand why a lot
EXTD=of people prefer this album. The songs are of an equal standard.
EXTD=\nThe four big hits here are the title track, Have mercy, Grandpa
EXTD=tell me about the good old days and Cry myself to sleep. You've 
EXTD=probably heard most or all of these tracks but there is much to l
EXTD=ike about the other six tracks here. Those tracks include a cover
EXTD=of Allen Toussaint's Working in the coalmine (originally a pop h
EXTD=it for Lee Dorsey). If I were you, Tears for you, River roll on, 
EXTD=I wish she wouldn't treat you that way and Dream chaser are all w
EXTD=onderful songs.\n\nTraditional country fans looking for a relaxin

EXTD=can't be totally "disinterested" here, becaue I've had a crush o
EXTD=n her since about '85 - but - ugh - Naomi looks like those ***s g

EXTD=efore Naomi got sick. And it's been mentioned (a LOT) of places e
EXTD=lsewhere, but about this time, I got fed up with what was conside
EXTD=red "popular music," Rock And Roll having died with E in 1977. DR
EXTD=EADFUL time, folks - but Country was going thru one of its all to

EXTD=ike Dwight and Clint. And the seventh song on the album, "Cry Mys

EXTD=put down my treasured Presision Bass and pick up my ancient Epip
EXTD=hone-something acoustic. And I began frequenting "Open Mike" nigh
EXTD=ts whereever, and was very gratified whenever I'd find a Lady who
EXTD=sing Wynonna's part, and let me sing Naomi and play my acoustic.
EXTD=Rambling, yes, but this album/CD - WOW: "Have Mercy" "Grandpa" "
EXTD=Workin In The Coal Mine" (God Bless Don Potter for the beautiful 
EXTD=guitar he played for them!) - but as I said, "Cry Myself To Sleep
EXTD=" has since become one of my equals with treasures such as "Gimme
EXTD=Shelter," "Once Bitten Twice Shy," "In My Life," "Whiter Shade O
EXTD=f Pale," "Dock Of The Bay" - I guess you get the message. The ult
