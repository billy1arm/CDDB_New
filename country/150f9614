EXTD=Essential Marty Robbins highlights 40 remastered tracks recorded

EXTD=ajor paths Robbins' 30-year-career took. Starting with his first

EXTD=ay Conniff Orchestra, the package wraps up with his final Top Ten
EXTD=country single from 1982, "Honkytonk Man." Ample space is given

EXTD=ral Billy Sherrill-produced singles in the mid-'70s. While these 
EXTD=discs contain a wealth of Robbins material from which to choose, 
EXTD=Essential only hints at the singer's ability to easily grasp and

EXTD=Amazon.com Customer Review\nVERY GOOD...BUT NOT PERFECT, July 6, 
EXTD=2005 \nReviewer: S. SMITH "ROCKINGROLL" (COLONY 9, PLUTO]\nThis i
EXTD=s a nice way to get most of Marty's highlights throughout his car
EXTD=eer at a relatively cheap price. The problem with this compilatio
EXTD=n and the others is that they leave off far too many Top 10 Country
EXTD=hits. For example, where's "It's Your World"? That single went t
EXTD=o #3, and it even went to #51 on the Pop charts, yet it's curious
EXTD=ly absent here. There are also several Top 100 Pop hits missing. 
EXTD=Maybe the folks putting these collections together should look at
EXTD=Joel Whitburn's books now and again! My feeling is that if you'r
EXTD=e doing an "essential" collection by a country artist, you should
EXTD=include at least all of their Top 10 Country hits and Top 40 Pop h
EXTD=its. Is that too much to ask? I guess it is. Anyway...this is act
EXTD=ually a pretty decent set if you enjoy Mr. Robbins' work but don'
EXTD=t really care if it's missing some chart hits. But for a completi
EXTD=st like me, it's somewhat frustrating. I just hope that some day 
EXTD=Sony will get on the ball and do a 4-cd box set with all of his h
EXTD=its and some nice rarities. \n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nPersonnel inc
