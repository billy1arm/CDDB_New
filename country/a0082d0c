EXTD=ville/Legacy\n\nOriginally Released April 21, 1973\nRemastered and 
EXTD=Expanded CD Edition Released April 3, 2007\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: 
EXTD=At some point, after a successful career and a comeback or two, 
EXTD=certain singer/writers like Dolly Parton become artists above and
EXTD=beyond criticism. If her past work in pop and country hadn't acc
EXTD=omplished this for her, her recent string of roots albums on Suga
EXTD=r Hill certified her status as a senior statesperson of American 
EXTD=music. Interestingly, reaching this exalted position also has a r
EXTD=etroactive effect, bestowing the word "classic" on one's earlier 
EXTD=work. My Tennessee Mountain Home was originally released in 1973,
EXTD=and unlike 1971's Coat of Many Colors, it follows a theme and fe
EXTD=els like a real album. After reading a letter she wrote home in 1
EXTD=964 after she'd first arrived in Nashville, Parton sets the tone 
EXTD=of the album with "I Remember": My Tennessee Mountain Home will s
EXTD=erve as a memory theater, recalling and lifting up the ideal of a
EXTD=modest, simple life in the country. This simplicity is evoked in
EXTD=small everyday details, like the "Old Black Kettle" and "Daddy's
EXTD=Working Boots," while the underlying values of hard work, God, a
EXTD=nd family are declared over and over. While one would never call 
EXTD=Parton or most '70s country artists postmodernists, the music her
EXTD=e is very self-conscious of its rural roots and how the principle
EXTD=s it sets forth are both different and at odds with the outside w
EXTD=orld. Parton has written all the material, and producer Bob Fergu
EXTD=son has done a much better job integrating songs and arrangements
EXTD=than on the previous Coat of Many Colors. And while there are a 
EXTD=number of impure additions -- cheesy background singing being the
EXTD=most annoying -- acoustic guitars and Dobros play a prominent ro
EXTD=le. The 2007 reissue of My Tennessee Mountain Home is skimpy on b
EXTD=onus material. The sole extra, "Sacred Memories," was originally 
EXTD=issued on Love Is Like a Butterfly, and even with this one additi
EXTD=on, the album is not quite 35 minutes long. Still, the album qual
EXTD=ifies as classic Dolly Parton, and it's nice to have it on CD.  -
EXTD=Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. \n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  My Tennessee Mo
EXTD=untain Home is one of the rootsiest records of Dolly Parton's car
EXTD=eer. With its affectionate homages and salutes to her childhood i
EXTD=n Tennessee, the record is a direct and moving slice of mountain 
EXTD=music that isn't dressed up in cosmopolitan production. Parton wr
EXTD=ote every song on the record, creating a loose, musical autobiogr
EXTD=aphy with its 11 songs. Though the sound of the record isn't part
EXTD=icularly rowdy, it is heartfelt and rootsy and Parton's songs -- 
EXTD="Old Black Kettle," "The Letter," "The Good Old Days When Times W
EXTD=ere Bad," and "The Better Part of Life" -- are among her best, mo
EXTD=st affecting songs, much like My Tennessee Mountain Home itself.

EXTD=her Dolly Gem!", April 8, 2007 \nBy  Terry Richard "Terry Richard
EXTD=" (New Brunswick, Canada]\nOriginally a poor seller when it was f
EXTD=irst released in 1973, but crtically acclaimed, "My Tennessee Mou
EXTD=ntain Home" has through the years become one of the best Dolly al
EXTD=bums ever. This marks the first North American release of the CD.
EXTD=It's amazing and comes with the original album being repackaged 
EXTD=with the liner notes and photos and comes with the bonus track "S
EXTD=acred Memories" that was dropped from the album and later added t
EXTD=o Dolly's 1974 LP "Love is Like A Butterfly". There are also some
EXTD=rare photos from 1970 that were taken during the recording of Do
EXTD=lly's "A Real Live Dolly" LP. A must for any true country fan and
EXTD=Dolly fan. One of the best Parton compositions "Down on Music Ro
EXTD=w" is included here as well. Chet Flippo also has added some new 
EXTD=liner notes. A perfect CD! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSubd
EXTD=ued album looks home from Nashville, April 4, 2007 \nBy  redtunic
EXTD=troll (Earth, USA]\nThis 1973 entry in Parton's catalog has previ
EXTD=ously been available as part of an import two-fer (winningly pair
EXTD=ed with the following year's "Jolene"), but this is the first dom
EXTD=estic reissue. Parton was a star on the Porter Wagoner show in th
EXTD=e early '70s, but solo recognition was arriving more grudgingly. 
EXTD=Her chafing under Wagoner's contractual control didn't help, and 
EXTD=her songwriting exhibited a streak of homesickness, starting with
EXTD=the spoken word opener on this LP. \n\nParton sings lovingly of 
EXTD=her parents ("I Remember" "Daddy's Working Boots"), home ("Old Bl
EXTD=ack Kettle" "My Tennessee Mountain Home" "Back Home"), and remark
EXTD=able neighbors ("Dr. Robert F. Thomas" - the man who brought Part
EXTD=on into this world). The album's homespun sounds form a bookend w
EXTD=ith 1998's "Hungry Again," particularly in the traditional, acous
EXTD=tic backings. The album's title track is a perfect example of Par
EXTD=ton's craft, evoking images so real that you can feel yourself lo
EXTD=nging for a return to Smoky Mountains you may never before have v
EXTD=isited. \n\nThe remainder of the album failed to catch on the cha
EXTD=rts, but Parton's nostalgic and wistful songs are quite charming.
EXTD=The story of her arrival in Nashville, "Down on Music Row," is a
EXTD=a great example (along with the title track and career standouts
EXTD=like "Coat of Many Colors") of how Parton could turn her persona
EXTD=l history into memorable, engaging songs. The lone bonus track on
EXTD=this reissue, "Sacred Memories," was recorded during the album's
EXTD=sessions, issued as a B-side, and reappeared on the LP "Love is 
EXTD=Like a Butterfly." \n\nLegacy's reissue (along with accompanying 
EXTD=versions of "Jolene" and "Coat of Many Colors") fills out the pac
EXTD=kaging with newly struck liner notes by Chet Flippo and chart and
EXTD=session information. Aside from the title track, this is a more 
EXTD=subdued and subtle entry in Parton's catalog and its lack of prev
EXTD=ious domestic reissue leaves it fresh to many fan's ears. Most of
EXTD=Parton's albums of this era are essential, and this one's no exc

EXTD=CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDolly's first masterpiece, April 4, 2007 \nBy  
EXTD=Allen Chapman (STAFFORD SPRINGS, CT USA]\nThis album has been iss
EXTD=ued on CD only once before as an import. But for the first time w
EXTD=e have it here in the States. This album is a concept album about
EXTD=Dolly's childhood growing up in the sticks of Tennessee. On the 
EXTD=surface the album would seem to be a little too self indulgent, b
EXTD=ut the concept works very well. The album is like looking thru a 
EXTD=photo album with Dolly from her birth up to her getting her first
EXTD=record deal. For an artist who at the time hadn't really hit hug
EXTD=e, at least not like she would for another four years, this album
EXTD=was a gamble, A gamble that pays off. It's a great country album
EXTD=Only one bonus track included with this one, which makes sense 
EXTD=since it is a concept album. The track "Sacred Memories" was reco
EXTD=rded during the same sessions as this album but released on a lat
EXTD=er album. \n\n\nHalf.com Details \nProducer: Bob Ferguson, Tom Pi
