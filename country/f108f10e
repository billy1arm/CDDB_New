EXTD=ed April 3, 2007\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  At some point, after a su
EXTD=ccessful career and a comeback or two, certain singer/writers lik
EXTD=e Dolly Parton become artists above and beyond criticism. If her 
EXTD=past work in pop and country hadn't accomplished this for her, he
EXTD=r recent string of roots albums on Sugar Hill certified her statu
EXTD=s as a senior statesperson of American music. Interestingly, reac
EXTD=hing this exalted position also has a retroactive effect, bestowi
EXTD=ng the word "classic" on one's earlier work. Coat of Many Colors 
EXTD=was first issued in 1971, and the now famous title cut has remain
EXTD=ed one of Parton's best love songs. The album's arrangements are 
EXTD=all over the map, and it sounds, unlike 1973's My Tennessee Mount
EXTD=ain Home, as though she had recorded a handful of singles and the
EXTD=n added filler. Parton's voice and the subject matter of her most
EXTD=ly self-penned songs defined her as a country singer, in spite of
EXTD=dissimilar arrangements. While none of the material is bad, litt
EXTD=le holds up to "Coat of Many Colors" and the rocking "Traveling M
EXTD=an," the first and second cuts on the album. The bonus material a
EXTD=dds little to the package save the very special last cut, an acou
EXTD=stic demo of "My Blue Tears" (the album cut was a hit -- number 1
EXTD=7 -- in 1971). This cut brings to mind the adage about demos some
EXTD=times being more interesting than the actual release. With only P
EXTD=arton and her acoustic guitar, the song has an organic, natural f
EXTD=eel that roots fans would call authentic. Arguably, the cut has m
EXTD=ore authenticity than her later recordings on Sugar Hill, and it 
EXTD=is frightening to imagine that recordings like this, deemed too b
EXTD=asic for public consumption, remain locked in the vault. Not only
EXTD=is the demo of "My Blue Tears" more interesting than the album t
EXTD=rack, it leads one to believe that the entire album would have be
EXTD=en better off without Nashville touches like cheesy background si
EXTD=ngers. Coat of Many Colors is still a good snapshot of Parton as 
EXTD=her career really started to pick up steam.  -- Ronnie D. Lankfor
EXTD=d, Jr.\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Dolly Parton had a number of hits
EXTD=in the late '60s as Porter Wagoner's duet partner, yet solo succ
EXTD=ess eluded her until her 1971 album Coat of Many Colors. The titl
EXTD=e track was a Top Ten single, and it effectively became her signa
EXTD=ture song, largely because it was a sweetly autobiographical tune
EXTD=about her childhood. That song, along with its two hit predecess
EXTD=ors, "Traveling Man" and "My Blue Tears," were evidence that Part
EXTD=on was a strong songwriter, but the full album reveals the true d
EXTD=epth of her talents. She wrote seven of the ten songs (Wagoner wr
EXTD=ote the other three), none of which is filler. There isn't really
EXTD=a theme behind Coat of Many Colors, even if its title track sugg
EXTD=ests otherwise. Instead, it's a remarkably consistent album, in t
EXTD=erms of songwriting and performances, but also remarkably diverse
EXTD=, revealing that Dolly can handle ballads, country-rockers, tearj
EXTD=erkers, and country-pop with equal aplomb. And while it is very s
EXTD=hort, clocking in at under a half-hour, there isn't a wasted mome
EXTD=nt on the album. It's a lean, trim album that impresses because o
EXTD=f succinctness -- with its ten songs, it announced Parton as a ma
EXTD=jor talent in her own right, not merely a duet partner.  -- Steph

EXTD=mure but astonishingly innovative songwriter who comprised the fe
EXTD=male part of country music's most famous pair on "The Porter Wago
EXTD=ner Show." Today these dual roles seem hard to reconcile, but Par
EXTD=ton has played them masterfully for decades. Not only that, it se
EXTD=ems incomprehensible that she ever held a mere supporting role, a
EXTD=s she did to Wagoner, but her excellent 1971 album "Coat of Many 
EXTD=Colors" helped her to finally burst out on her own when 1974 arri
EXTD=ved. \n\nWay back in 1971, Parton's career was on the upswing. By
EXTD=this time she had already released numerous albums stretching al
EXTD=l the way back to 1963. A greatest hits album, sans Wagoner, appe
EXTD=ared in 1970 along with her first number one country hit, "Joshua
EXTD=" Parton, probably feeling a little dizzy at the peak of fame an
EXTD=d groping for footing, turned to her childhood for inspiration. S
EXTD=he swears that the story depicted in "Coat of Many Colors" actual
EXTD=ly happened. The miniscule handwriting included in the CD booklet
EXTD=, made somewhat illegible by today's coaster-sized packaging, tel
EXTD=ls the entire story - Parton signed the tale with flourishes as f
EXTD=ull as her celebrity bosom. Bouncing along with a steady unwaveri
EXTD=ng rhythm, the song itself has become a country standard. Parton'
EXTD=s voice remains solemnly subdued throughout, almost in reverence 
EXTD=or awe of the pride instilled in the patchwork coat her mother ma
EXTD=de her. The song also finds a source of pride in family, regardle
EXTD=ss of poverty: "And oh I couldnt understand it - For I felt I was
EXTD=rich - And I told them of the love - My momma sewed in every sti
EXTD=tch" and "One is only poor only if they choose to be." \n\nUnfort
EXTD=unately, mother turns a little evil in the second song, "Travelin
EXTD=g Man." Here "mama" runs off with the "traveling man" that her da
EXTD=ughter had dibs on. Parton plays the shafted offspring bemoaning 
EXTD="Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that - You just like my daddy
EXTD=He run off before I ever knowed him - You done run-off with my
EXTD=traveling man - And I really don't think I ever knowed you eithe
EXTD=r." "Traveling Man" adds a new dimension to country music's "chea
EXTD=tin'" theme: this time the cheater is the accuser's own mother! D
EXTD=efiant strings and a driving honky tonk beat give this #20 hit a 
EXTD=humorous, playful tone. \n\nThe beautiful and folksy "My Blue Tea
EXTD=rs" mourns lost love. Parton's voice appropriately flutters upwar
EXTD=d on the second "fly." This song revels in bluegrass instrumentat
EXTD=ion and riffs. It could fit on any of Parton's most recent releas
EXTD=es in which she comes full circle back to her musical roots. \n\n
EXTD="Coat of Many Colors" also harbors some shocking scenes for 1971.
EXTD="If I Lose My Mind" deals with abuse and with what then passed a
EXTD=s perversion. Mother becomes good again. Less jarring, "The Way I
EXTD=See You" subtly explores the sensual side of love. In "She Never
EXTD=Met a Man (She Didn't Like)" a woman tries to convince her lover
EXTD=that he's fallen for a promiscuous flirt. Mixed with these amoro
EXTD=us tragedies are philosophical musings, "The Mystery of the Myste
EXTD=ry," a paen to nature, "Early Morning Breeze," and a call for wor
EXTD=ld peace, "A Better Place to Live." "Here I am" boldly pronounces
EXTD=steadfast love and commitment to another. Parton sings it as if 
EXTD=she realizes that she's finally come into her own. She was right.
EXTD="Coat of Many Colors" remains her most praised and acclaimed alb
EXTD=um. Rolling Stone even declared it number 299 on its list of "500
EXTD=Greatest Albums Ever." \n\nParton's personal touch and soaring v
EXTD=ocals, the themes the album explores, and the poingant story from
EXTD=her youth make this album a timeless country music classic. Anyo
EXTD=ne with doubts about Dolly Paton should spin this disc and perhap
EXTD=s reevaluate the dual but complementary personas she created that
EXTD=have boosted her to the level of American pop culture icon. Here
EXTD=she is, indeed. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n1972 Country M

EXTD=cover. The title song, despite only charting in the back of the t

EXTD=oods (this song was another hit for Dolly the following year in a
EXTD=new version with a sassier, more comic production that is admitt
EXTD=edly superior to the rather straight reading here in both Dolly's
EXTD=vocals and the track's production). Another hit for Dolly, albei
EXTD=t not a major one, was the lovely MY BLUE TEARS, sung Skeeter Dav
EXTD=is-style in double-track harmony. \n\nThe conservative crowd char
EXTD=med by the old-fashioned values in the title song probably got th
EXTD=rough for a major loop with IF I LOSE MY MIND, one of the most ri
EXTD=sque songs ever in country music in which Dolly escapes the clutc
EXTD=hes of a husband into kinky sex ("He made me watch him make love 
EXTD=to another woman and tried to make me love another man.") And yea
EXTD=rs before she went pop, Dolly's HERE I AM was clearly an attempt 
EXTD=to have the country queen sing soul music with an arrangement mor
EXTD=e at home on a typical Aretha Franklin album than a Tammy Wynette
EXTD=one. \n\nThis album earned Dolly a CMA nomination for ALBUM OF T
EXTD=HE YEAR in 1972. There are very few country albums from the era n
EXTD=ow available on CD in exact reproductions today. That alone shoul

EXTD=W\nStraight From the Heart, September 7, 2000 \nBy  Steven Slayto
EXTD=n (Plaquemine, La USA]\nTo sum up this Dolly album only takes one
EXTD=word--- WOW! The beginning tune is an autobiography of her life 
EXTD=in the haunting "Coat of Many Colors" which rivals Loretta's "Coa
EXTD=l Miner's Daughter." Of all of the songs Dolly's written, this is
EXTD=still her favorite. The second is Traveling Man-- this version i
EXTD=s far superior than the other version released as a single for th
EXTD=e Bubbling Over album. It is much more laid back and fun. My Blue
EXTD=Tears is another strong song on the album. As you go down the al
EXTD=bum, you are greeted by such great tunes as "If I Lose My Mind" a
EXTD=nd "The Mystery of the Mystery." The second half of the album beg
EXTD=ins with "She Never Met a Man She Didn't Like" which is rather li
EXTD=ght-hearted and fun. Then she hits you with "Early Morning Breeze
EXTD=" which would later be re-recorded for her Jolene album. But this
EXTD=version is far superior than the second version of the song. My 
EXTD=two favorite tracks are next with "The Way I See You" and "Here I
EXTD=Am." I can't help but singing along to those two songs. It close
EXTD=s with "A Better Place to Live." There is really no weak link on 
EXTD=this album. Many have said that Dolly is just a singles' artist a
EXTD=nd not an albums' artist, but one listen at this album can prove 
EXTD=all the critics wrong.... WOW!!! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW

EXTD=buy themselves some duplication. \n\nParton's early years under 
EXTD=the tutelage of Porter Wagoner were rich in material and performa
EXTD=nces, and "Coat of Many Colors" contains some of her best. The ti
EXTD=tle track weaves biography, bible verse and gospel soul into one 
EXTD=of Parton's most heart-rending compositions. Her words capture th
EXTD=e emotional turmoil of childhood through the discovery of an adul

EXTD=writing, singing and production mesh so fully. \n\nThe unrivaled 
EXTD=quality of Parton's voice is heard on the bluegrass-harmony backe
EXTD=d "My Blue Tears" and the forthright "She Never Met a Man (She Di
EXTD=dn't Like)." Parton's sassy comedic edge, which would carry her i
EXTD=nto the mainstream, is heard on "Traveling Man," and the outré "I
EXTD=f I Lose My Mind" must have shocked a few country listeners in 19
EXTD=71. The backings include fiddle, steel, twangy guitar, funky swam
EXTD=p beats and even a touch of '70s soul, and it's a testament to Pa
EXTD=rton's artistic gravity that it meshes so well into an album. \n\n
EXTD=The reissue's four bonus tracks include three cast-offs from the 
EXTD=original 1971 sessions, and the a superb acoustic demo of "My Blu
EXTD=e Tears." Parton rerecorded her own "My Heart Started Breaking" f
EXTD=or her 1975 "Dolly" LP, but this 1971 version's never been heard 
EXTD=before. Her "Just as Good as Gone" was left to the songbook, and 
EXTD=her rendition of Porter Wagoner's "The Tender Touch of Love" now 
EXTD=joins the previously released edition by Jim Ed Brown. All three

EXTD=standouts. Written primarily by Parton herself (with three songs 
EXTD=by Porter Wagoner, the mentor she was beginning to overshadow), C
