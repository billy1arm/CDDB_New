EXTD=2006\nReviewer: Reviewer (USA]\nThough a tad uneven at times, th

EXTD=Poco could be. The acoustic "Keep on Tryin" features Poco's harmo

EXTD=lie steel and clean lead guitar riffs is excellent. TIM'S FLYIN' 
EXTD=SOLO is good, but I do not understand why RUSTY does not play ped
EXTD=al steel guitar or anything on this song. The STEELY DAN written 
EXTD=DALLAS that is sung by PAUL is excellent with the harmony vocals,
EXTD=the orchestra, the pedal steel guitar riffs, the drums, and the
