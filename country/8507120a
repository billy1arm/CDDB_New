EXTD=and "I Don't Have Any More Love Songs" is one of the finer divor

EXTD=emorse and regret, not bitterness or clever one-upmanship. It's h
EXTD=onest, true, and painful. Williams is not one to wallow and his d
EXTD=isappointments come right back with a slash-and-burn cover of the
EXTD=nugget "White Lightnin'," most closely associated with George "T
EXTD=humper" Jones. And before allowing all that good-time fun to go t
EXTD=o waste, Williams and band weigh in with one of his most notoriou
EXTD=s macho outlaw tomes, "Women I've Never Had." It's sexist as hell
EXTD=, and Hank wanted it that way. It's an in-your-face to political 
EXTD=correctness and feminism. The set cooks up to here and after, and
EXTD=the title track feels out of place on the album, though it is ex
EXTD=ceptionally well-crafted as a song. It's easy to see why he compl
EXTD=ained later that it wasn't a single, though he is out of his mind
EXTD=for doing so. "OD'd in Denver" is its own dark reward and the ba
EXTD=nd digs into the groove deep and greasy. The album closes with th
EXTD=ree covers, the most notable and soulful of which is Gregg Allman
EXTD='s "Come and Go Blues," which is not played by the band so much a
