EXTD=rdings 1969-1976. This picks up where The Untamed Hawk left off, 
EXTD=which is more of a musical dividing point than it initially seems
EXTD=If The Untamed Hawk caught Haggard as he was reaching full flig
EXTD=ht, Hag captures him in his prime, as every single he released re
EXTD=ached the Country Top Ten -- often capturing the number one slot 
EXTD=- and as he sometimes crossed over into the pop Top 40. Hag was 
EXTD=without a doubt the biggest star in country music but the remarka
EXTD=ble thing about his reign at the top was that he never played it 
EXTD=safe. During this eight-year span, he recorded few songs as iconi
EXTD=c as "Strangers," "Swinging Doors," "The Bottle Let Me Down" or "
EXTD=Mama Tried," but a notable exception was "Okie from Muskogee" and
EXTD=its ornery cousin, "The Fighting Side of Me." Both were reaction
EXTD=ary rhetoric in the midst of the Vietnam war, but where the latte
EXTD=r was itching for a brawl -- a perfect pairing for its tough, twa
EXTD=ngy, Bakersfield sound -- "Okie" was gentler in its music and swe
EXTD=etly nostalgic in its tone, romanticizing an America that may nev
EXTD=er have been there.\nAs Hag makes clear, "Okie" provides the keys
EXTD=tone for the last half of Haggard's Capitol recordings, as his mu
EXTD=sic mellowed and deepened, and he turned toward painting a pictur
EXTD=e of his ideal America, knowing full well that the good times may
EXTD=already be over. The music feels different than that on Untamed 
EXTD=Hawk -- it's not as lean and tense, not as indebted to Buck. It's
EXTD=warmer yet more adventurous and far-ranging, at once referencing
EXTD=the past but sounding progressive, sounding smoother, but never 
EXTD=turning pop. Haggard's writing also underwent a subtle evolution,
EXTD=as he developed a narrative eye that had songs like "Tulare Dust
EXTD=" and "The Seashores of Old Mexico" play like short stories. With
EXTD=their spare, vivid lyrical detail, these songs created a mythic 
EXTD=image of America that the music matched with its blend of country
EXTD=, folk, blues, and jazz, so thoroughly integrated it was often im
EXTD=possible to discern where the styles began...unless it was on the
EXTD=genre exercises that Hag and the Strangers tore into with thrill
EXTD=ing abandon. Merle wrote a bunch of these himself, notably the sp
EXTD=ectacular Western swing of "Living with the Shades Pulled Down" a
EXTD=nd "Old Man from the Mountain," songs that illustrated his debt t
EXTD=o Lefty Frizzell and Bob Wills. It's possible to hear the influen
EXTD=ce of his idols here but all of Hag's full-length tributes, such 
EXTD=as his timeless Wills and Jimmie Rodgers salutes, aren't here -- 
EXTD=they, along with the Strangers albums, are bundled on a third Bea
EXTD=r Family box, out in 2008 -- but his knack for finding great mate
EXTD=rial is wholly evident, whether he's cutting his old friend Tommy
EXTD=Collins' "Carolyn" or cherry-picking Dolly Parton's "Kentucky Ga
EXTD=mbler."\nMuch of this variety can be heard on the many, many indi
EXTD=vidual albums Haggard released during the first half of the '70s 
EXTD=- most of the best of which have been reissued on CD, including 
EXTD=great two-fers from both Capitol and BGO -- but hearing it all in
EXTD=this six CD box, the depth and consistency of his music is stunn
EXTD=ing. Perhaps there are no revelations here aside from the politic

EXTD=eep, grumbling voice and his guitar work gives his country voice 
EXTD=a blues-like quality in many cuts. Emerging from prison in the 19
EXTD=60s, having broken out 17 different times, Haggard was one of the

EXTD=riods in 20th-century American history. Though the singer's appea
EXTD=l during this polarized time was superficially conservative, as e
EXTD=videnced by songs such as "Okie From Muskogee" and "The Fightin' 
EXTD=Side of Me," he was actually a rugged individualist in the true c

EXTD=le Haggard occupies a unique place in American music. The man who

EXTD=990s, and 2000s, and still works 200 sold-out road dates a year.\n
EXTD=\nEver since Bear Family released 'Untamed Hawk' in 1995, we've b
EXTD=een asked for a follow-up comprising the rest of his legendary Ca
EXTD=pitol recordings. This is it... on 6 CDs, and it covers the tumul
EXTD=tuous years between 1968 and 1976. The only exclusions are his Ji
EXTD=mmie Rodgers tribute (already issued on a single CD by Bear Famil
EXTD=y) and the live recordings, which will be released in a companion
EXTD=volume. \n\nThese were the years when Merle Haggard polarized th
EXTD=e USA with songs like Okie From Muskogee and The Fightin' Side Of
EXTD=Me, yet, as this set reveals, his approach to politics was more 
EXTD=nuanced than many thought at the time. In an unreleased song (one
EXTD=of many) titled Somewhere In Between he says "I stand looking at
EXTD=the left wing, and I turn towards the right, and my eyes find bo
EXTD=th good and bad there on either scene ...." He adds, I'm not too 
EXTD=old to understand the young who disagree."  The unissued recordin
EXTD=gs also include his original version of That's The Way Love Goes,
EXTD=which became a big hit for him on Epic Records several years lat
EXTD=er.\n\nThese were Merle Haggard's golden years when he gave voice
EXTD=to the voiceless, and scored an unbroken string of #1 hits. This
EXTD=is American country music...  make that American music...  at it
EXTD=s finest.
