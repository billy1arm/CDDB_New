EXTD=The Pathway of My Life: 1966-1986, Scott B. Bomar quotes somethin
EXTD=g Hank Thompson told his biographer, Warren Kice: "I was never ha
EXTD=ppy with those records and I never thought it was my thing. Nobod
EXTD=y wanted to do my style of music and I never was able to get the 
EXTD=records with Dot that I did with Capitol." Presumably, Thompson h
EXTD=eld the records he made for Warner Bros., ABC, and Churchill -- t
EXTD=he other three labels he recorded for after leaving Capitol in 19
EXTD=64 -- in a similar low regard and, to an extent, his mild disdain
EXTD=is understandable. The Capitol records he made with his Brazos V
EXTD=alley Boys between 1947 and 1965 -- boxed up, along with his hand
EXTD=ful of sides for Globe and Blue Bonnet, in Bear Family's 12-disc 
EXTD=1996 box Hank Thompson and His Brazos Valley Boys -- were indeed th
EXTD=e singer's popular and creative peak, monumental Western swing th
EXTD=at rivaled Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. The 20 years of musi
EXTD=c collected on The Pathway of My Life sees Thompson constantly ad
EXTD=justing to the times, first by trimming his group, which reached 
EXTD=14 musicians at its peak, to a core five or six, then allowing pr
EXTD=oducer Joe Allison to sweeten his Western swing with syrupy backi
EXTD=ng vocals -- a questionable idea made distasteful by the decision
EXTD=to have the singers mimic steel guitar lines. Allison added thes
EXTD=e sugary vocals with the intent of polishing Thompson up for the 
EXTD=changing pop charts and it worked, with "On Tap in the Can or in 
EXTD=the Bottle" and "Smoky the Bar" reaching the Top Ten in 1968. Ben
EXTD=eath that gloss -- and it's possible to hear around these tacky a
EXTD=ccouterments, as the whittled-down band remains muscular and is s
EXTD=ometimes accentuated by guitarist Merle Travis -- this music is h
EXTD=ard Texas country and, once he parted ways with Allison and moved
EXTD=from Warner to ABC, the purity of his country could easily be he
EXTD=ard. At times, he'd follow the shifting tides of fashion -- it's 
EXTD=disarming to hear fuzz guitars on the Allison-era "But That's All
EXTD=Right" but natural to hear him sing "Behind Closed Doors" -- and
EXTD=sometimes he'd indulge in a bout of nostalgia (he recorded a nic
EXTD=e tribute to the Mills Brothers in the early '70s, and it's fun t
EXTD=o hear him reconnect to his big-band roots), but he generally stu
EXTD=ck to his tried-and-true Texas country. His last Top Ten was call
EXTD=ed "The Older the Violin, the Sweeter the Music," a nod to his ad
EXTD=vancing age, and if the productions of the late '70s and early '8
EXTD=0s do sound a little brittle and cheap, the same can't be said of
EXTD=Thompson himself: as this big box proves, he was a warm, robust,
EXTD=cheerful vocalist who made sweet music.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlew
EXTD=ine\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review: \n(8-CD LP-sized box and 124 
EXTD=page hardcover book) This second Bear Family box set of Hank Thom
EXTD=pson's studio recordings picks up where the previous collection e
EXTD=nded and includes all his post-Capitol recordings for Warner Bros
EXTD=, Dot, ABC, Churchill, and MCA/Dot during the twenty year period
EXTD=from 1966 through 1986. It was an era when Hank would experiment
EXTD=with new sounds while repeatedly returning to the unparalleled b
EXTD=rand of honky-tonk infused western swing that made him a legend.\n
EXTD=\nIf one were to completely ignore the achievements of his classi
EXTD=c years on Capitol Records and only consider his career from 1966
EXTD=onward, Hank Thompson would still be regarded as a major country
EXTD=music success story. He placed twelve LPs on the country album c
EXTD=hart during this era, including three in the top 20. Additionally
EXTD=, he racked up thirty charting singles, including the top 20 hits

EXTD=To Heaven Open.\n\nThis 8-CD collection features all the hits, al
EXTD=ong with every album track, and dozens of rarities and overlooked
EXTD=gems that have never been available on CD before now. Included a
EXTD=re complete theme albums such as Hank's tributes to The Mills Bro
EXTD=thers and Nat 'King' Cole, as well as his album of songs about Ok
