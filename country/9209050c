EXTT0=John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor\nHe travelled with a gun in every hand\nAll along this country side he opened many a door\nBut he was never known to hurt an honest man\n\nTwas down in Chaney County, a time they talk about\nWith his lady
EXTT0=by his side he took a stand\nAnd soon the situation there was all but straightened out\nFor he was always known to lend a helping hand\n\nAll across the telegraph his name it did resound\nBut no charge held against him could be proved\nAnd there wa
EXTT0=s no man around that could track or chain him down\nHe was never known to make a foolish move
EXTT1=As I went out one morning to breathe the air aound Tom Paine's\nI spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains\nI offered her my hand, she took me by the arm\nI knew that very instant she meant to do me harm\n\n"Part from me this momeent." 
EXTT1=I told her with my voice\nSaid she, "But I don't wish to. " Said I "But you have no choice."\n"I beg you sir", she pleaded from the corners of her mouth\n"I will secretly accept you, and together we'll fly south."\n\nJust then Tom Paine himself came
EXTT1=running from across the field\nShouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield\nAnd, as she was letting go her grip of Tom Paine, did run\n"I'm sorry sir", he said to me.  "I'm sorry for what she's done."
EXTT2=I dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive as you or me\nTearing through these quarters in the utmost misery\nWith a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold\nSearching for the very souls whom already have been sold\n\n"Arise, arise", he cried s
EXTT2=o loud with a voice without restraint\n"Come out you gifted kings and queens and hear my sad complaint"\n"No martyr is among ye now whom ye can call your own"\n"But go on your way accordingly but know you're not alone"\n\nI dreamed I saw St. Augusti
EXTT2=ne alive with fiery breath\nAnd I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death\nOh I awoke in anger so alone and terrified\nI put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried
EXTT3="There must be some way out of here,"\nsaid the joker to the thief,\n"There's too much confusion,\nI can't get no relief\nBusinessmen they drink my wine,\nplowmen dig my earth\nNone of them along the line\n know what any of it is worth"\n\n"No reaso
EXTT3=n to get excited,"\nthe thief, he kindly spoke\n"There are many here among us\nwho feel that life is but a joke\nBut you and I, we've been through that\nand this is not our fate\nSo let us not talk falsely now, \nthe hour is getting late"\n\nAll alo
EXTT3=ng the watchtower\nPrinces kept the view\nWhile all the women came and went\nBarefoot servants, too\n\nOutside in the distance\nA wild cat did growl\nTwo riders were approaching\nThe wind began to howl
EXTT4=Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.\nSo, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens,\nAnd placed them on a foot stool just above the clouded plain.\nSaying, "Take your pick, Frankie 
EXTT4=boy.  My loss will be your gain."\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin.\nBut with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.\n"Could you please not stare at me like that", he said. "It's just my foolish pr
EXTT4=ide.\nFor sometimes a man must be alone, and this is no place to hide."\nWell Judas he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here,\nBut you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."\n"I'm goin' t
EXTT4=o start my pickin' right now.  Just tell me where you'll be."\nJudas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."\n"Eternity?", said Frankie Lee, with a voice as cold as ice.\n"That's right," said Judas "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
EXTT4=\n"I don't call it anything", said Frankie Lee with a smile.\n"Alright", said Judas Priest "I'll see you after a while."\nWell Frankie Lee he sat back down feeling low and mean.\nWhen just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene.\nSaying, "Are 
EXTT4=you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?\nFor, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road, and they say his name is Priest."\n"Oh yes, he is my friend", said Frankie Lee in fright.\n"I do recall him very well.  In fact, he
EXTT4=just left my sight."\n"Yes that's the one", said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.\n"Oh my message is, he's down the road, stranded in a house."\nWell, Frankie Lee, he panicked.  He dropped everything and ran\nUntil he came on to the spot where Ju
EXTT4=das Priest did stand.\n"What kind of house is this?", he said "Where I have come to roam."\n"It's not a house", says Judas Priest, "It's not a house, it's a home."\nWell, Frankie Lee, he trembled.  He soon lost all control\nOver everything which he 
EXTT4=had made while the mission bells did toll.\nHe just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun\nWith four and twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.\nWell, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful bounding leap.EXTT4=\nA
EXTT4=nd, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.\nFor sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst\nInto the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst\nNo one tried to say a thing, when they carried hi
EXTT4=m out, in jest\nExcept, of course, the little neighbor boy who carried him to rest\nAnd he just walked along alone with his guilt so well concealed\nAnd muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."\n\nWell the moral of this story, the mora
EXTT4=l of this song\nIs simply that one should never be where one does not belong.\nSo, when you see your neighbor carrying somethin', help him with his load.\nAnd don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
EXTT5="Oh, help me in my weakness", I heard the drifter say\nAs they carried him from the court room and were taking him away.\n"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time it isn't long\nAnd I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."\n\nWe
EXTT5=ll, the judge he cast his robe aside a tear came to his eye\n"You failed to understand", he said.  "Why must you even try?"\nOutside the crowd was stirring, you could hear if from the door\nInside the judge was stepping down, while the jury cried fo
EXTT5=r more.\n\n"Oh, stop that, cursed jury", cried the attendant and the nurse\n"The trial was bad enough, but his is ten times worse,"\nJust then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape\nAnd while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did
EXTT5=escape.
EXTT6=Dear landlord, please don't put a price on my soul\nMy burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control\nWhen that steamboat whistle blows\nI'm gonna to give you all that I got to give\nAnd I do hope you receive it well\nDepending on the way you feel t
EXTT6=hat you lived.\n\nDear landlord, please heed these words that I speak\nI know you suffered much, but in this you are not so unique\nAll of us at times, we might work too hard\nTo have it too fast and too much\nAnd anyone can fill his live up with th
EXTT6=ings\nHe can see but it just cannot touch.\n\nDear landlord, please don't dismiss my case\nI'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place\nNow each of us has his own special gift\nAnd you know this was meant to be true\nAnd if you d
EXTT6=on't under estimate me\nI won't under estimate you.
EXTT7=I am a lonesome hobo\nWithout family or friends.\nWhere another man's life might begin\nThat's exactly where mine ends.\nI have tried my hand at bribery,\nBlackmail and deceit.\nAnd I've served time for everything\n'cept beggin' on the street.\n\nWe
EXTT7=ll, once I was rather prosperous\nThere was nothin' I did lack.\nI had fourteen caret gold in my mouth\nAnd silk upon my back.\nBut I did not trust my brother\nI carried him to blame.\nWhich led me to my fatal doom\nTo wander off in shame.\n\nKind l
EXTT7=adies and kind gentlemen\nSoon I will be gone.\nBut let me just warn you all\nBefore I do pass on.\nStay free from petty jealousies,\nLive by no man's code.\nAnd hold your judgment for yourself\nLest you wind up on this road.
EXTT8=I pity the poor immigrant\nWho wishes he would've stayed home\nWho uses all his power to do evil\nBut in the end is always left so alone\nThat man whom with his fingers cheats\nAnd whom lies with every breath\nWho passionately hates his life\nAnd li
EXTT8=kewise fears his death.\n\nI pity the poor immigrant\nWho's strength is spent in vain\nWho's heaven is like ironsides\nWho's tears are like rain\nWho eats but is not satisfied\nWho hears but does not see\nWho falls in love with wealth itself\nAnd tu
EXTT8=rns his back on me.\n\nI pity the poor immigrant\nWho tramples through the mud\nWho fills his mouth with laughing\nAnd who builds his town with blood\nWho's visions in the final end\nMust shatter like the glass\nI pity the poor immigrant\nWhen his g
EXTT8=ladness comes to pass
EXTT9=There was a wicked messenger from Eli he did come\nWith a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.\nWhen questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb\nFor his tongue it could not speak but only flatter.\n\nHe stayed behind the assembl
EXTT9=y hall it was there he made his bed\nOften times he could be seen returning.\nUntil one day he just appeared with a note in his hand which read\nThe soles of my feet I swear they're burning.\n\nFor the leaves began to falling and the seas began to p
EXTT9=art\nAnd the people that confronted him were many.\nAnd he was told with these few words which opened up his heart\nIf you can not bring good news then don't bring any
EXTT10=Down along the cove\nI spied my true love coming my way\nDown along the cove\nI spied my true love coming my way\nI said, "Lord have mercy momma,\nIt sure is good to see you comin' today."\n\nDown along the cove\nI spied my little bundle of joy\nDo
EXTT10=wn along the cove\nI spied my little bundle of joy\nShe said, "Lord have mercy honey,\nI'm so glad you're my boy."\n\nDown along the cove\nWe walked together hand in hand\nDown along the cove\nWe walked together hand in hand\nEverbody watchin' us a
EXTT10=go by\nKnows we're in love, yes they understand.
EXTT11=Close your eyes, close the door\nYou don't have to worry anymore\nI'll be your baby tonight\n\nShut the light, shut the shade\nYou don't have to be afraid\nI'll be your baby tonight\n\n   Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away\n   We're gonna for
EXTT11=get it\n   That big fat moon he's gonna shine like a spoon\n   But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it.\n\nKick your shoes off, do not fear\nBring that bottle over here\nI'll be your baby tonight
