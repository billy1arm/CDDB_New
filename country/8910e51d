EXTD=y 2006, roughly in time for the 40th anniversary of Merle Haggard
EXTD='s debut album, Capitol Nashville launched an ambitious Haggard c

EXTD=, each adorned with bonus tracks. All these albums had been reiss

EXTD=EMI or BGO, but they've never have been given such an excellent 
EXTD=treatment as they are here. The albums are paired together in log

EXTD=hese recordings the best sound they've ever had, the front cover 
EXTD=artwork is reproduced for each album on a two-fer, and the liner

EXTD=leased singles and finds Haggard in debt to his influences. It al

EXTD=nto his own on Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down. By this
EXTD=album, he had assembled his backing band, the Strangers, and dev
EXTD=eloped his signature lean, tough Bakersfield sound, epitomized by
EXTD=the two singles in the title of the album. Those are hardly the

EXTD='s first album Strangers was an impressive debut. Apart from the 
EXTD=classic singles "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers," "Sam Hill,
EXTD=" "Sing A Sad Song," and "I'm Gonna Break Every Heart I Can," the
EXTD=re's a number of fine album cuts, including "I'd Trade All of My 
EXTD=Tomorrows," "If I Had Left It Up To You," and "You Don't Even Try

EXTD=ase for nearly every country album recorded in the '60s. What cou

EXTD=, Hollywood, California. Includes liner notes by Daniel Cooper and 
EXTD=Bonnie Owens.\n\nAlthough Merle Haggard's early hits are widely a
EXTD=vailable on a number of anthologies, for years his original album
EXTD=s have been out of print. Koch Records has begun to rectify this 
EXTD=situation by rereleasing a number of Haggard's early Capitol albu
EXTD=ms, among them his first album, STRANGERS.\n\nSTRANGERS shows Hag
EXTD=gard still experimenting with the sound that would define his ear
EXTD=ly hits. A few of the tracks here feature the spare dobro-centere
EXTD=d arrangements of his late '60s hits, but many others are heavily
EXTD=orchestrated (perhaps to mimic the "Nashville sound" that domina
EXTD=ted the country charts at the time). Unlike his later albums, STR
EXTD=ANGERS includes relatively few Haggard originals, none of them pr
EXTD=ison songs. Still, STRANGERS has plenty to recommend it, includin
EXTD=g a rare novelty song ("Sam Hill"), a fine Ernest Tubb cover ("Wa
EXTD=lking The Floor Over You") and several strong originals ("Hey Mr.
EXTD=DJ," "You Don't Have Far To Go"). In addition, STRANGERS offers 
EXTD=a glimpse of one of country's greats at the very outset of his ca
EXTD=reer, before he or the public had defined his public persona.\n\n
