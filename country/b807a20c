EXTD=, 1999\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: When Waylon Jennings hooked up with 
EXTD=songwriter Billy Joe Shaver, he found the perfect author for his 
EXTD=obsessions, his fascinations, and his very image. Waylon had alwa
EXTD=ys been looking, perhaps unintentionally, for a common ground bet
EXTD=ween country and rock, and Shaver's songs -- sketching an outlaw 
EXTD=stance with near defiance and borrowing rock attitude to create t
EXTD=he hardest country tunes imaginable -- were perfect. On his previ
EXTD=ous album, Waylon had sung that "ladies love outlaws," but now he
EXTD=found the music that would soon be called outlaw country, a defi
EXTD=ant, ballsy blend of mythmaking and truth-telling. Shaver never h
EXTD=ad a better voice for his songs, and Jennings never had better so
EXTD=ngs for his style. Honky Tonk Heroes arrived at a crucial moment,
EXTD=a time when true honky tonk was fading, so only a dose of rock &
EXTD=roll could save it. And, no matter how much rock attitude is her
EXTD=e, this is pure country in its stance and attitude -- yet Honky T
EXTD=onk Heroes' very defiance makes it a perfect discovery album for 
EXTD=listeners who never thought they would like country music. And th
EXTD=e songs! Shaver earned his stripes here, with songs that were emo
EXTD=tional, funny, and clever, utterly bringing the mythic outlaw eth
EXTD=ic to life. "Black Rose," "You Asked Me To," and "Honky Tonk Hero
EXTD=es" remain among the greatest things Waylon ever cut, and every o
EXTD=ther song here matches them. Few country albums have ever been th
EXTD=is consistent, and few records, from any genre, have been as cons
EXTD=istently compelling. A wonderful album -- one that's hard to tire

EXTD=ng\nAccording to legend, it was at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July
EXTD=picnic when Waylon Jennings drunkenly promised a nobody named Bi
EXTD=lly Joe Shaver that he'd record a whole album of his songs. Appar
EXTD=ently it wasn't until Shaver threatened physical violence on Jenn
EXTD=ings (in front of a Nashville studio full of people) that he fina
EXTD=lly made good on his promise, although Jennings had only recently
EXTD=been granted full artistic control by RCA. The result was a stun
EXTD=ning achievement: 1973's Honky Tonk Heroes was the defining recor
EXTD=d of the anti-Nashville Outlaw movement--the term came after the 
EXTD=album--and a cornerstone in country music history. Featuring bare
EXTD=bones production and plainspoken, hard-nosed lyrics that celebra
EXTD=ted personal freedoms and simple pleasures, the record was a far 
EXTD=cry from the demure Nashville Sound. In each other, Jennings and 
EXTD=Shaver had found a kindred spirit, and together they rewrote the

EXTD=Smallchief\n\nWell, everybody knows the story about how an unkno
EXTD=wn songwriter named Billy Joe Shaver talked the semi-famous singe
EXTD=r Waylon Jennings into recording his songs. The result was the fi
EXTD=rst "outlaw" country album. \n\nRecord producers seem to think th
EXTD=e last person who should be consulted on their music is the music
EXTD=ian. Waylon, who was lonesome, on'ry, and mean, bucked the system
EXTD=and determined that he was going to make music his way. "Honky T
EXTD=onk Heros" was the result, a rough-edged collection of simple son
EXTD=gs and spare arrangements. Acoustic guitar and harmonica lead the
EXTD=instruments on most tracks. \n\n"Honky Tonk Heroes" won't sound 
EXTD=all that revolutionary to the modern listener, but it's still goo
EXTD=d -- and I would buy this CD for the legends that surround it. Al
EXTD=l the songs on "Honky Tonk Heroes" are good - probably none belong
EXTD=in the top ten list of Waylon's best. My favorite is "Omaha" whi
EXTD=ch has one of those melodies that stick in your head for days on 
EXTD=end. \n\nWaylon's gone now - I don't think Billy Joe ever made any
EXTD=money although he's now an elder statesman accepting homage from
EXTD=callers at his trailer house in Austin. (I don't know whether or
EXTD=not he lives in a trailer house. I just made that up cause it so

EXTD=\nWillie Nelson became "Willie Nelson" with his 1976 classic albu
EXTD=m "Red-Headed Stranger." Wayon Jennings became "Waylon Jennings" 
EXTD=with this 1973 release. All but one of the songs was written by B

EXTD=t album almost as good as Willie's. Thirty years ago a group of m
EXTD=usicians got together in Nashville and made this record, which at
EXTD=the time, was as un-Nashville as "country music" could possibly 
EXTD=get. This collection is folk-country-confessional art song, with 
EXTD=a touch of rock and blues. At least five of the songs are among t
EXTD=he best performances Waylon would ever manage. If you only want t

EXTD=a great choice. Such a decision would be a little unjust to Waylo

EXTD=dtunictroll (Earth, USA]\n\nAfter a tough contract renegotiation,
EXTD=Jennings was truly free of the Nashville machine. Free to produc

EXTD=what and where he pleased. The full fruition of these freedoms c

EXTD=find that this most un-Nashville album was recorded at the very h
EXTD=eart of all that Jennings was rebelling against musically: RCA's 
EXTD="Nashville Sound" studio. That it sounds absolutely nothing like 
EXTD=the prevailing Nashville pop is a tribute to Jennings, his co-pro
EXTD=ducer (Tompall Glaser), his band (The Waylors), his songwriter fo
EXTD=r this album (Billy Joe Shaver), and the sympathetic players Jenn
EXTD=ings brought in for the sessions. A further surprise is the lengt
EXTD=hy list of musicians, given the relative spareness of the product
EXTD=ions.\n\nWhether or not the legend of a drunk Jennings promising 
EXTD=Shaver he'd record his songs is true, it's clear that no other so
EXTD=ngwriter of the day so vividly captured the singer's ethos. The s
EXTD=ongs combine outlaw rebellion, mythical storytelling, and a sense
EXTD=of all-out relief at being able to finally say what's on one's m
EXTD=ind. Its sentiments, couched in minimal arrangements, remain as s
EXTD=alty and vibrant as the day they were recorded.\n\nBuddha's reiss
EXTD=ue adds two bonus tracks to the original ten: Shaver's "Slow Roll
EXTD=in' Low" and the single version of Shaver and Jennings' "You Ask Me

EXTD=Nashville rowdy Billy Joe Shaver that he decided to record this 
EXTD=all-Shaver album (with the exception of the Fritts/Seals-penned "
