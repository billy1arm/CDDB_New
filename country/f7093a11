EXTD=ion Released June 17, 2003\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: The title Johnny
EXTD=Cash Sings Hank Williams and Other Favorite Tunes is slightly mi
EXTD=sleading, as Cash only covered four of Hank's classics on the ori
EXTD=ginal LP release, augmenting them with eight of his own. The bonu
EXTD=s-tracks edition adds another two Hank songs (and three more of C
EXTD=ash's originals), making the theme a little more complete. Hearin
EXTD=g one of country music's greatest artists performing the songs of
EXTD=another of country music's greatest artists is a real treat, and
EXTD=Cash's interpretations combine his own deep, soulful voice with 
EXTD=Williams' terrific phrasing and songwriting perfectly. The other 
EXTD=tracks on the disc read like a greatest-hits compilation, which i
EXTD=s fine, but raises the question of who this is marketed toward. P
EXTD=eople looking to start their Man in Black collection won't be too
EXTD=interested in his Hank cover tunes, and hardcore Cash-o-philes a
EXTD=lready have these versions of "Folsom Prison Blues," "I Walk the 
EXTD=Line," and "Come In Stranger." No matter what, it's a fun listen,
EXTD=proving that Cash could take any song, no matter how familiar th
EXTD=e original was, and make it his own. -- Zac Johnson \n \nAmazon.c
EXTD=om Customer Review\nA REAL DISAPPOINTMENT, December 26, 2004\nRev
EXTD=iewer: treffler2 (Minnetonka, MN) \nIf you purchase this CD with 
EXTD=the idea that you're going to get the exact sound of Johnny Cash 
EXTD=singing Hank Williams you remember from the original recording, y
EXTD=ou will be disappointed. Although many rave about the remastering
EXTD=, the cutting of the background chorus and several musicians take
EXTD=s a heavy toll on the nostalgic value of the music. What you now 
EXTD=get is the voice of Johnny Cash with minimal accompaniment--all w
EXTD=ell and good if pure vocal is your desire, but not so well and go
EXTD=od if you want the original package.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Revie
EXTD=w\nFine re-working of post-Sun collection of Sun sides, July 23, 
EXTD=2003\nReviewer: redtunictroll (Earth, USA) \nWhen Johnny Cash bol
EXTD=ted from Sun into the welcoming arms of Columbia, he left a good 
EXTD=helping of unreleased material in his former label's vault. Sun's
EXTD=owner savvily packaged this material across several singles and 
EXTD=albums and placed it in the market to compete (often very success
EXTD=fully) with Cash's newer Columbia releases. The original issue of
EXTD=this 1960 album was just such a collection, combining a quartet 
EXTD=of Hank Williams covers with a helping of Cash's original songs (
EXTD=picking up singles that were hits shortly after Cash left Sun, su
EXTD=ch as "Straight A's in Love," for example), and a cover of Leon P
EXTD=ayne's "I Love You Because."\n\nVarese's first-ever CD reissue of
EXTD=this album takes several liberties, including, most substantiall
EXTD=y, using the undubbed masters in preference to the original choru
EXTD=s-dubbed tracks. One can argue as to whether Cash originally inte
EXTD=nded for the undubbed trio recordings to go out, but there's no a
EXTD=rguing that removing the syrupy chorus (most likely charted by Ja
EXTD=ck Clement) only amplifies these tracks' true grit. Ironically, m
EXTD=any of Williams' own recordings were similarly overdubbed after t
EXTD=he singer's death, only to be re-released in original form in mor
EXTD=e recent times.\n\nWilliams' songs fit Cash's tic-tac rhythms to 
EXTD=a tee, with the pining "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love Wit
EXTD=h You)" and mournful "(I Heart That) Lonesome Whistle Blow" match
EXTD=ing Cash's emotional delivery particularly well. The latter, alon
EXTD=g with "Cold Cold Heart" appear here as bonus tracks, having inex
EXTD=plicably been left off the original album. Additional bonuses inc
EXTD=lude alternate versions of Cash's "Come Stranger" and "Wide Open 
EXTD=Road," as well as a chorus-backed take of "I Love You Because."\n
EXTD=\nLike many of the post-Sun assembly albums, this one isn't compl
EXTD=etely coherent, and duplicates key Cash tracks available in many 
EXTD=places. But with a chance to hear the undubbed masters of the Wil
EXTD=liams' tracks, this provides compelling, new ground for domestic 
EXTD=Cash collectors.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nGreat Material, W
