EXTD=Terrific!, September 2, 2004 \nBy  Barron Laycock "Labradorman" 
EXTD=(Temple, New Hampshire United States]\n\nThis album was released 
EXTD=when John was at the apex of his popularity, and the songs on thi
EXTD=s album served to continue his ride into the stratosphere. From t
EXTD=he wry and yet poignant "I'd Rather Be A Cowboy" to the incredibl
EXTD=e smash hit "Farewell Andromeda", John Denver showcases his incre
EXTD=dible talents here. Denver was instrumental in firmly fixing the 
EXTD=younger generation's sights and sensibilities upon the outdoors i
EXTD=n general and on environmental issues in particular, and he nearl
EXTD=y single-handedly began the outdoor backpacking, hiking, and orie
EXTD=nteering movements after popularizing the idea of a more close an
EXTD=d intimate human relationship with mother nature. Therefore, more
EXTD=than a few of the young baby-boomers, like John, were more than 
EXTD=ready for the kind of unconventional intimacy with nature he sang
EXTD=about so effortlessly and so elegantly. From "Zachary And Jennif
EXTD=er" to an evocative and almost ethereal "Rocky Mountain Suite'", 
EXTD=Denver's songs soar in their description of the beauties of a sim
EXTD=ple and natural life and in being close to the "great wide-open'.
EXTD=\n\nDenver also does an unusually good rendition of "Berkeley Wo
EXTD=man", written by a friend but usually identified with Denver hims
EXTD=elf. He shows that even a sugary sweetheart like him can have som
EXTD=e "colorful" thoughts about women. Indeed, the simple and well ar

EXTD=songs like "Sweet Misery" or with covers of others' work, the kid

EXTD=e well lived. My special favorites here are "Berkeley Woman" and 
EXTD="I'd Rather be A Cowboy", and I always wondered why they weren't 
EXTD=bigger hits for John. Hearing John sing in his youthful enthusias
EXTD=m about what turns him on is still a rare treat. As with many of 
EXTD=his albums, the message outlives the messenger. It has successful

EXTD=ZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA supurb folk album..., October 2, 1999 
EXTD=\nBy A Customer\n\n\nJohn had some tall shoes to fill in his firs
EXTD=t release after Rocky Mountain High, and Farewell Andromeda fills
EXTD=them entirly, if in a slightly different style. This album has t
EXTD=he unique feel of a real folk album, every track smoothly introdu
EXTD=ces the next, and John is right on target with every one of them.
EXTD=John opens with a riviting performance of one of his finest comp
EXTD=ositions, "I'd Rather Be a Cowboy". As the album continues you ar
EXTD=e treated to a wide variety great tunes, from a cover of John Pri
EXTD=ne's "Angels From Montgomery" to the albums closing title track "
EXTD=Farewell Andromeda" (Welcome to My Morning). What seperates this 
EXTD=album from the rest is John's relaxed set of flok songs. You get 
EXTD=the feeling that he is singing for you. This is what he would pla
EXTD=y if he were with you in the mountains, on a picnic, or out fishi
EXTD=ng. It is as if he made this album especially for the times when 
EXTD=you need to get away and take your mind to a simpler place. Buy i

EXTD=ER REVIEW\nAngel from Montgomery, November 19, 2003 \nBy A Custom
EXTD=er\n\nYou have to appreciate that it is most simplistic to critic
EXTD=ize an artist for their excess, not for what did well.\n\nThis al
EXTD=bum was an example of some stunning interpretations of songs that
EXTD=worked for this artist. Angel from Montgomery, Please Daddy and 
EXTD=Rocky Mountain Suite are vital, warm and stand the test. It is di
EXTD=sappointing that John Denver never received his due for this type
EXTD=of work. \n\nAlong with Darcy Farrow and Mother Nature's Son on 
EXTD=Rocky Mountain High his work was true. You can ask for little mor
EXTD=e.\n\nPlus, he could sing. A high true tenor. Ease up on the crit
