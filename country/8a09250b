EXTD=Muscle man Aaron Tippin is a two-trick pony. If it's knee-jerk patriotism 
EXTD=you want, or even redneck cheek (though not chic), he's your man. On Stars
EXTD=and Stripes, he plays both themes for all they're worth but never reaches v
EXTD=ery high. The kickoff tune, "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly

EXTD=erty Bell--and romanticizes the U.S. as a nation where "hard work pays off
EXTD=the way it should." While his cocky Carolina delivery renders "I'll Take 
EXTD=Love over Money" barely listenable, he generally fares better with the in-
