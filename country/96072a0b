EXTD=RT REVIEW: David Allan Coe's debut album, released in 1969 shortly after 
EXTD=his release from prison, is in its way a wonder. Penitentiary Blues is fa
EXTD=r more a blues album than it is a country record, musically styled after 
EXTD=the dark, loungy blues of Charlie Rich and Jerry Lee Lewis in his Mercury
EXTD=period as well as the rawer mercurial blues of Bo Diddley, Lightnin' Hop

EXTD=he fact he will because he's been inside so long (for Coe it was almost 2
