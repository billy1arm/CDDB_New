EXTD=yperbolium (Earth, USA]\n\nBy 1967, Owens and his Buckaroos seeme
EXTD=d to knock out fine albums just as easily as they breathed. Thoug
EXTD=h it certainly didn't make them complacent, there's a certain eas
EXTD=e to these songs that takes a bit of the edge off the Bakersfield
EXTD=sound. Riding the crest of his incredible artistic and popular s
EXTD=uccess, Owens never took his fans for granted, hence his personal
EXTD=creed became the title of this album. These tracks (all written 
EXTD=or co-written by Owens) were laid down in 1966 and 1967, while th
EXTD=e Buckaroos were busy conquering the world - their live albums fr
EXTD=om Carnegie Hall and Japan were only two of their accomplishments
EXTD=from the road. This album was released in 1968.\n\nAll of the cl
EXTD=assic Bakersfield elements are present, including harmony singing
EXTD=between Owens and Don Rich on "The Way That I Love You" and "Hea
EXTD=rtbreak Mountain," and Owens doubling himself on the other tracks
EXTD=Rich's instrumental prowess is all over the album, with electri
EXTD=c and acoustic guitar leads complimenting his fiddle and gut-stri
EXTD=ng playing. The Buckaroos rhythm section provides its usual sterl
EXTD=ing support , and Tom Brumley's pedal steel shines throughout. It
EXTD='s a formula that the band had honed to perfection, and the ease 
EXTD=with which they purveyed it by 1968 doesn't lessen the brilliance
EXTD=of its invention.\n\nUnlike many of the Buckaroos' other albums,
EXTD=this one isn't anchored by multiple chart-topping singles. The t
EXTD=itle track (included in both its stereo album and mono single ver
EXTD=sions) is perhaps the best known, along with "Where Does the Good
EXTD=Times Go" (also included in both album and single version). This
EXTD=leaves the rest of the album to play for most listeners as an al
EXTD=bum, rather than a collection of tracks pulled together from know
EXTD=n hits. Only two other sides ("The Way That I Love You" and "You 
EXTD=Left Her Lonely Too Long") were issued as 45s. Most of the album'
EXTD=s tracks will be fresh ground for those acquainted only with Owen
EXTD=s' anthologies, making this an excellent addition to a fan's libr
EXTD=ary.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nLate -60's Buck, October 27
EXTD=, 2006\nBy Jess "Jess" (Coal Country, PA]\n\nHere is another grea
EXTD=t re-release by SunDazed Records from the Buck Owens Catalog. I a
EXTD=dmit I prefer the early Buck Owens' sound, and this CD really has
EXTD=nothing wrong with it - especially if you prefer the more polishe
EXTD=d and later sound of Buck and the Boys. But, I find it to lack th
EXTD=e energy and enthusiasm (exuberance?) of the earlier recordings. 
EXTD=But, with that said, I would whip out my billfold and buy a dozen
EXTD=copies of this CD before spending a penny on the trash coming ou
EXTD=t of Nashville today. There are 14 songs here, including the titl
EXTD=e track, "Where Does the Good Times Go", and "Let the World Keep 
EXTD=On Turning". As with all of the SunDazed collection, the sound is
EXTD=great and the liner notes are more than sufficient. As with all 
EXTD=of these re-releases, you would be smart to grab them while you s
EXTD=till can. They wont be available forever!\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOME

EXTD=\nThis Buck Owens album was released in January of 1968. The song
EXTD=s were recorded between April of 1966 and August of 1967. There w
EXTD=ere two big hits from the album: "It Takes People Like You" and "
EXTD=Where Does the Good Times Go". Most of the other songs on the alb
EXTD=um are good, too. Especially noteworthy is "Let the World Keep on
EXTD=A Turnin'", which Buck rerecorded a few months later with his so
EXTD=n, Buddy Alan. That duet version was released as a single and bec
EXTD=ame a bit hit. This is another solid Buck Owens album.
