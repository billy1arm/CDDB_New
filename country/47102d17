EXTT0=JIMMIE RODGERS\n\n(from AMG]\n\nHis brass plaque in the Country Musi
EXTT0=c Hall of Fame reads, "Jimmie Rodgers' name stands foremost in the cou
EXTT0=ntry music field as the man who started it all." This is a fair assess
EXTT0=ment. The "Singing Brakeman" and the "Mississippi Blue Yodeler," whos
EXTT0=e six-year career was cut short by tuberculosis, became the first nati
EXTT0=onally known star of country music and the direct influence of many la
EXTT0=ter performers from Hank Snow and Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams to Lef
EXTT0=ty Frizzell and Merle Haggard. Rodgers sang about rounders and gambler
EXTT0=s, bounders and ramblers  and he knew what he sang about. At age 14 h
EXTT0=e went to work as a railroad brakeman, and on the rails he stayed unti
EXTT0=l a pulmonary hemorrhage sidetracked him to the medicine show circui
EXTT0=t in 1925. The years with the trains harmed his health but helped hi
EXTT0=s music. In an era when Rodgers' contemporaries were singing only moun
EXTT0=tain and mountain/folk music, he fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz
EXTT0=, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk - and many of his best songs were his co
EXTT0=mpositions, including "TB Blues," "Waiting for a Train," "Travelin' Bl
EXTT0=ues," "Train Whistle Blues," and his thirteen blue yodels. Although Ro
EXTT0=dgers wasn't the first to yodel on records, his style was distinct fro
EXTT0=m all the others. His yodel wasn't merely sugar-coating on the song, i
EXTT0=t was as important as the lyric, mournful and plaintive or happy and c
EXTT0=arefree, depending on a song's emotional content. His instrumental acc
EXTT0=ompaniment consisted sometimes of his guitar only, while at other time
EXTT0=s a full jazz band (horns and all) backed him up. Country fans could h
EXTT0=ave asked for no better hero/star  someone who thought what they thou
EXTT0=ght, felt what they felt, and sang about the common person honestly an
EXTT0=d beautifully. In his last recording session, Rodgers was so racked an
EXTT0=d ravaged by tuberculosis that a cot had to be set up in the studio, s
EXTT0=o he could rest before attempting that one song more. No wonder Jimmi
EXTT0=e Rodgers is to this day loved by country music fans.\nThe youngest so
EXTT0=n of a railroad man, Jimmie Rodgers was born and raised in Meridian, M
EXTT0=ississippi. Following his mother's death in 1904, he and his older bro
EXTT0=ther went to live with their mother's sister, where he first became in
EXTT0=terested in music. Jimmie's aunt was a former teacher who held degree
EXTT0=s in music and English, and she exposed him to a number of different s
EXTT0=tyles of music, including vaudeville, pop and dance hall. Though he wa
EXTT0=s attracted to music, he was a mischievous boy and often got into trou
EXTT0=ble. When he returned to his father's care in 1911, Jimmie ran wild, h
EXTT0=anging out in pool halls and dives, yet he never got into any seriou
EXTT0=s trouble. When he was 12, he experienced his first taste of fame whe
EXTT0=n he sang "Steamboat Bill" at a local talent contest. Rodgers won th
EXTT0=e concert and, inspired by his success, he decided to head out on th
EXTT0=e road in his own travelling tent show. His father immediately tracke
EXTT0=d him down and brought him back home, yet he ran away again, this tim
EXTT0=e joining a medicine show. The romance of performing with the show wor
EXTT0=e off by the time his father hunted him down. Given the choice of scho
EXTT0=ol or the railroad, Jimmie chose to join his father on the tracks
EXTT0=\n\nFor the next ten years, Rodgers worked on the railroad, performin
EXTT0=g a variety of jobs along the south and west coasts. In May of 1917, h
EXTT0=e married Sandra Kelly after knowing her for only a handful of weeks
EXTT0=by the fall, they had separated, even though she was pregnant (thei
EXTT0=r daughter died in 1938). Two years later they officially divorced, an
EXTT0=d around the same time, he met Carrie Williamson, a preacher's daughte
EXTT0=r. Rodgers married Carrie in April of 1920, while she was still in hig
EXTT0=h school. Shortly after their marriage, Jimmie was laid off by the Ne
EXTT0=w Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, and he began performing various blu
EXTT0=ecollar jobs, looking for opportunities to sing. Over the next three y
EXTT0=ears, the couple was plagued with problems, ranging from financial t
EXTT0=o health  the second of their two daughters died of diphtheria six mo
EXTT0=nths after her birth in 1923. By that time, Rodgers had begun to regul
EXTT0=arly play in travelling shows, and he was on the road at the time of h
EXTT0=er death. Though these years were difficult, they were important in th
EXTT0=e development of Jimmie's musical style as he began to develop his dis
EXTT0=tinctive blue yodel and worked on his guitar skills.\n\nIn 1924, Jimmi
EXTT0=e Rodgers was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but instead of heeding th
EXTT0=e doctor's warning about the seriousness of the disease, he discharge
EXTT0=d himself from the hospital to form a trio with fiddler Slim Rozell an
EXTT0=d his sister-in-law Elsie McWilliams. Rodgers continued to work on th
EXTT0=e railroad and perform blackface comedy with medicine shows while he s
EXTT0=ang. Two years after being diagnosed with TB, he moved his family ou
EXTT0=t to Tucson, Arizona, believing the change in location would improve h
EXTT0=is health. In Tucson, he continued to sing at local clubs and events
EXTT0=The railroad believed these extracurricular activities interefered w
EXTT0=ith his work and fired him. Moving back to Meridian, Jimmie and Carri
EXTT0=e lived with her parents, before he moved away to Asheville, North Car
EXTT0=olina in 1927. Rodgers was going to work on the railroad, but his heal
EXTT0=th was so poor he couldn't handle the labor - he would never work the r
EXTT0=ails again. Instead, he began working as a janitor and a cab driver, s
EXTT0=inging on a local radio station and events as well. Soon, he moved t
EXTT0=o Johnson City, Tennessee, where he began singing with the string ban
EXTT0=d the Tenneva Ramblers. Prior to Rodgers, the group had existed as a t
EXTT0=rio, but he persuaded the members to become his backing band because h
EXTT0=e had a regular show in Asheville. The Ramblers relented and the group
EXTT0='s name took second billing to Rodgers, and the group began playing va
EXTT0=rious concerts in addition to the radio show. Eventually, Rodgers hear
EXTT0=d that Ralph Peer, an RCA talent scout, was recording hillbilly and st
EXTT0=ring bands in Bristol, Tennessee. Jimmie convinced the band to trave
EXTT0=l to Bristol, but on the eve of the audition, they had a huge argumen
EXTT0=t about the proper way they should be billed, resulting in the Tennev
EXTT0=a Ramblers breaking away from Rodgers. Jimmie went to the audition a
EXTT0=s a solo artist and Peer recorded two songs  the old standards "The S
EXTT0=oldier's Sweetheart" and "Sleep, Baby, Sleep"  after rejecting Rodger
EXTT0=s' signature song, "T for Texas."\n\nReleased in October of 1927, th
EXTT0=e record was not a hit, but Victor did agree to record Rodgers again
EXTT0=, this time as a solo artist. In November of 1927, he cut four songs
EXTT0=, including "T for Texas." Retitled "Blue Yodel" upon its release, th
EXTT0=e song became a huge hit and one of only a handful of early country re
EXTT0=cords to sell a million copies. Shortly after its release, Jimmie an
EXTT0=d Carrie moved to Washington, where he began appearing on a weekly loc
EXTT0=al radio show billed as the Singing Brakeman. Though "Blue Yodel" wa
EXTT0=s success, its sales grew steadily throughout early 1928, which mean
EXTT0=t that the couple weren't able to reap the financial benefits until th
EXTT0=e end of the year. By that time, Jimmie had recorded several more sing
EXTT0=les, including the hits "Way Out on the Mountain," "Blue Yodel No. 4,
EXTT0=" "Waiting for a Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now." On various session
EXTT0=s, Peer experimented with Rodgers' backing band, occasionally recordin
EXTT0=g him with two other string instrumentalists and recording his solo a
EXTT0=s well. Over the next two years, Peer and Rodgers tried out a number o
EXTT0=f different backing bands, including a jazz group featuring Louis Arms
EXTT0=trong, orchestras, and a Hawaiian combo.\n\nBy 1929, Jimmie Rodgers ha
EXTT0=d become an official star, as his concerts became major attractions an
EXTT0=d his records consistently sold well. During 1929, he made a small fil
EXTT0=m called The Singing Brakeman, recorded many songs, and toured through
EXTT0=out the country. Though his activity kept his star shining and the mon
EXTT0=ey rolling in, his health began to decline under all the stress. Never
EXTT0=theless, he continued to plow forward, recording numerous songs and bu
EXTT0=ilding a large home in Kerrville, Texas, as well as working with Wil
EXTT0=l Rogers on several fund-raising tours for the Red Cross that were des
EXTT0=igned to help those suffering from the Depression. By the middle of 19
EXTT0=31, the Depression was beginning to affect Rodgers as well, as his con
EXTT0=cert bookings decreased dramatically and his records stopped selling
EXTT0=Despite the financial hardships, Jimmie continued to record.\n\nNo
EXTT0=t only did the Great Depression cut into Jimmie's career, but so did h
EXTT0=is poor health. He had to decrease the number of concerts he performe
EXTT0=d in both 1931 and 1932, and by 1933, his health affected his recordin
EXTT0=g and forced him to cancel plans for several films. Despite his condit
EXTT0=ion, he refused to stop performing, telling his wife that "I want to d
EXTT0=ie with my shoes on." By early 1933, the family was running short on m
EXTT0=oney, and he had to perform anywhere he could  including vaudeville s
EXTT0=hows and nickelodeons  to make ends meet. For a while he performed o
EXTT0=n a radio show in San Antonio, but in February he collapsed and was se
EXTT0=nt to the hospital. Realizing that he was close to death, he convince
EXTT0=d Peer to schedule a recording session in May. Rodgers used that sessi
EXTT0=on to provide needed financial support for his family. At that session
EXTT0=, Jimmie was accompanied by a nurse and rested on a cot in between son
EXTT0=gs. Two days after the sessions were completed, he died of a lung hemo
EXTT0=rrhage on May 26, 1933. Following his death, his body was taken to Mer
EXTT0=idian by train, riding in a converted baggage car. Hundreds of countr
EXTT0=y fans awaited the body's arrival in Meridian, and the train blew it
EXTT0=s whistle consistently throughout its journey. For several days afte
EXTT0=r the body arrived in Rodgers' hometown, it lay in state as hundreds
EXTT0=, if not thousands, of people paid tribute to the departed musician
EXTT0=\n\nThe massive display of affection at Jimmie Rodgers' funeral servi
EXTT0=ces indicated what a popular and beloved star he was during his time
EXTT0=His influence wasn't limited to the '30s, however. Throughout countr
EXTT0=y music's history, echoes of Jimmie Rodgers can be heard, from Hank Wi
EXTT0=lliams to Merle Haggard. In 1961, Rodgers became the first artist indu
EXTT0=cted into the Country Music Hall of Fame - 25 years later, he was induc
EXTT0=ted as a founding father at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though bot
EXTT0=h honors are impressive, they only give a small indication of what Rod
EXTT0=gers accomplished  and how he affected the history of country music b
EXTT0=y making it viable, commercially popular medium  during his lifetime
