EXTD=ichard" (Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada]\n\nWell here it is, a spectacular boxset on Dolly Parton. A few medicore boxsets on Dolly have been released over the years, but they all pale in comparison to this beautiful gem. Featuring an informative 
EXTD=sixty page booklet on Miss Parton with rare pictures never seen before, the crowning jewel are seven tracks never released from Dolly's various record labels. The newly released songs are "Gonna Hurry (As Slow As I Can) which is one of the first song

EXTD="The Fairest of Them All" album in 1969 - "God's Coloring Book" recorded during the "Coat of Many Colors" 1971 sessions - and finally "Eugene Oregon" and "What Will Baby Be" from 1972's "My Tennessee Mountain Home" album recordings. Out of these seven 
EXTD=wonderful tracks four are really standouts - "Gonna Hurry" is true Dolly and she proves even at 10 years of age not only would she be a huge country music star, but a pop superstar. Her voice is pure, strong, original and unmistakingly Dolly. "Everyth
EXTD=ing's Beautiful" is a song Dolly wrote before she came to Nashville and it is truely one of the most beautiful songs she has ever written. It was the song Dolly sang to Porter Wagoner the very day he called her to his office in 1967 to hire her as hi

EXTD=MAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe best Dolly box out there, but still not definitive..., October 28, 2009 \nBy  Allen Chapman (STAFFORD SPRINGS, CT USA]\n\nFor years Dolly fans have been waiting for a definitive boxed set from her. "Dolly" comes pretty 
EXTD=close to being just that. With 99 tracks spread across four CD's there is an awful lot to like here. The set starts off with her very first recording "Puppy Love" and goes up thru 1992's "Romeo". Along the way are her solo hits as well as her duets w
EXTD=ith Porter Wagoner. The set follows her career from the small GoldBand record label thru her stay at Columbia, the main focus being of course her long tenure with RCA. The set begins with a string of early singles recorded for Monument Records when D

EXTD=nts. First is the fact that it ends in 1992. Dolly has continued to release some incredible records since then (such as her fantastic bluegrass albums from the past decade). Another complaint is that the massively successfull "Trio" album with Emmylo
EXTD=u Harris and Linda Ronstadt is not represented at all. Despite having tons of great tracks, it's a shame they couldn't find room for her 1983 song "Appalachian Memories" one of her masterpieces. Finally, disc four is the least interesting of the bunc
EXTD=h, the songs on disc four have been reissued so many times over the past several years that the disc is pretty redundant. \n\nComplaints aside this is the best collection of Dolly's work out there. It's not THE definitive set, but it is the best ther

EXTD=lly Parton's outsized personality has occasionally obscured the fact that she's one of America's all-time greatest songwriters and an exceptional vocalist who effortlessly crossed from country to pop and back again. Her early years as Porter Wagoner'

EXTD=hed over four decades, including an incredible string of hit singles (including 25 U.S. #1s) and albums (including 42 U.S. top-10s and 6 chart-toppers), and multiple live recordings, soundtracks and collaborations. She's won gold and platinum records
EXTD=, Grammys, AMAs, CMAs, ACMs, and has been nominated for Oscar, Tony and Golden Globe awards. She's a member of the Grand Ole Opry, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the recipient of numerous national awards and tributes. Yet, with all the f
EXTD=ame and honors, Parton has remained true to her rural upbringing in the hills of Tennessee, frequently returning to the hard lessons of her youth for inspiration and guidance. The values instilled by her dirt-poor upbringing have informed both her li
EXTD=fe and her art, as she frequently put stories and lessons from her childhood to song. \n\nAmong the most surprising aspects of Parton's recording career is how spottily her catalog has been kept in print or reissued. Numerous hits collections have fo
EXTD=und issue and reissue (including the excellent Essential set in 2005), and more recently a few original albums have been reissued on CD, but much of her RCA album catalog has remained in the vault, and until now, no major career-spanning (and more im
EXTD=portantly, label-spanning) box set had been issued. RCA Legacy solves the latter problem with this superb 4-disc, 99-song set. The collection comes with a 60-page booklet that includes an introductory essay from singer-songwriter Laura Cantrell, a 5,
EXTD=000-word biography by Holly George-Warren, period photos and reproductions of many of Parton's album covers. \n\nMore importantly, the 4 CDs cover a big helping Parton's career, including rare late-50s pre-teen sides on Goldband, early work for Mercu
EXTD=ry and Monument, a generous helping from nearly two decades on RCA, and a smattering of tracks from her years on Columbia, ending with 1993's "Romeo." Missing are sides from her 1998 back-to-basics album Hungry Again, the inventive releases she cut f
EXTD=or Sugar Hill in the '90s and '00s, and last year's Backwoods Barbie. So while it's not a complete portrait, the ready availability of these later albums suggests their omission made room for the rare early works, deeper album cuts and seven previous
EXTD=ly unreleased recordings, while still maintaining the core hit material one would expect of a mainstream box set. \n\nThose who've hung on to their original LPs or snapped up CD reissues will duplicate a good deal of Parton's hits, but there are many
EXTD=new riches here. The eleven-year-old Parton's voice is faintly recognizable on the 1957 Goldband single "Puppy Love" and its flip, "Girl Left Alone." The A-side is an original rockabilly tune, co-written with her uncle Bill Owens (with whom she'd al
EXTD=so write her first charting song, Bill Phillips' "Put it Off Until Tomorrow," also included) - the B-side is an original country ballad, again written with Owens. Parton's voice is juvenilely high and thin, but she was already singing with tremendous 
EXTD=feeling. The previously unreleased "Gonna Hurry (As Slow As I Can)" is a finished '50s-styled ballad that sounds to be from a couple years later. The pre-teen edge to Parton's voice was giving way to the trilled edge that would come to define her sin
EXTD=ging. \n\nSkipping forward five years to 1962, Parton cut a single for Mercury while still in high school. The A-side "It's Sure Gonna Hurt," co-written again by Parton and Phillips, perfectly evokes the pain of a teenager's broken heart with the mid
EXTD=tempo countrypolitan-pop sound of Brenda Lee and Connie Francis. The B-side "The Love You Gave" continues the romantic turmoil, and the unreleased session side "Nobody But You" finds Parton adding a hint of rockabilly with her upper range. By 1965 P
EXTD=arton was signed to Monument, who groomed her as a teen pop star. Among the highlights here are the brilliant Shangri-Las styled "Don't Drop Out," complete with a dramatically spoken intro, and the obscure Goffin-King composition "I've Known You All 
EXTD=My Life." None of these made the charts, but Parton sounds so convincing and at-home, you can hear why they tried. \n\nHaving failed to break her as a pop star, Monument let Parton record country, releasing her first two charting singles "Dumb Blonde
EXTD=" and "Something Fishy," as well as her debut album, Hello, I'm Dolly. Parton's songwriting emerged fully formed in songs of hurting and abandoned women, home-spun morals, and the colorful characters of rural life. She soon departed for RCA, but left
EXTD=enough tracks in the vault for Monument to issue a second album in 1970. Parton stayed at RCA for nearly two decades, her career initially shepherded closely by Porter Wagoner, with whom she recorded numerous duets. One listen to their chemistry on 
EXTD=a 1967 cover of Tom Paxton's "Last Thing on My Mind" makes it clear just how painful their separation must have been for Wagoner. The loss of her business may have stung, but the departure of such a feeling duet partner must have really hurt. \n\nPar
EXTD=ton's solo sides, whether originals or pulled from Nashville songwriters, continued to make emotional strides to self-awareness (and eventually self-empowerment) as her downtrodden women took clear-eyed stock of their situations. Parton's original, "
EXTD=The Bridge," depicts a relationship's pastoral beginnings and tragic, helpless ending, but the title track of Just Because I'm a Woman, calls out the hypocrisy with which women were treated. Her RCA catalog fills out disc one, all of discs two and th
EXTD=ree, and nearly half of disc four with hits, lower-charting singles and lesser-known but no less rewarding album tracks. This is easily the most expansive view you'll find of her development as a songwriter and singer. The volume of quality original 
EXTD=material and the imaginative range of her subjects are staggering, and the new fire she brings to chestnuts like Jimmie Rodgers' "Muleskinner Blues" is just as impressive. \n\nEven after splitting with Wagoner in 1976 the hits kept coming. Parton's f
EXTD=irst self-produced album, New Harvest... First Gathering was recorded in Los Angeles and edged "Light of a Clear Blue Morning" onto Billboard's Hot-100. Her next LP, Here You Come Again, sprung its title song to #2 on the adult contemporary chart and
EXTD=#3 on the Hot 100. Hollywood Dolly really hit her crossover peak in the early '80s with "9 to 5," a cover of the First Edition's "You Know I Love You," "Islands in the Sun," and a modernized remake of the Drifters' "Save the Last Dance For Me." In c
EXTD=ontrast to the box set's first two discs, Parton's crossover material is often taken from other songwriters' pens, and doesn't ring as heartfelt or close-to-the-bone as her earlier works. Still, even among the mainstream pop she dropped the home-spun
EXTD="Applejack" and "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You," the gospel-tinged "Do I Ever Cross Your Mind," and the superb "Tennessee Homesick Blues" from the Rhinestone film soundtrack. \n\nBy the middle-80s Parton's production had fallen into others' 
EXTD=hands, and they increasingly surrounded her with synthetic drums and synthesizers. Parton herself was still in fine voice, but the chill in the instrumental backings didn't connect with or amplify her personal warmth, and the arrangements have aged p
EXTD=oorly. A switch to Columbia in the late '80s returned Parton to country songwriting and more timeless pop productions. Disc four's closing eight tracks, drawn from albums recorded between 1988 and 1993, restore Parton's identity as a songwriter, and 
EXTD=Ricky Skaggs' production (which drew on some hot-picking bluegrass musicians) for White Limozeen was the most sympathetic she'd had in several years. Many of Parton's fans will enjoy the entire tour through the first thirty-seven years of her career,
EXTD=but those mostly enchanted by the country sides will find themselves skipping her late-70s and early-80s pop material. Don't miss the Columbia sides on disc four, though, as they're superb. \n\nLeaving off Parton's resurgent sides for Sugar Hill kee
EXTD=ps this box from being a complete portrait to date. Her work on Columbia shows the artistic well far from dry, and her return to basic productions and bluegrass backings in the '90s and '00s are an important chapter in her stll-lively career. Still, 
EXTD=these four discs amply demonstrate that Parton is much more than a singer and songwriter: she's a folklorist, cultural anthropologist, family historian, philosopher and memoirist. Her autobiography, Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business, is a 
EXTD=good read, but can't possibly offer the emotional richness of songs like "My Tennessee Mountain Home" or "Coat of Many Colors." What's really missing, and what Parton's fans long for, are original album reissues of her entire RCA and Columbia catalog

EXTD=ich is really a shame because this is probably one of the best compilation and special career-spanning box collections released in a long while for a big artist like Dolly Parton. Let's get one thing straight - this is not a 'greatest hits' collection
EXTD=Neither is it a 'definitive' collection. Yes, there are noticeably some big hits missing and the collection of songs ends with the early 1990s. Still, why is it worth buying? Well, first, it's reasonably priced and affordable. Through Amazon, for j
EXTD=ust a bit over $35.00 you are able to purchase 99 songs from Dolly Parton's career. Many of these tracks are from CDs that are either hard to find or out of print. This collection's songs are polished and sound better than ever, unlike most compilati
EXTD=on sets that are lazily pieced together without a lot of thought or attention to the tracks. Not so with 'Dolly'. This is in many ways career-spanning in that it features tracks from many periods of Dolly Parton's life and career - from her first trac
EXTD=k "Puppy Love" through the Porter Wagner years - from her first solo efforts through her pop and disco years. Even though the box set neglects modern Parton whose done everything from bluegrass, cover songs of political songs to (most recently) classi
EXTD=c country, this set doesn't at all feel unfinished or lacking. It packs a punch with over four and a half hours worth of Dolly Parton music. Yes, it includes some of her big hits like "I Will Always Love You", "Two Doors Down" and "9 to 5", but it al
EXTD=so exposes the listener to a host of Dolly that gives you a complete sense of who she is as an artist and what makes her, as the sticker on the box boasts, a legend. \n\nThe Good: Again, the best part of this set is that it's reasonably price. The re
EXTD=tail price is in the upper $40 range - still, you are getting 99 songs, a slim box that encases the discs and a well-produced 60+ page book that contains a short biography of Parton, covering her life and music. I felt the strength of this set was tha
EXTD=t it did not rely solely on her 'greatest hits' that have been released ten fold on previous releases. Instead, it gives the Dolly fan and basic music consumer access to music that is hard to find and even goes so far to make each track sound better 
EXTD=than ever. 'Dolly' is more of a musical autobiography than it is a collection of hits - there's a chronological order to the music so you're taken from her almost unrecognizable child-like voice on "Puppy Love" through dozens of songs that showcase he
EXTD=r strength and versatility as a music artist. This set also celebrates her career rather than focusing on one aspect or period - the music she did with Porter Wagner and early on in her career of course may not be as well-known by a younger audience a
EXTD=s her hits "9 to 5" or "Islands in the Stream" duet with Kenny Rogers, but the older and lesser known tracks are featured alongside the popular tracks just the same. It's an enjoyable listening experience listening to Parton go from classic country t
EXTD=o dabbling in pop/disco on tracks like "Baby I'm Burning". In all, the quality of this set really took me by surprise and it's a shame it's not being promoted more because if you're a Dolly Parton fan, or even a casual fan of hers, perhaps even just 
EXTD=curious of her, this set was made and compiled with you in mind. It's got something for everyone and does not let you down. \n\nThe Bad: After reading the 60+ page booklet that comes with the set, it was clear to me that this was not meant to be a gr
EXTD=eatest hits album. It's something of an autobiography or storyteller's edition. If you read the book and get the inside scoop on some of the tracks, you'll see the purpose of the 4 CD set is to reveal and follow Dolly Parton's rise to fame and popula
EXTD=rity. That being said, if there was a flaw in the set it's that it comes a bit short of being a true career-spanning collection. It would have been made even better if it included tracks from the mid 1990s to today. Not including Parton's bluegrass e
EXTD=ra, or even her work on releases like 'Hungry Again', 'Those Were Days' or 'Backwoods Barbie' leaves something of an unfinished picture of the artist. It gives the impression to the unknowing listener or Dolly fan that after 1990, she hasn't done muc
EXTD=h worth acknowledging or celebrating. The entire vibe of 'Dolly' feels as if it's celebrating Dolly Parton and her great accomplishments and versatility as an artist. In a way, I wish there had been a subtitle acknowledging that this was not covering
EXTD=her entire career. Also, it would have been nice if there was some sort of video component included with this set. A DVD with her A&E biography would have been fitting - interviews or clips from other artists and professionals speaking of Parton, eve
EXTD=n music videos or clips of live performances (especially of her years with Porter Wagner) would have made this a truly well-rounded release. Still, it's a minor complaint and doesn't detract from the great quality of work put into the final product. 
EXTD=\n\nIn all, this is a must buy. With the collection of songs, including un-released tracks, 'Dolly' is a must-have and worth every penny. While it is not entirely career-spanning, the 99 tracks and accompanying mini-booklet definitely covers the earl
EXTD=y years through the early 90s of Parton's life and career and makes a great case for why she's a legend. Definitely worth buying. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nFrom Puppy love to Romeo, January 30, 2010 \nBy  Peter Durward Harris "Pete the music

EXTD=ring book is itself a CD rarity, having only appeared (so far) on the short-lived re-issue of Here You Come Again. The familiar version of Everything's beautiful in it's own way is a duet with Willie Nelson, which became a top ten country hit and has
EXTD=subsequently appeared on several Dolly compilations. I knew that Willie's vocals were overdubbed and that Dolly recorded nothing new for The Winning Hand, but I thought Dolly's vocals were from her Monument days. The version of the song in this box 
EXTD=is a 1969 recording, so if Dolly also recorded the song for Monument, it's another yet-unheard rarity in its solo form. \n\nGreat as all those tracks are, the most important previously unreleased track is Eugene Oregon, a song that I've never heard b
EXTD=efore in any form. It is an upbeat song in which Dolly expresses her thanks to the people of that city for making her feel welcome. \n\nAmong the eleven Porter and Dolly duets, the compilers found no room for three top five country hits (If teardrops
EXTD=were pennies, Say forever you'll be mine, Makin' plans), which is slightly disappointing, but anybody who really wants them can find these tracks easily elsewhere including on The Essential Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton. The eleven tracks selected
EXTD=included ten major country hits plus Jeannie's afraid of the dark, which charted despite being a B-side. \n\nLike the European box, this box has little to offer those fans who only love Dolly's pop-country music from 1977 to 1986. Most of the obviou
EXTD=s hits from the period are here, the major omissions being the 1982 version of I will always love you (but the 1973 version is included), Real love (a duet with Kenny Rogers) and Hard candy Christmas (which isn't a Christmas song but these days is ea
