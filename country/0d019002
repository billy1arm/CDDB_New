EXTD=W:  The second installment in ABKCO's series of box sets containing CD replicas of the Rolling Stones' singles and EPs, Singles 1965-1967 covers the classic period between "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "In Another Land," the time when the Stone
EXTD=s started to reach beyond their hard blues base, and created some of their most indelible music. Like the previous box, Singles 1963-1965, each of the group's British and American singles and EPs are represented, reproduced in paper sleeves and press
EXTD=ed on all-black CDs designed to look like a 45. Where that set had some rarities -- including the first release of such classic EPs as The Rolling Stones, 5 X 5, and Got Live If You Want It! -- every cut on this box has been on CD before (all showed 
EXTD=up on the triple-disc The Singles Collection: The London Years) and there is a slight tweaking of history here, with certain singles (like "Satisfaction," "Get Off of My Cloud," and "Paint It, Black") containing both the American and British B-sides.
EXTD=This may upset some purists, but it's a clever, efficient way to cover this ground - plus, even with the added song these discs run well under ten minutes, so it's a nice bonus that beefs up the discs slightly and makes them more listenable. Of cours
EXTD=e, this isn't designed for listenability in the first place, since changing the 11 discs is cumbersome, even with a multi-disc player -- it's really a set to look at and admire, to gaze at each of the picture sleeves. But, if they're listened to a di
EXTD=sc at a time, it does reveal what a splendid singles band the Rolling Stones were. There has never been a single as snide and cynical as "Satisfaction" backed by "The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man," while there has never been one as nasty 
EXTD=and antisocial as "Paint It, Black" b/w "Stupid Girl," and their rebel reputation was cemented by "Get Off of My Cloud" b/w "I'm Free." These are revelations that this set makes clear through its singles replicas, and it helps make this set a necessa

EXTD=ies covering all of the Rolling Stones' classic 45s in CD format, SINGLES 1965-1967 starts at the exact point where the Stones became more than just a better-than-average bunch of English boys declaring fealty to Chicago blues, "(I Can't Get No) Sati
EXTD=sfaction." Ending 11 discs (and numerous B-sides) later with the hazy "In Another Land"/"The Lantern" (the second single from the consistently underrated THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST), this set presents the period where the Stones truly earned the

EXTD=Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nThe purpose of this review is to completely compare the contents of "Singles Collection: The London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets which as a group contain the same songs plus more. There are some good comparisons 
EXTD=in the other reviews, but also several omissions and inaccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear things up a bit as to what songs are included on each, and which "missing" songs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, particularly
EXTD="More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these collections is rather expensive, so hopefully this may help you decide which sets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thing first though, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP 
EXTD=contained in the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the full length CD "Got Live If You Want It". They share the same title but that's all, and were actually two different releases. Buying the full length CD will NOT get you all the same
EXTD=songs on the EP as indicated in another review. With that out of the way..... \n\n"Singles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this box set, with the exception of 3 original British EP's exclusive
EXTD=to the box set. The first EP contains You Better Move On (also available on "December's Children") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 also available on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The second EP (originally titled "5 X 5")
EXTD=contains If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around and Around, all of which are also available on the "12 X 5" CD. The third EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contains early live versions
EXTD=of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alright, none of which are available on any other CD (with the possible exception of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same version include
EXTD=d on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early single/B-sides Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as well as I Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren't
EXTD=available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs not included elsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP. So the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" would appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967
EXTD=": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Both contain the single/B-sides Long Long While and We Love You (also available on "More Hot Rocks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your 
EXTD=Plane? which aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs not included elsewhere. No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1968-1971": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this 3rd box set, 
EXTD=with a few unique exceptions. The third box set additionally contains Everybody Needs Somebody to Love (also available on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and three non-ABKCO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-sides are the Ry Cooder instr
EXTD=umental Natural Magic (from the film "Performance" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bitch and Sway which were the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. My guess is the licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin Records, etc. an
EXTD=d hadn't yet been negotiated when "The London Years" was originally released back in 1989. The remixes appear to be 3 different "rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The box set also contains a bonus DVD (see the item description for more on
EXTD=that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on "More Hot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available on "Hot Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between "The London 
EXTD=Years" and "Singles 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-sides, the three remixes and the DVD contained in the box set. \n\nFinal Conclusion: For the completest collector who has to have absolutely everything on CD, you basically have 2 ch
EXTD=oices. Buy all 3 box sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and the two box sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of duplication, though "The London Years" runs a little cheaper than the box sets and you don't have to change CD's a
EXTD=s often). \n\nA slightly cheaper option if you're mainly interested in completing the ABKCO Rolling Stones "canon" not released on the regular studio full-length CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and "Singles 1963-1965". You'd onl
EXTD=y be missing the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper option still, if you're only interested in the very early singles and live EP and can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to buy "More Hot Rocks: Bi
EXTD=g Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1965". With those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Your Plane? and the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\nIn truth, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London Years" make
EXTD=an interesting listen because each is primarily made up of A and B sides not included on the regular studio CD's. So they're almost like listening to independent CD's without repeating too many songs you'll hear when listening to the other albums. The
EXTD=2nd disc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with different selections of songs, so comparing these two further is highly recommended as well. \n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe Stones As The World First Heard Them!, November 16, 2004 \nBy  Robert L. Smith (San Francisco, CA United States]\n\nIn Britain in the 1960s, albums did not occupy the preeminent position in the distribution of popular 
EXTD=music that CDs do today. Most record buyers bought singles (two songs) or EPs ("Extended Plays," 4-5 songs), which were cheaper, and in any case, usually filled in the gap between albums, and featured songs which would not reappear on the LP. Thus, t

EXTD=w experience for me--really do resemble old vinyl records, and the sound quality is absolutely phenomenal! This second set of singles documents a particularly creative period for the band, and is frankly better than its predecessor because (by and la

EXTD=ISFACTION and GET OFF MY CLOUD. They claim thay they have,but it's a farse. The only place you can get the TRUE STEREO versions is on import albums and cd's released overseas in the 70's and 80's. In addition, this box set should be entirely in MONO.
EXTD=All singles during the 60's were released in MONO or SIMULATE STEREO which is also a farse! They might also try releasing some outakes of some of the BIG HITS, or maybe some vintage video during the 60's. They are still the only major band from the 
EXTD=60's that does not have some sort of outakes CD or DVD! The bottom line is we love the packaging,but we have these songs 100 times over..LET'S HEAR OR SEE SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER HEARD OR SEEN BEFORE! WHY MUST WE OBTAIN FAN CLUB CDS AND DVD'S TO HEAR A

EXTD=by acknowledging that I'm one of those people who believe that The Rolling Stones ceased to be relevant after Brian Jones died. So there's that. Also, I bought many of these singles back in the day in the original picture sleeves (including the EPs 
EXTD=which I bought direct from a supplier in England). So seeing them in miniature after all these years (my record collection is long gone) was a treat. Also, I'm basically boycotting those ridiculous Rolling Stones reissue CDs that offer nothing to me 
EXTD=as a consumer that I didn't have on my original LPs 40 years ago. (Man, has it been that long?) So, given all that, I was thrilled when this set was (finally) issued. The years 1965-1967 are (to me) the Golden Age of The Rolling Stones - their artist
EXTD=ic peak years. The songs included in this set are almost all classics. The packaging is fabulously fun. I love the idea of packaging the CDs as miniature versions of the old 45s (much like the earlier Kinks sets) and the booklet is actually informati
