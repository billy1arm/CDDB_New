EXTD=ssential for serious country fans and scholars. Collecting everyth

EXTD=M, the set may have too much music for casual fans,but those willi
EXTD=ng to delve deeply into these 219 tracks will learn much not only 
EXTD=about the duo, but about the evolution of countrymusic in the '50s
EXTD=- many of the roots of contemporary country and rock and roll are

EXTD=xes, four Flatt and Scruggs boxes, and onand on -- the accomplishmen
EXTD=t in putting together this eight-CD 219-track collection of Louvin
EXTD=Brothers recordings may be the label's finest hour. If there were
EXTD=ever a duo that embodied the entirety of the country tradition fr
EXTD=om its folk music and gospel rootsthrough the development of blueg
EXTD=rass and into honky tonk music,it was the Louvins, who have inspir

EXTD=harmony singing to a new level and the creation of full-length al
EXTD=bums far out of the sphereof one or two singles and filler. Whethe
EXTD=r it be in the duets of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton, Gram Pars
EXTD=ons and Emmylou Harris,or the alt-country band Freakwater, the Lou
EXTD=vins are in the stem.Here are contained all of their Capitol, Decc
EXTD=a, MGM, and Apollo sides. All of the concept recordings, such as S
EXTD=atan Is Real, Tragic Songs of Life, and the rest, are here in chro
EXTD=nological order, with complete session notes. In merely listing th
EXTD=e personnel, thereader will be awed at who performed with them: Ow
EXTD=en Bradley, Pete Drake, Don Helms, Chet Atkins, Grandpa Jones, Dal
EXTD=e Potter, Buddy Harman, Jimmy Capps, and the Jordanaires, to name 
EXTD=just a few. Fred Rose was their producer, along with Bradley. And 
EXTD=then the songs -- whether they be traditional Christmas songs like
EXTD="O LittleTown of Bethlehem," broken-hearted love songs such as "I
EXTD=Hear You've Been Cheatin' on Me" and "Love Is a Lonely Street," p
EXTD=atrioticanthems such as "I Died for the Red, White and Blue," or g
EXTD=ospelsongs like "Mother I Thank You for the Bible You Gave Me," th
EXTD=e restless, lonesome ghostly sound of sweetness itself is present.

EXTD=libraries and historians of the music, and for those who can't ge

EXTD=rm, the Louvin Brothers took the sisterly harmonies of the Carter 
EXTD=Family and the brotherly tightness of the Monroe and Callahan brot
EXTD=hers to new, chilling heights. They redefined duo harmony by inter
