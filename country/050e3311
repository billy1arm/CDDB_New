EXTD=and considering the incredible talents on the scene at the time,
EXTD=that is a pretty good indication of just how popular he was, and
EXTD=just how universal John Denver's appeal was. No one else sang of

EXTD=another monster hit he became so famous for. His paeans to appre
EXTD=ciating the beauties of nature and the natural life were modeled 
EXTD=after a much earlier song included in this re-issue of the album,
EXTD=a lovely work called "Whose Garden Was This?". Denver more than 
EXTD=any of his contemporaries actively caught the public's imaginatio
EXTD=n regarding the wonders of the natural environment, and in a time
EXTD=when environmental concerns were splashed all over the headlines
EXTD=and the evening news, John's vision of popular concern for and s
EXTD=tewardship of the natural world was immensely important. This alb
EXTD=um represents a wonderful example of the amazing talents of John,
EXTD=made even as he continued to thrill a whole generation with his 
EXTD=own perspective of a meaningful life lived in the natural splendo
EXTD=r of nature. I know you will enjoy this as well as all of his oth
EXTD=ers. Far out!\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA 1970s Classic,
EXTD=March 5, 2001 \nBy  W. Foley (Canandaigua NY]\n\nThis album was 
EXTD=a good follow up to "Windsong" and there are some great songs her
EXTD=e. I do give it 5 stars but I was not happy with what RCA/BMG did
EXTD=with this CD by putting half of the album "Whose Garden Was This
EXTD=" on it. Having said that, I will concentrate on the music on thi
EXTD=s CD. The song "The Wings That Fly Us Home" is one of the best so
EXTD=ngs John ever did. Back in 1984, as a new fan, I saw him in conce
EXTD=rt and heard the song for the first time and I was amazed at this
EXTD=masterpiece. It has become one of my all time favorites. "Like A
EXTD=Sad Song" is a great example of John doing what he did best...si
EXTD=nging ballads. "Pegasus" and "In The Grand Way" are also good son
EXTD=gs, but "Wrangle Mountain Song" is classic JD. If you're a big fa
EXTD=n of John Denver's music then, by all means you'll need to have t
EXTD=his one too.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA John Denver album
EXTD=a little more contemplative and country, August 1, 2003 \nBy  La
EXTD=wrance M. Bernabo (The Zenith City, Duluth, Minnesota]\n\nJohn De
EXTD=nver had a pretty good year in 1975 with the release of the live 
EXTD=album "An Evening With John Denver," "Rocky Mountain Christmas" f
EXTD=or the holidays, and the popular "Windsong" album. "Spirit," a 19
EXTD=76 release, is a second level John Denver album but one of the be
EXTD=tter ones and an album often overlooked by those expanding their 
EXTD=music collection beyond the greatest hits albums. This is a quiet
EXTD=er album offering contemplative ballads such as "Like a Sad Song"
EXTD=and "In the Grand Way," which were always one of Denver's streng
EXTD=ths as a songwriter. "Spirit" is a bit more country than you usua
EXTD=lly find on a John Denver album (e.g., "Baby, You Look Good to Me
EXTD=Tonight"), \n\nincluding covers of some older country songs that
EXTD=a lot of listeners might not recognize as such (e.g., "San Anton
EXTD=io Rose"). This CD reissue of "Spirit" offers up a quartet of bon
EXTD=us tracks, including one original song by Denver, "The Game Is Ov
EXTD=er," and a surprising couple of Lennon and McCartney songs, "Eleano
EXTD=r Rigby" and "Golden Slumbers," the latter as part of a medley. O
EXTD=nly those who really listened to John Denver know that he did sev
EXTD=eral covers of songs by Paul McCartney, the best of which is stil
EXTD=l "Junk." Adding these treats to the end of "Spirit" makes it a p
EXTD=rime choice for anyone who enjoys Denver's music and wants to get
EXTD=beyond the basics. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe last of
EXTD=his best, August 4, 2005 \nBy  R. Depew (Loveland, CO]\n\nJohn D
EXTD=enver's music defined my life as a teen and a young man. While my
EXTD=friends were into Fraternity of Man, Led Z and Tarkas, John Denv
EXTD=er's music resonated in me and matched the experiences I was havi
EXTD=ng in my life. In my early adult years, beginning with Windsong a
EXTD=nd Spirit, he started moving from easygoing nature boy and peace 
EXTD=advocate into the mystical and more radical side of things. His m
EXTD=usic after Spirit reflected this shift, and I got increasingly di
EXTD=senchanted with it. Someone gave me I Want To Live as a gift, but
EXTD=I think Spirit was the last JD album I bought with my own money.
EXTD=\n\nIn addition, his personal life at the time started clashing 
EXTD=with the public image he had built over the years. The love and f
EXTD=idelity for his wife that he celebrated in "Back Home Again" turn
EXTD=ed out to be a sham. He wrapped his Porsche around a tree (once? 
EXTD=twice?) while speeding drunk along dangerous mountain roads, and 
EXTD=tried many times to beat the ticket -- so much for love of nature
EXTD=, preserving natural resources, respect for fellowman and so on. 
EXTD=When he crashed his plane, he was doing what he loved, but he was
EXTD=doing it with a suspended pilot's license -- suspended because o
EXTD=f his history of drunken driving. \n\nSo JD and I parted company 
EXTD=after Spirit. I didn't even listen to my old albums until after h
EXTD=is death, when my kids started living through the same experience
EXTD=s I'd lived through. Suddenly the old music was relevant again. T
EXTD=elling bedtime stories to my children turned "Pegasus" into somet
EXTD=hing magical, and similarly, tickle fights with the kids in the l
EXTD=iving room redeemed "It Makes Me Giggle". Watching a 13-year-old 
EXTD=boy grow up made "Come and Let Me Look In Your Eyes" suddenly rel
EXTD=evant. Dancing with my daughters brought back images of "Polka Do
EXTD=ts and Moonbeams." Traveling home from business overseas personal
EXTD=ized "Like a Sad Song" and "The Wrangell Mountain Song" (and "Sta
EXTD=rwood in Aspen," surprisingly). And watching my children's spirit
EXTD=ual awakenings evoked, as others have mentioned, the last chorus 
EXTD=of "The Wings that Fly Us Home." \n\nI have no use for "Baby, You
EXTD=Look Good to Me Tonight." (It is good music, written and perform
EXTD=ed well, and it's REALLY fun to parody, but I've grown to associa
EXTD=te it with the later Denver, and so it goes to the bottom of the 
EXTD=Suck-o-Meter, in my opinion.) But the rest of the album is good s
EXTD=tuff, the last of the kind of music that won the hearts of so man
EXTD=y people, made him famous, and made his concerts so much fun. \n\n
EXTD=\nIn reply to an earlier post on Nov. 26, 2008 12:24 AM PST \nD. 
EXTD=Clark says:\n\nYes yes yes! John Denver was just a man and he dea
EXTD=lt with his own personal demons and frailties just as everyone el
EXTD=se does. How many people can truthfully claim they've never gotte
EXTD=n behind the wheel of their cars after one too many drinks? If yo
EXTD=u read his autobiography, he admits to celebrating a little too m
EXTD=uch and wrecking his car around a tree. There are no excuses for 
EXTD=that, but we need to keep in mind that he was vulnerable to the s
EXTD=ame pressures the rest of us are. Yes, he was rich, thanks to his
EXTD=talent, but being rich doesn't always make the issues in life di
EXTD=sappear. He and Annie parted and I think that was a source of pai
EXTD=n for him. He married Cassandra on the rebound and she turned out
EXTD=to be a gold digger looking for someone to further her career. T
EXTD=hat had to hurt once he realized the truth. He even wrote of the 
EXTD=humiliation she brought him. \n\nWhile one can't make make excuse
EXTD=s for the negative things he did, all the positives of his life o
EXTD=utweigh those. He wrote some of the most incredible music of our 
EXTD=time. His voice only got better with age. He cared about and work
EXTD=ed to improve the environment. He put his money where his mouth w
EXTD=as. He brought so much joy to those who listened to his music. Hi
EXTD=s concerts were incredibly moving experiences. \n\nSo, despite hi
EXTD=s weaknesses that seem to be so well documented compared to those
EXTD=of others, he was a good person who made a difference and contin
EXTD=ues to make a difference. He made great music and his songs make 
EXTD=us smile or reflect or cry or wish for a past time in our lives. 
EXTD=He was here and he mattered and he made a difference. How many mo
EXTD=dern musicians will be able to say that? \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOME
EXTD=R REVIEW\nSolid songs bookended by classics, December 22, 2004 \n
EXTD=By  R. Graham (North Carolina]\n\nThis review pertains only to th
EXTD=e 12 songs that comprise the original 'Spirit' (my only commentar
EXTD=y on the bonus tracks from 'Who's Garden Is This?' is that they i
EXTD=llustrate why that album was JD's least successful commercially).
EXTD=I am a huge John Denver fan, but will readily admit that most JD
EXTD=albums contain an equal number of classics, good songs, and thro
EXTD=waways. 'Spirit' is no exception. The album's opener "Come and Le
EXTD=t Me Look In Your Eyes" is one of the great JD album cuts. This i
EXTD=s a song that the general public would not know, but it is a song
EXTD=you should know. A very thoughtful lyric and an immediately catc
EXTD=hy melody. "Eli's Song" and "Wrangell Mountain" are both solid, e
EXTD=specially the former. Without going into them one by one, tracks 
EXTD=4-7 are the weakest songs on the album, especially "It Makes Me G
EXTD=iggle." Track 8, "Baby You Look Good To Me Tonight" is catchy, an
EXTD=d improves with repeated listening. "Like A Sad Song" was the hit
EXTD=off of this album, and while not the 'minor masterpiece' proclai
EXTD=med by the liner notes, it is a very good song and one you will r
EXTD=ecognize. Tracks 10 and 11 are a bit of a lull, and even the firs
EXTD=t bits of the final track, 'The Wings That Carry Us Home' are a b
EXTD=it lumbering. However, the final half, and especially the final m
EXTD=inute, of this last song is among the highlights of the Denver ca
EXTD=non. While it is hard to pick out the best 60 seconds of a 30-yea
EXTD=r career, the last minute of 'The Wings That Carry Us Home' would
EXTD=have to be in the top ten. It is that good. It is beautifully su
EXTD=ng and the lyrics evoke those of the once-performed, never record
EXTD=ed Denver masterpiece "The Wandering Soul." \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUST

EXTD=of them. \n\n\nInitial post: Aug. 13, 2009 6:39 PM PDT \nG. Garn
EXTD=er says:\n\nThe reason John Denver takes so much criticism is pre
EXTD=tty clear, and it has very little to do with him. About 30 years 
EXTD=ago, the pop culture was taken over by a very narrow segment of t
EXTD=he population. The people who are heard on tv and radio, as well 
EXTD=as those who write in the popular magazines, all tend to represen
EXTD=t the fringe elements. It is amazing to what extent the last coup
EXTD=le of generations have been influenced by these people.\n\nBecaus
EXTD=e of their influence, the very last thing anybody seems to want t
EXTD=o be is wholesome or traditional. Of course, John Denver was not 
EXTD=a hypocrite in any substantive sense. He claimed to love his wife
EXTD=and kids-there is no evidence that this was not true. He claimed
EXTD=to love the outdoors and an active lifestyle-again, this appears
EXTD=to have been true in abundance. He claimed to believe certain th
EXTD=ings about how people should live-his actions certainly appear to
EXTD=have borne this out.\n\nTen years before 'We Are the World', he 
EXTD=was honored by the President for his work to alleviate world hung
EXTD=er. Thirty years before it became the hip cause for celebrities, 
EXTD=he championed environmentalism. He wasn't just authentic-he was a
EXTD=pioneer. Anybody can do something once it becomes the 'in' thing
EXTD=of the moment. Denver did these things, for all practical purpos
EXTD=es, alone. \n\nThere is no impressive person you can point to who
EXTD=cannot be criticized for something. Look at George Washington. H
EXTD=e owned slaves, which is deplorable. But, in other respects, he w
EXTD=as nearly as brave, strong, and honest as the old fairy tales wou
EXTD=ld have you believe.\n\nDenver was a strong and dedicated man. Bu
EXTD=t, again, he was just a man. I would much prefer to set high stan
EXTD=dards, and occasionally fall short, than to throw in the towel an
EXTD=d settle for mediocrity. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nFollow
