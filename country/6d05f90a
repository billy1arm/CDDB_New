EXTD=oubled Water hardly sounds like Buck's attempt to court the hippi
EXTD=e audience, but the simple, low-key, and often somber tone of the
EXTD=se tunes is a switch from the up-tempo Bakersfield sound of his b
EXTD=iggest hits. While lyrically "The Devil Made Me Do That" and "Wit
EXTD=hin My Loving Arms" aren't especially far from his usual material
EXTD=, this album has a contemplative undertow that sets it apart from
EXTD=a typical country session of the day, with Don Rich's bright Tel
EXTD=ecaster runs most notable in their absence. "San Francisco Town" 
EXTD=is a surprisingly sympathetic tale of a hippie down on his luck, 
EXTD=while Owens tackles "Love Minus Zero - No Limit" and "Catch the W
EXTD=ind" with both empathy and enthusiasm. And while Buck's version o
EXTD=f "I Am a Rock" is hardly the definitive take on the song, in his
EXTD=hands "Homeward Bound" sounds like a classic tale of a lost soul
EXTD=a long way from home -- in other words, just like a good country

EXTD=2006 \nBy  Todd and In Charge (Miami, FL]\n\nBy 1971 Buck was a 
EXTD=major star, already past the starmaking and career-defining "Bake
EXTD=rsfield sound" that brought him so much fame and attention, and w
EXTD=as deep into consolidating that fame with Hee-Haw and with shrewd
EXTD=California real estate and other business investments. \n\nBuck'
EXTD=s heart was in the right place -- updating his sound, bridging ac
EXTD=ross the deep divide in America at that time between "law and ord
EXTD=er" and the hippies and counter-culture. He laid out his plea to 
EXTD=his fans to accept these sounds and the young people who wrote th
EXTD=em in the original liner notes, which are faithfully reproduced a
EXTD=long with a lavish new set of notes and pictures. \n\nThat said, 
EXTD=those familiar with Buck's music or with the originals covered he
EXTD=re will likely not recognize the way either comes off. Dylan's "L
EXTD=ove Minus Zero" is earnestly sung, yet sounds like nothing you ha
EXTD=ve ever heard. I am a fan of the energetic bass that drives "I am
EXTD=a Rock," despite the bizarre juxtaposition of Buck's vocal deliv
EXTD=ering the lines. And nothing compares to the odd version of Donov
EXTD=an's "Catch the Wind" presented here, with a underlying Moog-like
EXTD=drone, though I have to say it is strangely appealing. Add to th
EXTD=is a few originals, which do sound like late-period Buck, and you
EXTD=have a well-rounded time capsule of Buck stretching, looking for
EXTD=something contemporary, and turning in something that somehow ma
EXTD=nages to work. \n\nNot unlike your great-Uncle crashing your pot 
EXTD=party, you pretty much have to be a fan to truly enjoy. \n\n\nAMA

EXTD=ry folk-pop, December 26, 2004 \nBy  hyperbolium (Earth, USA]\n\n
EXTD=Owens was no late-comer to pop music. Even as he was redefining c
EXTD=ountry music, he was open about his love of '50s rock pioneers an
EXTD=d then-contemporary rock bands like The Beatles. So it's no surpr
EXTD=ise that by the early '70s, with the Bakersfield Sound well-estab
EXTD=lished across numerous albums and tours that Owens would stretch 
EXTD=out in new directions. The result is an album of covers and origi
EXTD=nals that highlight the deep soul of Owens' singing (and the tele
EXTD=pathic harmonizing of The Buckaroos) while disconcerting listener
EXTD=s with its straight-ahead pop sound. \n\nWith "Hee Haw" expanding
EXTD=Owens' audience outside the country mainstream, an album of cont
EXTD=emporary pop by a country superstar must have struck several disp
EXTD=arate chords: outside the mainstream (and to Owens' own regular p
EXTD=roducer, Ken Nelson) it looked like a square attempting to be tre
EXTD=ndy, while blue collar country fans may have wondered where the s
EXTD=teel and telecasters ran off to. But Owens was a canny musician w
EXTD=ho knew that some of the day's best songwriters were writing outs
EXTD=ide the country idiom, and he clearly wanted a chance to sing the
EXTD=ir words. His liner notes suggest that the folk-rock songs of Sim
EXTD=on and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan and Donovan were really "country songs 
EXTD=in disguise." \n\nThe album opens with its highlight, a top-ten c
EXTD=over of "Bridge Over Troubled Water." The Buckaroos pick acoustic
EXTD=guitars and provide angelic harmonies to frame Owens' deeply sou
EXTD=lful vocal. Additional Simon and Garfunkel covers, "Homeward Bound"
EXTD=and "I Am a Rock," don't fit as snugly, with the bright, snap be
EXTD=at of the latter at odds with the angry lyrics. Similarly, Donova
EXTD=n's "Catch the Wind" is too busy for its own good. \n\nOwens' fol
EXTD=k-country originals stand tall, including the acoustic-and-dobro 
EXTD="San Francisco Town" that spells a bum's love for a hospitable to
EXTD=wn. It may have been every bit as starry-eyed as The Animals "San
EXTD=Franciscan Nights" and John Phillips' "San Francisco," but there
EXTD='s a bittersweet edge to the melody that makes it a wonderful com
EXTD=panion to Owens earlier "Streets of Bakersfield." Also fine is th
EXTD=e invitation to love "Within My Loving Arms" and the lost love of
EXTD="Everything Reminds Me You're Gone." \n\nThis is not the place t
EXTD=o start one's Buck Owens collection, but for those who've followe
EXTD=d his arc from country and rockabilly neophyte in the '50s to Bak
EXTD=ersfield superstar in the '60s, this is a worthy spin. Owens voic
EXTD=e is never less than compelling, and though the emotions of Dylan
EXTD=and others don't always fit tight, Owens' heart is evidenced in 
EXTD=every song pick and the four originals that are worth the price o
