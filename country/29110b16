EXTD=Anthology: The Warner-Reprise Years - Disc 2 of 2\n2001 Rhino/Warner Bros. Records, Inc.\n\nOriginally Released May 8, 2001\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Rhino's double-disc Anthology concentrates on Emmylou Harris' Reprise recordings, which is a blessing. 
EXTD=Once she left Reprise, she started to delve into "experimental," "atmospheric" recordings a bit too heavily, certainly more than her prior recordings would justify, and it almost obscured her purest talents - that of a singer that carried on the tra
EXTD=dition of, say, Patsy Cline, becoming the greatest country singer of her generation. Since her generation was the rock generation, her path crossed multiple times with singers that weren't strictly country, most notably at the beginning of her caree
EXTD=r, when she sung backing and harmony vocals for the incomparable Gram Parsons. This gave her exposure, and she capitalized upon it by turning in recordings that simultaneously appealed to rock and country artists, finding herself as a tremendous int
EXTD=erpretive singer, somebody that perfectly balanced the divide between classic and contemporary. Rhino's double-disc Anthology perfectly captures that balance and if it has any faults, it's that it illustrates her career a little too well, finding th
EXTD=at her classicist approach was as modern as it was reverent. So, there are moments here that seem a little too studied to be true, but that's an accurate representation of her career, illustrating how she walked the tightrope between genuine country
EXTD=and a scholarly interpretation of it. This will appeal to both factions, as it captures both sides of her personality equally well. That means it might not be the perfect choice to convert doubters, yet it still winds up representing Harris' career
EXTD=remarkably well, perhaps being the one disc for casual fans. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n\nAmazon.com essential recording\nOver the years Emmylou Harris has created an impressive body of work by mixing songs from both the mainstream and the fringe
EXTD=s of country music with well-chosen covers from the worlds of rock, pop, and R&B. Anthology, a 44-song collection drawn from her 17-year tenure at Warner Bros. and Reprise Records, is something of a greatest-hits package and focuses on her charting 
EXTD=country hits. But along with songs like "Beneath Still Waters," "Two More Bottles of Wine," and "Sweet Dreams"--each a country chart-topper--there are a few lesser-known gems like "Here, There and Everywhere" and Rodney Crowell's "I Had My Heart Set
EXTD=on You." On most of the tracks Harris is backed by her Hot Band, arguably the finest country group of its time, whose members over the years have included Crowell, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, James Burton, and Albert Lee. Harris is a fine songwriter 
EXTD=in her own right--"Boulder to Birmingham," her tribute to Gram Parsons, is particularly nice--but the large selection of great versions of other people's songs on Anthology make a strong case that her ability to choose the perfect song to cover is a
EXTD=n even more valuable talent. --Michael Simmons \n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nAlmost Perfect Collection Of Emmylou Harris Classics, April 6, 2003\nReviewer: Matt Coker (Pacifica, CA, USA) \nUnlike many of her country music colleagues in the 1970s, 
EXTD=Emmylou Harris didn't record singles and pad an album around them. She recorded detailed, consistent, expensive, and high-quality albums and pulled the songs with the highest commercial potential for singles. Listening to ANTHOLOGY: THE WARNER/REPRI
EXTD=SE YEARS and comparing it to recordings by other stars of the 1970s and 1980s is a revelation. There is no contest in terms of the quality of songs and the breath-taking beauty and power of the performances. This compilation features six of her #1 h
EXTD=its: "Together Again", "Sweet Dreams", "Two More Bottles Of Wine", "Beneath Still Waters", "(Lost His Love) On Our Last Date", and "To Know Him Is To Love Him". (Her seventh #1, "We Believe In Happy Endings" was originally released on the BMG label 
EXTD=and wasn't licensed for this collection.) I've listened to lots of country music collections lately and found only three or four songs half as incredible as "White Line", "Beneath Still Waters", "Boulder To Birmingham", "Save The Last Dance For Me",
EXTD="Easy From Now On" or "In My Dreams". These songs are just the beginning. ANTHOLOGY features Emmylou Harris' legendary heart breaking ballads "Making Believe", "Beneath Still Waters", "Sweet Dreams", and "On Our Last Date". Her uptempo material is 
EXTD=terrific, just listen and love "In My Dreams", "C'est La Vie", "Two More Bottles Of Wine", "White Line", and "Heaven Only Knows". In addition, its hard not to be impressed by "If I Could Only Win Your Love", "To Know Him Is To Love Him", "That Lovin
EXTD=' You Feelin' Again", "Save The Last Dance For Me", "Here, There And Everywhere", "Boulder To Birmingham", and "Heartbreak Hill". ANTHOLOGY is the beginning of Rhino Records updating the extraordinary Emmylou Harris catalog - a collection of quality
EXTD=music without equal. Emmylou Harris brought the beauty and emotional resonance of traditional music back to a country music era that desperately needed a lesson about its own past. Harris was also the chief leader in bringing rock music's album ori
EXTD=entated approach to a country music audience that had been fed cheaply manufactured LPs reminiscent of pre-Beatles rock records. \nANTHOLOGY is a completely different type of compilation from 1996's excellent PORTRAITS box set. PORTRAITS is a great 
EXTD=collection that highlights Emmylou Harris' artistry, though I find the minimal coverage of the 1982-1987 years disappointing. ANTHOLOGY functions more as a greatest hits collection, its an almost perfect in this matter except that it omits "I Don't 
EXTD=Have To Crawl" from EVANGELINE. Hopefully, EVANGELINE will be issued soon. ANTHOLOGY corrects many of the omissions that were made on the original greatest hits collections, the highly enjoyable PROFILE series. PROFILE II released in 1984 omits "The
EXTD=Boxer", "That Lovin' You Feelin' Again", "I Don't Have To Crawl", "If I Needed You", "Tennessee Rose", "So Sad", "Drivin' Wheel", and "In My Dreams". which were released as singles between 1979-1984 the years that compilation covers. ANTHOLOGY coll
EXTD=ects most of these songs, but in Emmylou Harris' rich catalog the only box set that would work is one that features all her songs. \n\nANTHOLOGY succeeds immensely because it collects most of the singles not featured on PROFILE or PORTRAITS, (the om
EXTD=ission of "I Don't Have To Crawl" does bother me), and all of the songs released as singles after the 1984 release of PROFILE II. It's hard to argue with what's here in terms of hits "If I Could Only Win Your Love", "Sweet Dreams", "Easy From Now On
EXTD=", "Save The Last Dance For Me", "Born To Run", "Pledging My Love", "White Line", "Heartbreak Hill", as ANTHOLOGY is essentially a greatest hits collection, even if Emmylou Harris is recognized for her album artistry. The single versions of "Mister 
EXTD=Sandman" and "Tennessee Rose" are welcome. "Mister Sandman" was re-recorded by Harris after the "TRIO Project" was cancelled. The version with Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton is available on PORTRAITS and (though still not available) EVANGELINE. The
EXTD=version here is featured on PROFILE II, and the song is different. When CIMARRON spent its ten-plus years as a cassette only release, the instrumental ending to "Tennessee Rose" was replaced by the vocal harmony fade-out of the single, which is als
EXTD=o a shorter version. Eminent's exceptional reissue of CIMARRON featured the original version with the instrumental backing as opposed to the vocal harmony ending. I don't know why the collection lists certain tracks: "Sweet Dreams", "I'm Movin' On",
EXTD="On Our Last Date", and "So Sad" as being live versions. If studio versions exist they have yet to be released, ANTHOLOGY features the same "Sweet Dreams" as ELITE HOTEL, PROFILE, and PORTRAITS. On ELITE HOTEL "Sweet Dreams" was one of three live t
EXTD=racks which showcased the Hot Band in concert, LAST DATE which features "I'm Movin' On", "So Sad", and "On Our Last Date" is a live album with the Hot Band. Another notable accomplishment of ANTHOLOGY is the first CD issue of two tracks from THIRTEE
EXTD=N, one of Harris' most underrated recordings, "I Had My Heart Set On You" and "Today I Started Loving You Again". This collection also features five of the six exclusive B-sides Emmylou Harris issued in the early 1980s: "Precious Love", "Fools Thin 
EXTD=Air", "Colors Of Your Heart", "Another Pot O Tea" and "Maybe Tonight". "Precious Love" and "Fools Thin Air" have never been released on CD. Overall ANTHOLOGY is an excellent Emmylou Harris collection. The real place to experience her extraordinary t
EXTD=alent is her catalog of incredible albums, still ANTHOLOGY is a wonderful introduction to one of the most talent artists of all-time.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nTerrific Introduction To Country's Top Vocalist, December 30, 2001\nReviewer: Steve 
EXTD=Vrana (Aurora, NE) \n         \nMy collection included about half of Emmylou Harris's releases on either vinyl or cassette, and when the Portraits box set came out in 1996 I saw it as an excellent opportunity to upgrade to CD. Five years later along

EXTD=B-sides, "Precious Love" and "Fools Thin Air" - and the non-charting single "Colors of Your Heart," written by Rodney Crowell.\n\nDisc-2 only duplicates three tracks from the box set: "In My Dreams," "To Know Him Is to Love Him" and "Heartbreak Hill
EXTD=" The second disc starts with the three singles (all Top 10 country hits) from 1981's Cimarron, including the duet with Don Williams on "If I Needed You." "Another Pot O' Tea" and "Maybe Tonight" are non-album B-sides from "(Lost His Love) On Our L
EXTD=ast Date" (Harris's fifth No. 1) and "I'm Movin' On"--both taken off 1982's live Last Date album. A third single from that album, "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)," is a heartfelt cover of the Everly Brothers classic.\n\nDisc-2 also showcases Har
EXTD=ris as a songwriter. Three singles were extracted from the song cycle The Ballad of Sally Rose. They were "White Line," "Rhythm Guitar" and "Timberline," all co-written with Paul Kennerley who played guitar and co-produced the album with Harris. [Th
EXTD=ey would latter marry in 1987.] "White Line" was the biggest hit peaking at No. 14 in 1985. Harris's last No. 1 was a remake of the Phil Spector-penned "To Know Him Is To Love Him" from the Trio album. Her final top ten was another Harris-Kennerley

EXTD=ther they just don't have good taste, or they just didn't take the time to become familiar with Emmylou's body of work. So many of her gems (Before Believing, Sleepless Nights, Luxury Liner, Pancho and Lefty, Evangeline, Roses in the Snow, Millworker,
EXTD=Born to Run, A River for Him, Icy Blue Heart, Gulf Coast Highway, No Regrets, need I go on...?) have been omitted and songs included that most of us could have done without. Now let's face it...a bad Emmylou song is still better than most other peo

EXTD=at most of our favorite Emmylou songs never made it to the radio.\nIf you're looking for a really fine collection, look for the 3 CD set called 'Profiles'. When I'm in the mood for Emmylou (which, I must confess is quite often) I have a really diffi

EXTD=ck in the 70's I found Harris albums a hit and miss experience. She can sing a great song like "Boulder To Birmingham" and then sing some mediocre version of one song too many.\nI think that the main problem of this anthology is that it is a collect
EXTD=ion of hit singles, every song comes with the highest place it charted. Some of the songs aged well, but as hits go by the fact that they were number 23 in the country charts don't make them classics. That's why we get Townes Van Zandt "If I needed 
EXTD=You" a great song but not a very good version, and we don't get "Pancho and Lefty", that's why "Evangeline" and others are not included while some mediocre songs are.\n\nAnyway I just wanted one dbl Harris CD in my collection (I keep some LP's still
EXTD=, maybe I should listen to them from time to time) and I think this will do. She is one of the greatest singers in country music and a very beautiful lady too.\n\nHalf.com Album Credits\nDolly Parton, Contributing Artist\nDon Williams, Contributing

EXTD=in the first place, and even if they did, they'd surely sound a lot different. In 2001, the smart folks at Rhino Records saw fit to release comprehensive two-disc anthologies of both Harris and Parsons, highlighting the way the pair (separately and

EXTD=neophyte of the breadth of material in the prolific Harris's catalogue. With her fragile, angelic voice, the premier country interpreter takes on the legends of Townes Van Zandt ("If I Needed You"), Paul Simon ("The Boxer"), and George Jones ("Today
EXTD=I Started Loving You Again") and comes out on top, transforming the songs and creating a new country/folk-rock paradigm in the process. Though she borrows from numerous corners of the pop world (rockabilly, R&B, British Invasion, you name it), Harr
EXTD=is's voice is pure country, and the songs end up that much more interesting for having passed through the high-lonesome plains of her vocal talent.\n YEAR: 2001
