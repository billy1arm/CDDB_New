EXTD=ic. The two CD set, produced by seven time Grammy® Winner and Joh
EXTD=n's friend Roger Nichols. John Denver s 1985 tour of the Soviet U
EXTD=nion was historic for many reasons and also paved the way for oth
EXTD=er American artists to perform in the Soviet Union. The recording
EXTD=s, re-discovered in 2002, have been restored, remixed and mastere
EXTD=d for this CD. Also included are liner notes from John's mother a

EXTD=vember 7, 2007 \nBy  W. Foley (Canandaigua NY]\n\nI have been wai
EXTD=ting for an album like this for many years. There is something am
EXTD=azing about a man performing with just his voice and a guitar and
EXTD=being able to cradle the audience in the palm of his hand for tw
EXTD=o hours. In today's musical world filled with glitz and spectacle
EXTD=that is a rare and vanishing quality. But that is and was the am
EXTD=azing talent of John Denver and you get to personally experience 
EXTD=his remarkable gift through this double CD. When this CD was reco
EXTD=rded back in 1985 John had unfairly faded from the limelight. But
EXTD=as this CD demonstrates he had grown as a performer and musician
EXTD=From his peak in popularity in the mid 1970s to the time when t
EXTD=his was recoded John's voice grew stronger and more powerful whil
EXTD=e remaining as crystal clear as ever along with become more emoti
EXTD=onally expressive in its phrasing. If your only experience of Joh
EXTD=n Denver was from his music and TV shows of the 1970s then you ow
EXTD=e it to yourself to listen to this CD and be amazed at how John m
EXTD=atured from being the country boy from Colorado to the humanitari
EXTD=an and global citizen. \n\nJohn's voice soars majestically and te
EXTD=nderly in this ground breaking and historic project that is packe
EXTD=d full with some of the best renditions of his greatest hits. Lis
EXTD=tening to this CD is like having John and his guitars right there
EXTD=with you. It is personal and intimate. On a personal note my fir
EXTD=st John Denver concert was in 1984 and it was just John and his 6
EXTD=and 12 string guitars (plus piano) and the list of songs was alm
EXTD=ost identical to this CD. My last concert was two months before h
EXTD=e died and again it was just John and his guitars. This CD helps 
EXTD=me remember those times and to celebrate the man and his music wh
EXTD=ose message is as needed today as it was back then. So thank you 
EXTD=to Roger Nichols and Ron Deutschendorf for producing this CD and 
EXTD=giving us another chance to hear again a great artist who we all 
EXTD=still miss very much. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA real tr
EXTD=easure for John Denver fans old and new., November 12, 2007 \nBy 
EXTD=Zbodhimama "spiritabroad" (San Diego, CA USA]\n\nIf you ever saw
EXTD=John Denver in concert, this will recreate the thrill of that ex
EXTD=perience. The audio quality is absolutely amazing, and his voice 
EXTD=soars in these historic concerts. The words of his songs have a s
EXTD=pecial meaning and power when you think of them being sung to an 
EXTD=audience of people who were not free, like the words to "I Want t
EXTD=o Live." And there are some works that aren't easy to find, like 
EXTD="Bells of Rhymney," "The Gold and Beyond," and "Peace Poem." Than
EXTD=k you to his family for this special gift. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTO

EXTD=st there ever was!, November 21, 2007 \nBy  M. Donegan (Ireland]\n
EXTD=\nIt is not too often that a John Denver live album hits the mark
EXTD=et so I feel it is just great to have the release of two new live
EXTD=, but quite different collections almost together, now ten years 
EXTD=after his tragic passing in 1997. \n\nThanks to the Deutschendorf
EXTD=family for allowing us to experience some of the magic of John's
EXTD=solo performances in Moscow, Leiningran and Tallin! In truth his
EXTD=voice was never better! \n\nThis stunning 2 disk collection from
EXTD=John's great solo tour of the USSR more than twenty years ago, c
EXTD=omes on the heels of the Australian-released 'In Concert' box set
EXTD=which features 45 previously unreleased tracks from a number of 
EXTD=concerts from the 1980s and the 1990s, where he was supported by 
EXTD=backing singers and musicians. \n\nLive in the USSR features John
EXTD=performing solo and holding his audiences spell-bound as only he
EXTD=and few others could do. He was without doubt one of the greates
EXTD=t live performers ever. Here he holds his audience by the power o
EXTD=f his voice, his guitar and his performance, and without the chat
EXTD=and humour that dominates in the more expensive Australian relea
EXTD=se. Two very different performances showing how amazingly gifted 
EXTD=he was! \n\nFor me these two live albums should be viewed togethe
EXTD=r. He was an amazing performer whether alone or backed by the bes
EXTD=t backing performers. \n\nFor me Live in the USSR is an absolute 
EXTD=must have for anyone who simply wants to know what John Denver wa
EXTD=s all about! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA Must Have For Th
EXTD=e John Denver Fan, May 23, 2008 \nBy  Michael J. Mountain (Virgin
EXTD=ia Beach, Va]\n\nI had the opportunity to see John Denver at the 
EXTD=Warfield Theater in San Francisco during his "A Man and His Music
EXTD=" tour. No backing band. Just John on stage with his guitars and 
EXTD=a piano. It was and still is the most impressive concert I have e
EXTD=ver been to. It takes a lot to successfully pull off a solo perfo
EXTD=rmance such as this. This CD is an excellent representation of th
EXTD=at concert tour. Anyone who considers themself a JD fan MUST buy 
EXTD=this CD. This is John at his finest! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\nWorth The Wait, December 27, 2007 \nBy  R. Graham (North Ca
EXTD=rolina]\n\nWhat John Denver was able to do with just his songs, g
EXTD=uitar, and voice is simply amazing. As his brother Ron writes in 
EXTD=the liner notes, few performers had the courage to perform solo. 
EXTD=JD did it often, and with great result. JD downplayed his playing
EXTD=skills. When he performed with a band, he employed great guitari
EXTD=sts such as James Burton and Pete Huttlinger. But this solo recor
EXTD=ding shows what a great guitarist JD was in his own right. It is 
EXTD=amazing that one person could coax so much out of a single instru
EXTD=ment. John's voice is also in top form in these concerts. \n\nOft
EXTD=en when a great performer dies, or is towards the end of their ca
EXTD=reer, their labels continually reissue "best of" collections with
EXTD=virtually nothing new to offer the true fan. This practice has h
EXTD=appened somewhat with JD, but this recording is different. This C
EXTD=D is the first concert recording of just John and his guitar (and
EXTD=piano on one track). It also features some lesser-known songs th
EXTD=at show that while JD had lost his extreme popularity by the mid-
EXTD=80s, he had not lost his touch. Early 1980s songs such as "Perhap
EXTD=s Love" and "Heart to Heart" stand up well with the better known 
EXTD=classics which are also included on this CD. One song of note is 
EXTD=1984's "It's About Time." While musically very similar to 1982's 
EXTD="Seasons of the Heart" (also included on this CD), it is one of h
EXTD=is strongest songs lyrically. Songs like "It's About Time" and "I
EXTD=Want To Live" show that JD was well ahead of his time when it ca
EXTD=me to concerns about poverty, human conflict, and the environment
EXTD=While Al Gore speaks to your brain, JD had a rare ability to sp
EXTD=eak to your heart. Nowhere is this talent better reflected than o
EXTD=n this great recording. Buy it now! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REV

EXTD=By  G. R. Vollmer (Michigan, USA]\n\nExcellent CD for any John De

EXTD=s the concert progresses. I would highly recommend this cd. \n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDisappointing (but not the music), De
EXTD=cember 27, 2007 \nBy  Megan "celticrose" (Bloomington, Israel]\n\n
EXTD=In 1985 I was a devoted John Denver fan and also a graduate stude
EXTD=nt studying Russian in Leningrad over the summer. I attended two 
EXTD=of the concerts on Denver's Soviet Union tour, in Leningrad and a
EXTD=week later in Moscow. The memories will be with me forever, espe
EXTD=cially since I met Denver afterwards in Moscow. When this CD was 
EXTD=released, I thought this would recapture more of those memories. 
EXTD=\n\nHere is my disappointment: the music is wonderful, as any liv
EXTD=e performance by JD would be, but almost all the intersong commen
EXTD=tary (and its Russian translation) has been cut out. I realize my
EXTD=interest in this is greater than others' may be, but to know he 
EXTD=did these concerts at what was then both literally and figurative
EXTD=ly the other end of the world it would help to be reminded that t
EXTD=here was (at least) a language barrier--it was the barriers that 
EXTD=he was trying to break down. And the producers (Roger Nichols and
EXTD=Denver's brother Ron) didn't just cut out the Russian translatio
EXTD=n--they cut out the English introductions, which are part of the 
EXTD=experience of any concert. This recording would be better if it h
EXTD=ad included the intersong human element--that's what John Denver 
EXTD=was trying to contribute to the end of the Cold War. \n\nI still 
EXTD=have my memories, but this CD set didn't add much to them.
