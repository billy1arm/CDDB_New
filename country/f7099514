EXTD=ased September 15, 1992\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  (Volume One) When 
EXTD=Travis finally got around to releasing a greatest-hits collection
EXTD=, he realized he had almost enough material for two albums. So, a
EXTD=dding two new songs to each, he put them out simultaneously. Volu
EXTD=me one gets the edge for including those first two hits, "1982" a
EXTD=nd "On the Other Hand" - the best of the new songs, "If I Didn't H
EXTD=ave You" - and the shattering "Reasons I Cheat," which proved as e
EXTD=arly as 1986 that Travis could write 'em as well as sing 'em.  --
EXTD=Brian Mansfield\n\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  (Volume Two)   Eleven m
EXTD=ore Travis classics are included here, among them "Diggin' Up Bon
EXTD=es," "Forever and Ever, Amen" and a fabulous remake of Brook Bent
EXTD=on's "It's Just a Matter of Time." The new songs are "Look Heart,
EXTD=No Hands" and "Take Another Swing at Me."   -- Brian Mansfield\n

EXTD=easons I Cheat" and "I Told You So" sound like they come from a b
EXTD=ygone era, Travis makes the subtle steel and fiddle work sound al
EXTD=most secondary to his deep, bottomless vocals. "Honky Tonk Moon" 
EXTD=and "Too Gone Too Long" display Randy's lighter, Texas-swing side
EXTD=, delivered in jazzy, honey-lined tones. One important aspect of 
EXTD=Randy's career is his choice of material. No artist can go wrong 
EXTD=with such well-written, emotional creations as Hugh Prestwood's "
EXTD=Hard Rock Bottom Of Your Heart" and the sharply written love ball
EXTD=ad, "Deeper Than The Holler." Influenced as much by Hank Williams
EXTD=as he was by Merle Haggard and George Jones, Randy effortlessly 
EXTD=chases his music, ropes and ties it - all done in an unhurried, un
EXTD=cluttered style that is truly deeper than any holler.\n\nRandy is
EXTD=a preserver of the traditional country music flame, as proven in
EXTD=his tribute song "Heroes And Friends." From honky tonks and ball
EXTD=ads to upbeat swing numbers, Travis takes control on this greates
