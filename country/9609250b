EXTD=Editorial Reviews\n\nAmazon.com \n\nThis swaggering, tough-singin
EXTD=g Kentucky duo consists of a pair of impassioned but unremarkable
EXTD=singers--Eddie Montgomery (brother of country star John Michael 
EXTD=Montgomery) and his longtime musical associate Troy Gentry. They 
EXTD=deliver a rowdy, whiskey-drenched, antiheroic brand of rocked-up 
EXTD=honky-tonk that unabashedly conjures up memories of Waylon Jennin
EXTD=gs, Hank Williams Jr., and other rough-and-rowdy country "outlaws
EXTD=" of yesteryear. Montgomery and Gentry wear these influences well
EXTD=on serviceable cuts like "Hillbilly Shoes" and "Didn't Your Mama
EXTD=Tell Ya," but do them a disservice on unremarkable ballads like 
EXTD="Trying to Survive" and "If a Broken Heart Could Kill," and on th
EXTD=eir derivative-sounding cover of Charlie Daniels's "All Night Lon
EXTD=g." The utter lack of original material on their debut CD is some
EXTD=what suspect, yet on killer cuts like the painfully confessional 
EXTD="Self Made Man" and the morally insightful "Daddy Won't Sell The 
EXTD=Farm" they do show a few sparks of innovation amid all the ragged
EXTD=honky-tonk smoke and fire. --Bob Allen
