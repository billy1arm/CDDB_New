EXTD=The Pathway of My Life: 1966-1986, Scott B. Bomar quotes somethin
EXTD=g Hank Thompson told his biographer, Warren Kice: "I was never ha
EXTD=ppy with those records and I never thought it was my thing. Nobod
EXTD=y wanted to do my style of music and I never was able to get the 
EXTD=records with Dot that I did with Capitol." Presumably, Thompson h

EXTD=he other three labels he recorded for after leaving Capitol in 19
EXTD=64 -- in a similar low regard and, to an extent, his mild disdain
EXTD=is understandable. The Capitol records he made with his Brazos V

EXTD=c collected on The Pathway of My Life sees Thompson constantly ad
EXTD=justing to the times, first by trimming his group, which reached 
EXTD=14 musicians at its peak, to a core five or six, then allowing pr
EXTD=oducer Joe Allison to sweeten his Western swing with syrupy backi
EXTD=ng vocals -- a questionable idea made distasteful by the decision
EXTD=to have the singers mimic steel guitar lines. Allison added thes
EXTD=e sugary vocals with the intent of polishing Thompson up for the 
EXTD=changing pop charts and it worked, with "On Tap in the Can or in 
EXTD=the Bottle" and "Smoky the Bar" reaching the Top Ten in 1968. Ben

EXTD=ccouterments, as the whittled-down band remains muscular and is s
EXTD=ometimes accentuated by guitarist Merle Travis -- this music is h
EXTD=ard Texas country and, once he parted ways with Allison and moved
EXTD=from Warner to ABC, the purity of his country could easily be he
EXTD=ard. At times, he'd follow the shifting tides of fashion -- it's 
EXTD=disarming to hear fuzz guitars on the Allison-era "But That's All
EXTD=Right" but natural to hear him sing "Behind Closed Doors" -- and
EXTD=sometimes he'd indulge in a bout of nostalgia (he recorded a nic
EXTD=e tribute to the Mills Brothers in the early '70s, and it's fun t
EXTD=o hear him reconnect to his big-band roots), but he generally stu

EXTD=vancing age, and if the productions of the late '70s and early '8
EXTD=0s do sound a little brittle and cheap, the same can't be said of
EXTD=Thompson himself: as this big box proves, he was a warm, robust,

EXTD=nded and includes all his post-Capitol recordings for Warner Bros
EXTD=, Dot, ABC, Churchill, and MCA/Dot during the twenty year period
EXTD=from 1966 through 1986. It was an era when Hank would experiment
EXTD=with new sounds while repeatedly returning to the unparalleled b

EXTD=\nIf one were to completely ignore the achievements of his classi
EXTD=c years on Capitol Records and only consider his career from 1966

EXTD=music success story. He placed twelve LPs on the country album c
