EXTD=Some Days Are Diamonds\n© 1989 RCA/BMG Music\n\nOriginally Released June 1981\nCD Edition Released May 1989\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  This is a very lush and processed sounding recording that includes some of John Denver's later work. Mostly covers and 
EXTD=songs written by other polished songwriters, the material doesn't tread on any magical grounds. The tune "San Francisco Mabel Joy," a story of a 21-year-old Waycross, GA, a farm boy, a jail, and finding refuge and comfort in a California girl, is pro
EXTD=bably the song that expresses the deepest lyrical response. Denver manages to drop in two originals of his own, "Sleepin' Alone" and "Country Love," though the songs don't resemble the high-octane country-rock and well-written folk ballads of old. Th
EXTD=e production of this record is done quite well, with clear resonance and a shade of dynamics ringing through each tune. Perhaps this album may be highly regarded, overworked, and over-produced. The background singers and band are the weakness. Though

EXTD=ril 27, 2002 \nBy  Barron Laycock "Labradorman" (Temple, New Hampshire United States]\n\nI have always enjoyed this album because it shows a bit different side of John Denver's most considerable talents. Unlike most of his other albums, most of the s

EXTD=Diego, CA, USA]\n\nBy the time John Denver recorded "Some Days Are Diamonds," he was already fading in the hearts and minds of the pop culture environmentalism borne in the 1970s. But even though John's enthusiasm for the project was clearly forced,
