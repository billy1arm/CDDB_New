EXTD=d November 12, 1991\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  The 11 years covered in this fi
EXTD=rst of two Don Gibson retrospectives by the German Bear Family label are t
EXTD=he most captivating in his career. Beginning in 1949, Gibson began recordi
EXTD=ng as part of the hillbilly jump band Sons of the Soil for Mercury. From t
EXTD=he moment Gibson's lead vocal comes through the mix it is evident that eve
EXTD=n if he wasn't writing a lot of songs at the time, he was performing them 
EXTD=as if they were his. Early on he issued four tracks, including the undergr
EXTD=ound classic "Automatic Mama," a rockabilly prototype. A year later, Gibso
EXTD=n and His King Cotton Kingfolks were at RCA working with Stephen Sholes and 
EXTD=they issued eight sides that offered a more complex version of the Sons' s
EXTD=tyle of country, bluegrass, and pop, with just a shade of jump thrown in. 
EXTD=In 1952, Gibson moved to Columbia as a solo artist and recorded with Don L
EXTD=aw and Troy Martin, and guitarist Chet Atkins, which is where his mature v
EXTD=oice began to take shape, as evidenced by his first songwriting credit, "N
EXTD=o Shoulder to Cry On," and a smoking version of Johnnie Masters' "Walkin' 
EXTD=in the Moonlight." His chart success was evident, too, placing tracks stea
EXTD=dily in the Top 40 of Billboard's country chart In 1955 Gibson moved again
EXTD=to MGM, where he recorded his first true smash and a bona fide country mu
EXTD=sic classic: "Sweet Dreams." Yet it wasn't until he returned to RCA in 195
EXTD=7 that Gibson made of himself a living legend in recording arguably the gr
EXTD=eatest two-sided single ever issued in the history of the genre: "Oh, Lone
EXTD=some Me" b/w "I Can't Stop Loving You," which sold not only for him, but w
EXTD=as redefined by Ray Charles on his legendary Modern Sounds in Country and 
EXTD=Western Music album. The late MGM period and his reunion with RCA is exhau
EXTD=stively documented here with alternate and unissued takes as well as unrel
EXTD=eased tracks. Gibson was fortunate enough to be a big enough star when pla
EXTD=yers like Floyd Cramer, Atkins, Rusty Kershaw, Buddy Harman, and Bob Moore
EXTD=were redefining the Nashville studio sound. The gospel tracks here -- fro
EXTD=m the albums No One Stands Alone and That Gibson Boy, as well as Sweet Dre
EXTD=ams, which he re-recorded three more times before the end of 1960 -- were 
EXTD=all so far above the bar artistically that it was difficult for critics to
EXTD=define Gibson, hence his crossover into the pop world where he influenced
EXTD=a young Gram Parsons among many others. In all there are 122 tracks on th
EXTD=is four-CD set, and a fine booklet that offers exhaustive and accurate tra
EXTD=ck information and a fine biographical essay. The sound is fine and the pa
EXTD=ckaging, like all of German Bear Family's boxes, is exquisite. But it's in
EXTD=the music that the truth of Gibson's legend is borne out and on CDs two a
EXTD=nd three are where the songwriter finally eclipses the singer, though the 
EXTD=singer remains a force of nature capable of interpreting any song in a per
EXTD=sonal and original way - just check out Gibson's read of Hank Snow's "I'm M
EXTD=ovin' On." This is essential for serious fans of the legendary music and f
EXTD=or any Gibson collector because of its wealth of previously uncollected ma
EXTD=terial. Volume two focuses on the years 1961 to 1968 and contains more gem
EXTD=s, but this is the defining one.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nBEAR FAMILY PROMO ALE
