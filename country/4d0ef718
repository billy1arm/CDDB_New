EXTD=Originally Released May 23, 2006\nSony/BMG Music Entertainment\n"COLUMBIA/LEGACY"\nupc 827969426524\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Usually, when an artist of stature passes, the record company (or companies, and sometimes even family, look at the sad posthumo
EXTD=us legacy of Townes Van Zandt for example) raid the vaults and unearth loadsof embarrassing garbage along with a few gems. Personal File, issued by Sony Legacy, is very different. For starters, other than Hank Williams, there are no artists who have 
EXTD=Cash's stature (arguably not even Jimmie Rodgers). Secondly, this material was not stored in Columbia's vaults but Cash's own. He began recording these songs -- most of disc one, and four songs from disc two -- at home in 1973, for no one but himself
EXTD=The rest come from the his personal file up through 1982. While closing down the studio, museum, and store, John Carter Cash -- a fierce and honorable guardian of his parents' legacies -- invited the folks from Legacy in tosort through the many ree
EXTD=ls of demos, TV appearances, the awarding of honorary degrees, and speeches, and unreleased recordings. They found some tidy white boxes marked "Personal File," and it'sfrom these tapes alone the tunes were drawn. Many of these are old folk songs pas
EXTD=sed on through the ages, some Cash sang as a kid, or heard from his companions: "Some of those old songs that I used to sing when I was a kid I still remember every word to 'em. A lot of 'em from the radio and I learned a lot of 'em from the boys acr
EXTD=oss the road, the Williams boys, there was Guy and Otis Williams and Jack Williams. They didn't play the guitar or anythingbut they sang a little bit and they had a Victrola..." and Cash recalls the names, records, and performers, and then says "Brad
EXTD=ley Kincaid might have sung this song, I can't quite remember....."and then goes on to finish his intro and sing the song "There's a Mother Waiting at Home." He tells stories to introduce the tunes here. This is as close to a private concert as one c
EXTD=ould ever get. The portrait is so intimate the listener is tempted not to breathe. For example, when Cash introduces "Far Away Places," he tells a story of one of the first talent contests he entered (he got only two votes) and thinks back that it mi
EXTD=ght have been his selection of material that did him in, but it was the first song he ever sang in public. You can hear the memories, painful and hopeful, float back into the singer's delivery. His reading here of "Saginaw, Michigan" contains no pere
EXTD=mptory tale, but the song says it all, and Cash brings the intimacy of the tune's tragic narrative to life in the present. Likewise, it's followed by other Northern-themed tunes, "When It's Springtime in Alaska" and "Girl fromSaskatoon," (written by 
EXTD=Cash and Johnny Horton) before launchinginto a devastating read of Robert Service's poem, "Cremation of Sam McGee." "It's All Over" is an original that comes from Cash'searly days and was never recorded properly in the studio. There are songs by the 
EXTD=Louvin Brothers, John Prine ("Paradise"), Doug Kershaw ("Louisiana Man"), and many others. Disc two is a collection of devotional songs, from well-known hymns like "Lily of the Valley," "Farther Along," and "The Way Worn Traveler," to provocative tun
EXTD=es of unknown origin either in authorship or session detail, such as "If Jesus Ever Loved a Woman, (It was Mary Magdalene)"(and this was how many years before the Da Vinci Code?) This tune and its delivery -- as well as its recording quality -- are o
EXTD=pen to speculation as to whether it is actually an original, improvised on the spot, and uncredited because of its controversial nature. There are gorgeous original songs such as "No Earthly Good,""What Is Man?" and the track Greil Marcus' bases his 
EXTD=liner noteson, "A Half a Mile a Day." Marcus does his usual "big-American-dream-hoped-for-via-small-gesture -- of performance" riff here, but it is poetic and moving nonetheless. In sum, this is an utterlywelcome and perhaps necessary addition to the
EXTD=Cash catalog. Thisis history - it's lineage history in a sense, Cash not forgettingthe songs of his childhood or those he wrote for no other reasonthan to write them, or playing numbers by songwriters who were important to him. Personal File is an au

EXTD=his death in 2003. These 49 songs, labeled "Personal File," show him exploring 19th-century parlor tunes, Tin Pan Alley pop, gospel, little-known Cash originals, classic and contemporary country, and even a recitation of Robert Service's poem "The Cr
EXTD=emationof Sam McGee." On many, his spoken introductions reveal personalties to a given number. Cash reprises early country fare like Jimmie Rodgers's "My Mother Was a Lady" and "The Letter Edged in Black." He also revisits later country classics like
EXTD=the Louvin Brothers' "When I Stop Dreaming," close friend Johnny Horton's hit "When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)," John Prine's "Paradise," and stepdaughter Carlene Carter's "It Takes One to Know Me." The second disc is a virtual hym

EXTD=pe on these long-lost home tapes is that they were unheralded precursors to the stripped-down, raw-boned "American Recordings" series that sent Johnny Cash's cool quotient through the roof in the 1990s... In a sense that's true, although I would argu
EXTD=e that these recordings are a different sort of creature altogether... Where the "American" albums were a calculated bid to present Cash as a back-to-basics country avatar, an icon for the college rock scene to revere, these earlier tracks were, as t

EXTD=just that - personal. The sparse arrangements and accompanying stories breathe the true life of Johnny Cash. Too often, a man like Cash is overshadowed by the legend produced by the media, including excellent films like "Walk the Line".With Personal 
EXTD=File, we are allowed to follow Johnny into a darkened studio. We get to hear him pull out his guitar and lead us through a musical journey that sees him come to life in the lyrics and the stories of remembrance. Most of these songs are not the kind t
EXTD=hat would sell an album. Those songs are brought to the singer by A&R experts with dollar signs in their eyes. These songs are life songs and death songs and faith songs. The listener is invited to sit quietly and let the moments sink in. And, they d

EXTD=ldhood, songs he admired that had been written by others, songs that he would later record in more fully formed arrangements. A big chunk came from sessions laid down in July, 1973,when he was 41 years old. \n\nThis new double disc set brings togethe
EXTD=r 49 of those tracks. More than half are from that ten-day burst in the summer of '73. All but two are just Johnny alone withhis guitar - the other two, from 1982, feature an uncredited second guitarist. The characteristic chink-chinka-chink that dist
EXTD=inguished Cash's hits from the '50s through the '70s is nowhere to befound. \n\nDisc one is devoted to story songs, love songs, old favorites--the secular side of John R. Cash. There's the Louvin Brothers' "When I Stop Dreaming," Johnny Horton's "Whe
EXTD=n It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)," John Prine's "Paradise," The Carter Family's "The Winding Stream," Lefty Frizzell's 1964 hit, "Saginaw, Michigan." Many of the songs are prefaced with Cash's remembrances, explaining their origins or t
EXTD=heir importance to him.It's like having Johnny Cash sitting in your living room after dinner, playing guitar, sharing songs and telling stories. Since these are recordings he apparently didn't intend for public consumption, I can't help but wonder wh
EXTD=o he was talking to. Perhaps he envisioned these tapes as some sort of aural time capsule, to be opened after his death. \n\n"Through times of loneliness and heartbreak and despair and sadness," he says in an introduction on the second disc, "I've al
EXTD=ways found that a good song of inspirationwill lift me up, make me feel just a little bit better." \n\nDisc two contains 24 of those inspirational and spiritual songs, half of which are originals. One of my personal favorites is "What on Earth (Will 
EXTD=You Do for Heaven's Sake)," a Cash composition thatfirst appeared on 1974's Ragged Old Flag. Considering the premise of The Da Vinci Code, "If Jesus Ever Loved a Woman" takes on a connotation probably not envisioned by its author, who is unknown, or 
EXTD=the man in black who sings it here: "If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene was the woman that he loved." \n\nThis disc contains a few oft-performed gospel chestnuts--"Life's Railway to Heaven," "In the Sweet Bye and Bye," "Farther Along
EXTD=," "The Lily of the Valley." But for the most part, these are new or little known folk spirituals, delivered in that distinctive bigger-than-life voice that fills each tune with both gravitas and joy.\n\nJohnny Cash was one of those performers whose

EXTD=This CD is comprised of tracksdiscovered after his death in 2003, and largely dates to 1973. Despite being over thirty years old, these songs are technically crisp for the most part, and all are prizes for Cash fans. \n\nTheset is divided by theme: 
EXTD=the first CD is "classic Cash," secularsongs of great diversity much like the rest of his catalog, the big difference being the intimacy of these recordings. These recordings are not slickly edited in a studio, and many feature spoken introductions f

EXTD=if it were, the passion here will leave you breathless. \n\nThe 1st disc consists of so many unheard gems it's hard where to begin. If the morbid sentimentality of "Engineer's Dying Child" doesn't choke you up, there's something wrong with you. Same
EXTD=goes for his take on the Louvin Brothers', "When I Stop Dreaming" and C. Walker's, "Jim, I Wore A Tie Today". In less committed hands, alot of the material here would've come off as mawkish. But not here. Among the orginals, "I Wanted So" is as starkl
EXTD=y personal as it gets. The opening line, " I wanted so to tell that old man, oh so many things" isdelivered with such dignified regret it can't help but hit home.Same goes for the disc's closer, "It Takes One To Know One". A song written by his step-
EXTD=daughter, Carlene that he masterfully makes his own. \n\nWhere disc I is more secular in nature, disc II is dedicated to Cash's oft overlooked Gospel side. But don't let that scare you off. If anything, things get even more powerful. The weariness of
EXTD="Way Worn Traveller" and "Look Unto The East" are undeniable regardless of belief. Themes of Faith and Doubt wrestle throughout but it all comes to a fore with the Cash original, "Sanctified". The way he belts out, " I'm trying to whip the devil, I'm tr
EXTD=ying to get sactified" you can just hear the demons barely kept at bay. \n\nAlong with the Unearthed boxed set, this is an alltoo generous and unexpected offering. But where Unearthed was released with an air of eulogy and epitaph, Personal File is the u
