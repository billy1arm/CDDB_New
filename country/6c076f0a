EXTD=rsion of Brian Wilson's "God Only Knows" is short and intriguing,
EXTD=and it is interesting to hear Farrar create a light environment 
EXTD=for what was such a big production number for "The Beach Boys." "
EXTD=You Ain't Got the Right" is smart country pop, with Newton-John i
EXTD=n excellent voice and showing a remarkable consistency. Barbara K
EXTD=eith's "Free the People" is, in the hands of Delaney and Bonnie, a 
EXTD=wonderfully deep gospel experience. Countrified and given a snapp

EXTD=lance that Bonnie Bramlett breathed into her version. It's the hi
EXTD=ts here, though, which are outstanding, and the bright pop is bet
EXTD=ter suited to the title track than to Barbara Keith's masterpiece
EXTD="If You Love Me Let Me Know" is a great question for lovers who
EXTD=aren't quite sure, and a marvelous bridge from country music to 
EXTD=pop. It might not have the intensity of Tammy Wynette's "Stand By
EXTD=Your Man," but it climbed higher up the charts and, along with K
EXTD=enny Rogers work, helped Nashville find a wider audience. Topping
EXTD=it off by literally owning adult contemporary on the same album 
EXTD=with the ballad "I Love You, I Honestly Love You" is pretty amazi
EXTD=ng when one looks back at how effectively Farrar and Newton-John 
EXTD=set out to conquer the charts, and succeeded. If You Love Me Let 
EXTD=Me Know works on many levels, and is a strong chapter in Olivia's

EXTD=olina]\nI have owned this album on 8-Track tape, Cassette tape, L

EXTD=John's best album. If an Olivia Newton-John CD collection is pla
