EXTD=\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  The consistent quality of Buck Owen's '60s 
EXTD=albums is impressive considering the half-heartedness that typifi
EXTD=ed many albums of the period. Your Tender Loving Care is a CD rei
EXTD=ssue of a 1967 album that was assembled from recordings made at v
EXTD=arious sessions from 1965-1966. Despite the impression that it is
EXTD=a collection of leftovers, the singularity of Owens' stylistic v
EXTD=ision prevents the album from seeming like a hodgepodge. No surpr
EXTD=ises await the faithful, but this is solid material. The disc inc
EXTD=ludes two bonus tracks, single versions of the title song and "Sa
EXTD=m's Place" (both of which were number-one hits). The album tracks

EXTD=ones who kept The Real Thing (as also defined by Lefty Frizzell

EXTD=he gut string guitar playing of Don Rich, all in support of one o

EXTD=plays his forlorn vocal against Brumley's magic steel, augmented
EXTD=by a touch of mandolin, as does a cover of Merle Haggard's "Hous

EXTD=exquisite, the album also offers the band's patented twanging tel
