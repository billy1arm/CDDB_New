EXTD=im. Imagine John Denver, the ever-so charismatic, message-bearing
EXTD=singer/songwriter/prophet, delivering songs with a high-intensit
EXTD=y group of fellow musicians. It is here, during the recording ses
EXTD=sions of Autograph, that Denver pulls out his magic, singing joyo
EXTD=us mountain-music jams and sweet, teary-eyed ballads with his bac
EXTD=kup group, his friends the Sharks. Johnny and the Sharks come thr
EXTD=ough here with grace and pizzazz, delivering messages of laughter
EXTD=, hope, and wisdom through strong folk storytelling. The opening 
EXTD=of the record sustains with rich color and enchantment, attached 
EXTD=to a wistful, lighthearted jam. "Dancing With the Mountains" is c
EXTD=ertainly danceable, as much as "In My Heart" is smooth and easygo
EXTD=ing, ready for the slow-dance scene. "The Ballad of St. Anne's Re
EXTD=el" is filled with texture, percussive wittiness, and vibrant, lo
EXTD=ng-lasting jamming. The Sharks and Denver go airborne during this
EXTD=tune, appearing to soar to higher heights with eagles in cobalt 
EXTD=mountain skies. Denver's merry charisma shines through with delig
EXTD=htful resonance during his yodeling and singing in "Wrangell Moun
EXTD=tain Song," a song about how "time goes by so slowly": a song abo
EXTD=ut the excitement of anticipation. Dashing further away from Denv
EXTD=er's pop-folk rock ballad formula is the hauntingly beautiful tun
EXTD=e "Whalebones and Crosses," a charming, prophetic statement of gr
EXTD=ief, gratitude, and compassion for those sailors and loved ones, 
EXTD=those fallen fathers lost to the perils of sea. "American Child" 
EXTD=rings clear with visions of the icy blue seas of Alaska, and the 
EXTD=adventurous trek of a child to pursue his dreams, to find a sense
EXTD=of solitude and fulfillment. The land of the midnight sun soon u
EXTD=nfolds into the following tune of deep lyrical sentiment, "You Ma
EXTD=y Say the Battle Is Over." "Most men are ruthless, but some will 
EXTD=still weep when the gifts we were given are gone," is a strong st
EXTD=atement of a melody that carries themes of peace, and of those wh

EXTD=, 2003 \nBy  Peter Durward Harris "Pete the music fan" (Leicester
EXTD=England]\n\nMilton Okun was John's producer and mentor for many 
EXTD=years. They worked together on all his albums up to and including
EXTD=this one, released in 1980. Although this was not the last time 
EXTD=they worked together, things were never the same again. Following
EXTD=this album, John experimented with different producers. Some of 
EXTD=these produced great albums, but in a slightly different style. S
EXTD=o this album, Autograph, was the last of its kind.\n\nThe style o
EXTD=f this album is typical of John - rooted in folk but with element
EXTD=s of pop and country, with a bluegrass influence on one or two tr
EXTD=acks. Classifying John's music was never easy but that's how he l
EXTD=iked it. The quality is all that matters, and you get plenty of t
EXTD=hat here, especially with addition of two bonus tracks. They were
EXTD=recorded for possible inclusion in the original album and were c
EXTD=ertainly good enough.\n\nJohn often sang about nature and the env
EXTD=ironment, and this album is packed with such songs. Normally, the
EXTD=se songs are set in the Rockies, but many of the songs on this al
EXTD=bum are set in Alaska (Wrangell mountain song, American child, Wh
EXTD=alebones and crosses). The Rockies are not completely overlooked 
EXTD=they are the setting for The mountain song. Even the love songs
EXTD=generally relate in some way to the environment, as in How mount
EXTD=ain girls can love.\n\nJohn did not record a lot of covers, but h
EXTD=e always chose wisely when he did record them. Here you can here 
EXTD=his outstanding version of Rodney Crowell's Song for the life.\n\n
EXTD=This was not one of John's least commercially successful albums, 
EXTD=but it was only because he was out of fashion at the time. If thi
EXTD=s album had appeared a few years earlier it would have generated 
EXTD=the sales it deserved. It is a classic. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER
EXTD=REVIEW\nHauntingly beautiful, April 28, 2002 \nBy A Customer\n\n
EXTD=Autograph is a wonderful cd...I deeply appreciate John's renditio
EXTD=n of 'Song for the Life' and 'You Say that the Battle is Over' an
EXTD=d 'The Mountain Song'...and the depth of understanding he communi
EXTD=cates in 'Whalebones and Crosses' evokes in the perceptive listen
EXTD=er that same understanding of the truth he is expressing. 'Americ
EXTD=an Child' is a call to each of us (as are so many of John's balla
EXTD=ds)...and the title track "Autograph' is John Denver at his best-
EXTD=expressing the feelings of his heart. I highly recommend this cd
EXTD=-if you are someone who remembers JD for the hit songs only, you
EXTD=are in for a real eye opener into the depth of style, emotion an
EXTD=d messages JD expressed through his music. Autograph has been a f
EXTD=avorite lp and tape of mine for many years...and the cd version is 
EXTD=excellent! \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe album that solid
EXTD=ified John's resolve to the environment!, January 24, 2001 \nBy  
EXTD=Len Jaffe (Springfield, VA United States]\n\nIt is rather interes
EXTD=ting, although many will write it off to sheer coincidence since 
EXTD=John has been gone for more than three years, that this album sho
EXTD=uld appear on compact disc for the first time...now that the Bush
EXTD=Administration is in place and there are, for the first time in 
EXTD=the last eight years, threats being made by the possible new Inte
EXTD=rior Secretary of drilling for oil in Alaska. Coincidence?\n\n"Au
EXTD=tograph" is the album John needed to record, more than any other,
EXTD=to solidify his resolve to protect the environment. Every single
EXTD=one of the songs that appeared on the original release is here, 
EXTD=plus two songs that were recorded at the same time and were added
EXTD=to this package. Only one of them, "On The Wings Of An Eagle", h
EXTD=as the same theme as the rest of the album, although the old Nitt
EXTD=y Gritty Dirt Band favorite, "Dance, Little Jean", is here, too, 
EXTD=and that is great fun.\n\n"Autograph" exudes John's love for all 
EXTD=things natural. Especially prevalent are songs that make people s
EXTD=top and take pause, which is all that John ever wanted any of us 
EXTD=to do. Listen to "Wrangell Mountain Song" or "Whalebones and Cros
EXTD=ses" and ask yourself how we can go into the pristeen raw nature 
EXTD=of the northern hemisphere and start developing it for the finite
EXTD=amount of resources it has. Listen to David Mallett's "You Say T
EXTD=hat The Battle Is Over" and realize that it will never be.\n\nThe
EXTD=band used during this period, circa 1980, was among the best he 
EXTD=ever had. Herb Pedersen, Emory Gordy, James Burton, Jim Horn, Gle
EXTD=n D Hardin, and Hal Blaine are studio masters all who gave John h
EXTD=is strongest musical support of his entire career.\n\nJohn's enti
EXTD=re RCA catalogue has never been released domestically. I think it
EXTD='s possible that RCA may release some limited-edition box arrange
EXTD=ment of all 25 albums on the fifth anniversary of his passing (I 
EXTD=don't know that, it just seems reasonable). Only "Rocky Mountain 
EXTD=Holiday" with the Muppetts has never seen the light of day as a C
EXTD=D anywhere in the world. I wonder what recorded gems still await 
EXTD=in the vaults somewhere. But thank goodness someone had the wisdo
EXTD=m to release this one. Buy this album and really listen to the wo
EXTD=rds, then play it for your friends, and then talk about it. It mi
EXTD=ght be the last chance you have to make John's dream a reality. \n
EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nHere's To Alaska!, March 5, 2001 
EXTD=\nBy  W. Foley (Canandaigua NY]\n\nI first heard this album in 19
EXTD=82 when I really fell in love with John's music. I was 19 then, a
EXTD=nd even though I had liked his music as a kid, it wasn't till tha
EXTD=t year when I really got into all of his music. His career was on
EXTD=the wane but that was a reflection of the changing tide of the m
EXTD=usic scene as a business, not on John as an artist. This is one o
EXTD=f his best works. So it saddened me to learn that this album did 
EXTD=not recieve the comercial success that it deserved.\n\nEven John'
EXTD=s attempt at a song with a disco theme "Dancing With The Mountain
EXTD=s" comes off as authentic with out being glitzy. But the best son
EXTD=gs on the album, in my opinion, are the songs dealing with Alaska
EXTD=John was not just a troubadour for Colorado, but for anywhere m
EXTD=an was abusing nature. Alaska was his home away from home. "Whale
EXTD=bones and Crosses" is simply a masterpiece. Musically it is complex
EXTD=, not to be tackled by an acoustic guitar alone. It has mulitple 
EXTD=key changes and vocally it challenges a singer in a way only John
EXTD=could meet. John re-recorded "Wrangell Mountain Song" from the "
EXTD=Spirit" albulm and I don't think this version is a as good as the
EXTD=other. But it is still a great song. His cover of David Mallett'
EXTD=s tune "The Ballad of St Anne's Reel" is a stand out. You will be
EXTD=transported to that "tiny little town on fair Prince Edward Isle
EXTD=" and the signature fiddle playing that graces the song between t
EXTD=he verses will stay with you long after the song is over. One of 
EXTD=the bonus tracks "On The Wings of An Eagle" is a personal favorit
EXTD=e of mine. It fits with the theme of the Album. Why RCA or John l
EXTD=eft it off the LP in 1980 leaves me scratching my head wondering.
EXTD=One negative remark is the other bonus track, "Dance Little Jean
EXTD=". The Dirt Bands version is more energetic and polished. John's 
EXTD=version seems tired and lack-lusterd and like he was only going t
EXTD=hrough the motions on this one.\n\nOne last note, and it is just 
EXTD=personal whim of mine, I think this album is mistitled. The album
EXTD=was intended to be John's signature to the people, he hated sign
EXTD=ing autographs - too impersonal. But the tittle track is ok, and 
EXTD=thats it - just ok. The song "American Child" is a more powerful 
EXTD=piece and signifies what this album is about, and therefore, I th
EXTD=ink that would be a more appropriate tittle for this CD.\n\n\nAMA
EXTD=ZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe best message sent by John Denver to 
EXTD=the masses!, August 10, 2003 \nBy  Cody "codyc14" (Alliance, Ohio
EXTD=USA]\n\nJohn Denver experienced a string of monster hits prior t
EXTD=o this album. Rocky Mountain High, Take Me Home Country Roads, an
EXTD=d Annie's Song we're all sewn into the public's conscious. My per
EXTD=sonal favorite John Denver album is Windsong because I feel it is
EXTD=one of the best flowing album out there with many commercial hit
EXTD=s, but this one has a different feel. Throughout the entire music
EXTD=al production, one can't help but think the environment played a 
EXTD=crucial roll with John Denver at this time, as it always had. How
EXTD=ever, this album has the feel of a John Denver struggling to make
EXTD=the public aware of ecological and social problems affecting the
EXTD=earth as a whole. The result is a beautiful work of art. My pers
EXTD=onal favorites are How Mountain Girls Can Love, Wrangell Mountain
EXTD=Song (A Remake of a song he did on the Spirit album), You Say Th
EXTD=at the battle is Over, The Mountain Song, and of course, Autograp
EXTD=h. Just from looking at the list of songs, one would expect it wo
EXTD=uld have continued the John Denver jewell of consitency when it c
EXTD=omes to commercial succes, but if the consumer looks at the relea
EXTD=se date, 1980, well, that date pretty much says it all. Excessive
EXTD=ness was the thing to do, as was being cynical. The good news is,
EXTD=the great artists are never truly remembered in their time, age 
EXTD=has done nothing but make this music amazing. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CU
EXTD=STOMER REVIEW\nWOW!, February 7, 2001 \nBy A Customer\n\nI have w
EXTD=aited a long time for this to come out on CD and now I have now f
EXTD=inished my collection. The songs on this CD was very good and you
EXTD=will find them very different than what he done in the past. The
EXTD=older John Denver got, the better he became. I find that I never
EXTD=tire of his songs. I especially like the "The Ballad of St. Anne
EXTD='s Reel". You will NOT be disappointed if you purchase this cd. \n
EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nJohn's Autograph..., February 21,
EXTD=2001 \nBy  Mike (USA]\n\nJohn Denver titled it Autograph, and it
EXTD=may be more of an autograph than he intended. Released in 1980, 
EXTD=as John's popularity was sliding, this may have been his most soc
EXTD=ially pointed ablum yet. The comming of a new president and strai
EXTD=ned world relations threatened his beloved Alaska. In these songs
EXTD=(particularly the original releases) John unleashes a heavy dose
EXTD=of heartfelt concern. American Child captures this concern. The 
EXTD=ballad appeals to the next generation to heal the wounds created 
EXTD=by past... the song has a presence, "Before the machine turned th
EXTD=e blue and the green into something you can't understand...". The
EXTD=theme echos through all of Autograph's compositions. The style d
EXTD=oesn't drift from the typical Denver album, there is a cover of a
EXTD=n older song (How Mountain Girls can Love), and the folksy (yet p
EXTD=erfectly chosen) covers (the Dylan-like You Say the Battle is Ove
EXTD=r and the awesome Whalebones and Crosses). There is a love song, 
EXTD=In My Heart, that tells of his relationship in tough times. This 
EXTD=is, in some sense, a true Autograph of John Denver- a man constat
EXTD=ly in a state of unrest. The style remains the same- except the t
EXTD=one is more of concern. It is a great listen, I recomend it. \n\n
EXTD=\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nAlmost Old Enough to Drink, January
EXTD=26, 2001 \nBy  Too Many Ceedees "2MuchMusic" (Sparks, NV]\n\nWow
EXTD=! Is this recording 21 years old already? This is not Mr. Denver'
EXTD=s best work. But, it is solid mid-1970's pop music from a master 
EXTD=of the genre. Unfortunately, the album was originally released in
EXTD=1980, a few year too late to enjoy great commercial success. The
EXTD=music on the album ranged from traditional Denver pop, to forays
EXTD=deep into bluegrass. Of particular interest is John's cover of J
EXTD=immy Ibbotson's "Dance Little Jean" which is included as a bonus 
EXTD=track. John has often covered Dirt Band tunes and he does this on
EXTD=e well enough. It is just not as good as the original. So now we 
EXTD=John Denver fans can complete our collection of his music on CD. 
EXTD=It has been a long time to wait, but worth it.
