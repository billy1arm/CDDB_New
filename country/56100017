EXTT0=JIMMIE RODGERS\n\n(from AMG]\n\nHis brass plaque in the Country Music Hal
EXTT0=l of Fame reads, "Jimmie Rodgers' name stands foremost in the country mus
EXTT0=ic field as the man who started it all." This is a fair assessment. The "
EXTT0=Singing Brakeman" and the "Mississippi Blue Yodeler," whose six-year care
EXTT0=er was cut short by tuberculosis, became the first nationally known star 
EXTT0=of country music and the direct influence of many later performers from H
EXTT0=ank Snow and Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams to Lefty Frizzell and Merle Ha
EXTT0=ggard. Rodgers sang about rounders and gamblers, bounders and ramblers  a
EXTT0=nd he knew what he sang about. At age 14 he went to work as a railroad br
EXTT0=akeman, and on the rails he stayed until a pulmonary hemorrhage sidetrack
EXTT0=ed him to the medicine show circuit in 1925. The years with the trains ha
EXTT0=rmed his health but helped his music. In an era when Rodgers' contemporar
EXTT0=ies were singing only mountain and mountain/folk music, he fused hillbill
EXTT0=y country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk - and many of his be
EXTT0=st songs were his compositions, including "TB Blues," "Waiting for a Trai
EXTT0=n," "Travelin' Blues," "Train Whistle Blues," and his thirteen blue yodel
EXTT0=s. Although Rodgers wasn't the first to yodel on records, his style was d
EXTT0=istinct from all the others. His yodel wasn't merely sugar-coating on the
EXTT0=song, it was as important as the lyric, mournful and plaintive or happy 
EXTT0=and carefree, depending on a song's emotional content. His instrumental a
EXTT0=ccompaniment consisted sometimes of his guitar only, while at other times
EXTT0=a full jazz band (horns and all) backed him up. Country fans could have 
EXTT0=asked for no better hero/star  someone who thought what they thought, fel
EXTT0=t what they felt, and sang about the common person honestly and beautiful
EXTT0=ly. In his last recording session, Rodgers was so racked and ravaged by t
EXTT0=uberculosis that a cot had to be set up in the studio, so he could rest b
EXTT0=efore attempting that one song more. No wonder Jimmie Rodgers is to this 
EXTT0=day loved by country music fans.\nThe youngest son of a railroad man, Jim
EXTT0=mie Rodgers was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. Following his m
EXTT0=other's death in 1904, he and his older brother went to live with their m
EXTT0=other's sister, where he first became interested in music. Jimmie's aunt 
EXTT0=was a former teacher who held degrees in music and English, and she expos
EXTT0=ed him to a number of different styles of music, including vaudeville, po
EXTT0=p and dance hall. Though he was attracted to music, he was a mischievous 
EXTT0=boy and often got into trouble. When he returned to his father's care in 
EXTT0=1911, Jimmie ran wild, hanging out in pool halls and dives, yet he never 
EXTT0=got into any serious trouble. When he was 12, he experienced his first ta
EXTT0=ste of fame when he sang "Steamboat Bill" at a local talent contest. Rodg
EXTT0=ers won the concert and, inspired by his success, he decided to head out 
EXTT0=on the road in his own travelling tent show. His father immediately track
EXTT0=ed him down and brought him back home, yet he ran away again, this time j
EXTT0=oining a medicine show. The romance of performing with the show wore off 
EXTT0=by the time his father hunted him down. Given the choice of school or the
EXTT0=railroad, Jimmie chose to join his father on the tracks.\n\nFor the next
EXTT0=ten years, Rodgers worked on the railroad, performing a variety of jobs 
EXTT0=along the south and west coasts. In May of 1917, he married Sandra Kelly 
EXTT0=after knowing her for only a handful of weeks - by the fall, they had sepa
EXTT0=rated, even though she was pregnant (their daughter died in 1938). Two ye
EXTT0=ars later they officially divorced, and around the same time, he met Carr
EXTT0=ie Williamson, a preacher's daughter. Rodgers married Carrie in April of 
EXTT0=1920, while she was still in high school. Shortly after their marriage, J
EXTT0=immie was laid off by the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, and he beg
EXTT0=an performing various bluecollar jobs, looking for opportunities to sing.
EXTT0=Over the next three years, the couple was plagued with problems, ranging
EXTT0=from financial to health  the second of their two daughters died of diph
EXTT0=theria six months after her birth in 1923. By that time, Rodgers had begu
EXTT0=n to regularly play in travelling shows, and he was on the road at the ti
EXTT0=me of her death. Though these years were difficult, they were important i
EXTT0=n the development of Jimmie's musical style as he began to develop his di
EXTT0=stinctive blue yodel and worked on his guitar skills.\n\nIn 1924, Jimmie 
EXTT0=Rodgers was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but instead of heeding the docto
EXTT0=r's warning about the seriousness of the disease, he discharged himself f
EXTT0=rom the hospital to form a trio with fiddler Slim Rozell and his sister-i
EXTT0=n-law Elsie McWilliams. Rodgers continued to work on the railroad and per
EXTT0=form blackface comedy with medicine shows while he sang. Two years after 
EXTT0=being diagnosed with TB, he moved his family out to Tucson, Arizona, beli
EXTT0=eving the change in location would improve his health. In Tucson, he cont
EXTT0=inued to sing at local clubs and events. The railroad believed these extr
EXTT0=acurricular activities interefered with his work and fired him. Moving ba
EXTT0=ck to Meridian, Jimmie and Carrie lived with her parents, before he moved
EXTT0=away to Asheville, North Carolina in 1927. Rodgers was going to work on 
EXTT0=the railroad, but his health was so poor he couldn't handle the labor - he
EXTT0=would never work the rails again. Instead, he began working as a janitor
EXTT0=and a cab driver, singing on a local radio station and events as well. S
EXTT0=oon, he moved to Johnson City, Tennessee, where he began singing with the
EXTT0=string band the Tenneva Ramblers. Prior to Rodgers, the group had existe
EXTT0=d as a trio, but he persuaded the members to become his backing band beca
EXTT0=use he had a regular show in Asheville. The Ramblers relented and the gro
EXTT0=up's name took second billing to Rodgers, and the group began playing var
EXTT0=ious concerts in addition to the radio show. Eventually, Rodgers heard th
EXTT0=at Ralph Peer, an RCA talent scout, was recording hillbilly and string ba
EXTT0=nds in Bristol, Tennessee. Jimmie convinced the band to travel to Bristol
EXTT0=, but on the eve of the audition, they had a huge argument about the prop
EXTT0=er way they should be billed, resulting in the Tenneva Ramblers breaking 
EXTT0=away from Rodgers. Jimmie went to the audition as a solo artist and Peer 
EXTT0=recorded two songs  the old standards "The Soldier's Sweetheart" and "Sle
EXTT0=ep, Baby, Sleep"  after rejecting Rodgers' signature song, "T for Texas."
EXTT0=\n\nReleased in October of 1927, the record was not a hit, but Victor did
EXTT0=agree to record Rodgers again, this time as a solo artist. In November o
EXTT0=f 1927, he cut four songs, including "T for Texas." Retitled "Blue Yodel"
EXTT0=upon its release, the song became a huge hit and one of only a handful o
EXTT0=f early country records to sell a million copies. Shortly after its relea
EXTT0=se, Jimmie and Carrie moved to Washington, where he began appearing on a 
EXTT0=weekly local radio show billed as the Singing Brakeman. Though "Blue Yode
EXTT0=l" was success, its sales grew steadily throughout early 1928, which mean
EXTT0=t that the couple weren't able to reap the financial benefits until the e
EXTT0=nd of the year. By that time, Jimmie had recorded several more singles, i
EXTT0=ncluding the hits "Way Out on the Mountain," "Blue Yodel No. 4," "Waiting
EXTT0=for a Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now." On various sessions, Peer exper
EXTT0=imented with Rodgers' backing band, occasionally recording him with two o
EXTT0=ther string instrumentalists and recording his solo as well. Over the nex
EXTT0=t two years, Peer and Rodgers tried out a number of different backing ban
EXTT0=ds, including a jazz group featuring Louis Armstrong, orchestras, and a H
EXTT0=awaiian combo.\n\nBy 1929, Jimmie Rodgers had become an official star, as
EXTT0=his concerts became major attractions and his records consistently sold 
EXTT0=well. During 1929, he made a small film called The Singing Brakeman, reco
EXTT0=rded many songs, and toured throughout the country. Though his activity k
EXTT0=ept his star shining and the money rolling in, his health began to declin
EXTT0=e under all the stress. Nevertheless, he continued to plow forward, recor
EXTT0=ding numerous songs and building a large home in Kerrville, Texas, as wel
EXTT0=l as working with Will Rogers on several fund-raising tours for the Red C
EXTT0=ross that were designed to help those suffering from the Depression. By t
