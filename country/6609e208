EXTD=June 22, 2005\nReviewer: Music_Mastermind "Mosaic" (Northampton, 
EXTD=England]\nI had never heard this album until recently. I'd heard 
EXTD="Dead ringer for love" and loved it. But all I'd heard of the alb
EXTD=um was that it was not half as good at "Bat out of Hell". Well wh
EXTD=at I say to that is that this album is a brilliant follow up to t
EXTD=he album. What were they expecting? An album better than Bat out 
EXTD=of hell? Thats impossible. But anyway, the album starts off with 
EXTD=the brilliant "Peel out", which will be banging in your head for 
EXTD=hours. The next few songs are the ones that get the chorus' stuck
EXTD=in your head. Even though "Read em and weep" is slightly too bal
EXTD=lady, it will still get stuck on your brain! "Everything is permi
EXTD=tted" is perhaps not the best way to end the album. "Dead ringer 
EXTD=for love" would've been quite a finish! Though Meat Loaf's voice 
EXTD=is recognisably more high pitched, you would still associate this
EXTD=album to the artist who made an album that stayed in the UK char

EXTD=ER REVIEW\nDead Ringer, February 7, 2005\nReviewer: Braeden P. Je
EXTD=ffery (Melbourne, VIC Australia]\nJim Steinman's a pretty odd blo
EXTD=ke. Let us not forget that this man - ne, genius - created a rock
EXTD=opera based on Peter Pan. Certainly plausible (the roots of many
EXTD=mythical tales are damn freaky), but clearly insane, Jim Steinma
EXTD=n is a songwriter like no other. Certainly one of the best songwr
EXTD=iters of our age, arguably of all time. \n\n"Dead Ringer" was one
EXTD=of two albums Jim Steinman assembled in 1981, the other being th
EXTD=e definitive "Bad For Good". Both were intended for Meat Loaf, bu
EXTD=t he stormed out of the "BFG" recordings, thus leaving him with "
EXTD=Dead Ringer". And though "BFG" clearly got more than it's fair sh
EXTD=are of the better material, the fact of the matter is that there'
EXTD=s not a bad track on "Dead Ringer". This is one-hundred percent m
EXTD=usical matery. \n\nJim Steinman seperates himself from most music
EXTD=al minds by being truly diverse. You don't normally get this much
EXTD=variety in songs from an album full of different songwriters, mu
EXTD=ch less all on the one. "Dead Ringer" is a roller-coaster ride ta
EXTD=king you from heavy rock through to beautiful love-drenched balla
EXTD=ds and back again (often doing this across the course of each son
EXTD=g) - seven stunning tracks that have to be heard to be believed. 
EXTD=\n\nLet's take, for example, the album's centrepiece (and origina
EXTD=l title-track) "I'll Kill You If You Don't Come Back". This track
EXTD=kicks off with a guitar riff of which most axe-gods would be pro
EXTD=ud (stunning considering it's written by a pianist), launching in
EXTD=to a heavy-rock spectacular that could easily be the stage-stando
EXTD=ut of any rock act on the planet. But then, about halfway through
EXTD=, the song slides from being an angst-rock song into being a powe
EXTD=rful piano-driven ballad. It's two songs - the same tagline, the 
EXTD=same title, but two completely different tracks. And it works. Th
EXTD=is is an example of Steinman's mastery, completely unlike anythin
EXTD=g seen on "Bat Out Of Hell", but definitive in it's own, special 
EXTD=way. \n\nNot all the songs are so varied within themselves, howev
EXTD=er. "Read 'em and Weep" is one of the finest ballads that Steinma
EXTD=n ever wrote, for example. Smacking a bit of "Two Out Of Three Ai
EXTD=n't Bad", to be blatantly honest, but doing it in it's own specia
EXTD=l way, "Read 'em and Weep" is as much of a classic as anything el
EXTD=se that Meat has ever sung, including the stuff on the "Bat" albu
EXTD=ms. It's not a ballad in the most typical sense - not like "Heave
EXTD=n Can Wait" or "For Crying Out Loud" from the 1977 LP - it's got 
EXTD=guitars and drums and the works, but it's still emotionally drive
EXTD=n and quite touching. \n\nThe only other track that really qualif
EXTD=ies as a ballad on this record is the closer, "Everything Is Perm
EXTD=itted". This dark, sinister track, is sometimes not immediately o
EXTD=bvious. It's not immediately brilliant, either, but give it time 
EXTD=and it'll grow on you. This is probably the worst of Meat Loaf's 
EXTD=closers (his albums are known for finishing on highs - "For Cryin
EXTD=g", "Where Angels Sing" being the most obvious standouts), but th
EXTD=at said, it's still a pretty impressive song. "More Than You Dese
EXTD=rve" is, of course, a part of Meat Loaf lore. The version found h
EXTD=ere was actually recorded (or so the liner notes suggest) in 1974
EXTD=, but I'm not so sure about that. At any rate, it's not a song th
EXTD=at I ever really appreciated, and I remain with mixed feelings ab
EXTD=out it today. The version found on "Storytellers" is far superior
EXTD=\n\nFor all these ballads and slower tracks, the album has it's
EXTD=share of explosive rock, as well. "Peel Out", the album opener, 
EXTD=rips along at a rate of knots. People often confuse this song wit
EXTD=h having illusions of "Bat Out Of Hell", but it's nothing of the 
EXTD=sort. They're two completely different songs, and there's no comp
EXTD=arison between them. "Peel Out" never got much in the way of reco
EXTD=gnition, but that doesn't mean it's a bad song. The other, obviou
EXTD=s, rock track on the album is, of course, "Dead Ringer For Love" 
EXTD=itself. This track is a duet with Cher, and, ladies and gentlemen
EXTD=, let me tell you that there's a reason that this was one of Meat
EXTD=Loaf's most successful singles until "I'd Do Anything...". The b
EXTD=and gallop along at one hell of a pace as Meat and Cher exchange 
EXTD=barbs and upleasantries in one of Steinman's better short efforts
EXTD=\n\nWhich leaves just one song. A song that is...well, more or 
EXTD=less indescribable. A song that has a bit of everything. A song t
EXTD=hat (and I better whisper this) is perhaps one of the three best 
EXTD=songs that Meat Loaf ever sang. From it's dark and moody piano an
EXTD=d bass opening, through to it's explosive heavy-guitar climax, "I
EXTD='m Gonna Love Her" is not only musically diverse, but also lyrica
EXTD=lly stunning, as Meat pleads with his best friend to stop mistrea
EXTD=ting the woman they mutually love. He's "gonna love her for both 
EXTD=of" them. And it's a good thing, too. Because if he wasn't so ass
EXTD=ertive, then we wouldn't have this song. It's got a bit of everyt
EXTD=hing. It's epic, but it doesn't feel like it. A true Steinman mas
EXTD=terwork. \n\nSo, where's the inevitable "Bat" comparison? It's no
EXTD=t so inevitable after all. Sure, "Bat Out Of Hell" and "Dead Ring
EXTD=er" are both albums written by Jim Steinman, and sung by Meat Loa
EXTD=f, but in so many ways they're each their own, independent entiti
EXTD=es that it's unfair to compare them. "Dead Ringer" is every bit a
EXTD=s good an album as "Bat". Enjoy it for what it is - don't critici
EXTD=se it for what it isn't. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe very
EXTD=FIRST Meat comeback, and a great way to come back., March 8, 200
EXTD=3\nReviewer: Justin Dillihay "darkpowrjd" (Ohio]\nDead Ringer, th
EXTD=e follow up to the ever-so-successful Bat Out Of Hell, took 4 yea
EXTD=rs for Meat to get out, but it was well worth the wait. Although 
EXTD=it's not the most underrated Meat work ever (that title belongs t
EXTD=o the follow up to this one, Midnight At The Lost And Found). Thi
EXTD=s one was made out as a failure, but you tell me how selling 5 mi
EXTD=llion copies is still a failure. Maybe by the standards Bat made,
EXTD=it was, but Dead Ringer as a standalone effort is a great CD.\nP
EXTD=eel Out is EASILY my favorite energy-lead Meat song of all time, 
EXTD=although this didn't get a good run as a single (I would love to 
EXTD=see what a video for Peel Out would look like today). It is by fa
EXTD=r the best song on the CD with that guitar riff and powerful lyri
EXTD=cs and background vocals. Plus, and I don't think anyone caught t
EXTD=his, but one line is used again in "A Kiss Is A Terrible Thing To
EXTD=Waste." ("Tire tracks and broken hearts./It's all that we're lea
EXTD=ving behind."]\n\nThen Meat mellows out for I'm Gonna Love Her Fo
EXTD=r The Both Of Us, in which the only minor flaw is the length of i
EXTD=t. 7 minutes, and it's easily the longest one on this CD (I'll Ki
EXTD=ll You If You Don't Come Back is close, but not close enough to t
EXTD=op Both Of Us). Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent song, but t
EXTD=he length kind of barrs the overall enjoyment of this song to me.
EXTD=\n\nMore Than You Deserve is the very first song Meat ever sang o
EXTD=f Jim Steinmen's, and Meat delivers this on this one and on I'll 
EXTD=Kill You If You Don't Come Back with theatrical-style lyrics. Rea
EXTD=d Em And Weep, later remade by Barry Manilow, is an excellent bal
EXTD=lad, and it is surprising that Meat and Barry didn't do a duet fo
EXTD=r this song. Here's hoping that the idea hasn't totally escaped e
EXTD=ither of them.\n\nDead Ringer For Love is the centerpiece of this
EXTD=CD. Meat and Cher both get some great voices and lyrics for this
EXTD=one, and this song would later be done with I believe Patti Russ
EXTD=o of his Neverland Express band.\n\nEverything Is Permitted is ja
EXTD=rred by weird lyrics without any point to them, but a interesting
EXTD=rock ballad and closing to Ringer, although you'll be quite lost
EXTD=as to what the hell Meat is talking about here.\n\nWith all of t
EXTD=his, it's hard to believe Ringer didn't do as well as Bat did. Ho
EXTD=wever, it's now that it's FINALLY getting the reconigion it deser
EXTD=ves. Maybe this is what you should be listening to while waiting 
EXTD=for Meat's upcoming work, Couldn't Have Said It Better (due out i
EXTD=n August on US shores). Get Ringer if you haven't already. Don't 
EXTD=compare to Bat, and you'll be alright. Oh, and get Midnight while
EXTD=you're at it to find Meat's TRUE "most underrated album ever."\n

EXTD=Reviewer: Brett Simpson (Auckland, New Zealand]\nDespite stopping
EXTD=at #45 in the US during a very brief chart run, this album went 
EXTD=straight to #1 in the UK and had a top 5 hit single in the form o
EXTD=f "Dead Ringer For Love". It also did very well in most European 
EXTD=countries and Australasia.\nIs it as good as "Bat Out Of Hell"? O
EXTD=f course not...but, in my opinion, it is vastly superior to Bat I
EXTD=I, where Steinman got just a little out of hand with those song l

EXTD=s with Jimmy Iovine, but the albums production credits go to Mr. 
EXTD=Loaf himself, with Stephan Gralphas in a supporting role demonstr
EXTD=ates the friction that nearly prevented the album from ever being
EXTD=finished. Thankfully all parties have done a great job, and an a
EXTD=lbum that could have become a complete shambles is anything but. 
EXTD=\n\nThe backing band (including Billy Joel's long-time drummer Li
EXTD=berty DeVitto on a couple of tracks) is superb, and Steinman deli
EXTD=vers a wide range of lyrical content, which is at it's best when 
EXTD=it is either poignant ("Read 'Em And Weep - and, although I've ha
EXTD=ven't heard it I cannot believe the common consensus that Manilow
EXTD='s version is superior) or tongue-in-cheek ("Dead Ringer For Love

EXTD=Mr. Loaf: "You've got the kind of lips that do more than drink" 
EXTD=Cher: "You've got the kind of mind that does less than think" - i
EXTD=t sounds better with music, honest)The other absolute highlight i
