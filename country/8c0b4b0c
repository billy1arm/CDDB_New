EXTD=The Woman In Me\n© 1995 Mercury Nashville/PolyGram Records, Inc.\n\n\nOriginally Released February 7, 1995\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Sometimes, all it takes for a singer to break it big is to have the right collaborator and nowhere is that truth more ev

EXTD=woman, singing songs that play like tongue-in-cheek empowerment anthems even when they're about heartbreak. She demands that "Any man of mine/better walk the line," tells a poor sap that "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" and when she

EXTD=April 1, 2004 \nBy  J. SHARP (Alabama - United States]\n\n"The Woman In Me" is still the watershed country (yes, country) album of the 1990s and still Shania's best album to date. The hit songs are pure, unadulterated fun. Nothing more, nothing less.
EXTD=There a pair of weak tracks but they are completely overshadowed by the horde of chart-toppers.\n\n"Any Man of Mine" is a perfect example of how to write crowd-pleasing, danceable, and catchy country songs without making them novelty tunes (e.g., "A
EXTD=chy Breaky Heart") or crossover fluff. Its harmonics, hooks, and staccato drums STILL make people move after nearly a decade but it maintains an authentic, even flagrant, country style.\n\nThe ballads are touching, the light-hearted tunes (especially
EXTD="No One Needs to Know") actually lighten the heart, and the [fast] songs really kick. And "God Bless the Child" is a haunting autobiographical coda.\n\nThe reason TWIM remains Shania's best is that it picks one style per song and sticks with it. Muc

EXTD=and Mutt Lange recorded 1995's "The Woman In Me", they had a hard time finding country stations that would play the new album. Twain was told that her music was not country enough, her image was too sexy, and her husband needed to go back to producin
EXTD=g pop and rock records. Once the album was given a chance, it quickly became one of the best-selling country records ever, but while "The Woman In Me" is a favorite of Twain fans everywhere, it has never made it with me. \n\nOne of the things that ma
EXTD=de this album's follow-up, "Come on Over", so successful (and a favorite with me) was its unique blend of country and mainstream music. This one is definitely more country, and since I am not a huge fan of that genre, it has not been one of my top al
EXTD=bums. Some of the songs are a little too raw and twangy for me, including 'Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)' and 'Is There Life After Love?'. And, while Shania's vocals are incredible, Mutt Lange's voice stands out a bit too much on some track
EXTD=s. \n\nHowever, there are some great songs here. I've long been a fan of the fun anthem 'Any Man of Mine' (a precursor to "Come On Over" hit 'Man! I Feel Like A Woman'), and tunes like 'No One Needs to Know Right Now', 'Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been
EXTD=Under', and 'You Win My Love' are light-hearted and fun, combining a bit of rock with their country licks. Romantic ballad 'The Woman In Me' is gentle without being sappy, a true rarity in country music. And hymn 'God Bless the Child' is not only an
EXTD=autobiographic look at Twain's life, but a great statement to hear from anyone. \n\nHit country record? Definitely. Something for Shania's more mainstream fans to love? Maybe. If you are a follower of "Come On Over" and "Up!", you may want to pass o
