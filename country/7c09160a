EXTD=Released August 3, 1987\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: After writing most of 1985's Rhythm and Romance, Cash returned to largely interpretive work on this powerful collection highlighted by Eliza Gilkyson's feminist anthem "Rosie Strike Back" and her father Joh
EXTD=nny Cash's "Tennessee Flat Top Box." -- William Ruhlmann\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: King's Record Shop takes Rosanne Cash closer to rock and pop than any of her past albums, but she still manages to infuse enough of her country charm in a few of the track
EXTD=s to keep it from evolving into a complete crossover. Both her and Rodney Crowell fall precisely into place as a team even though their relationship was suffering. Cash's proficiency can be heard best on the exuberant "Rosie Strikes Back" and to a bi
EXTD=t of lesser extent on "The Real Me." The album itself reached the number six spot, and once again the hits just kept on coming. Four number one singles emerged from the album, with the two best being a cover of John Hiatt's "The Way We Make a Broken 
EXTD=Heart" and a jangly rendition of her father's "Tennessee Flat Top Box." John Stewart's "Runaway Train" is yet another standout, as is the earnest "If You Change Your Mind." Cash's sound is at its fullest, and even on the slower tracks she has more fo

EXTD=Exclusive Review\nHaving stretched the limits of country music into a decidedly pop context on her last album, it now seems like success has caused Rosanne Cash to rethink entirely her approach to the music in her blood. King's Record Shop is destin
EXTD=ed to repeat and expand her commercial inroads, but with an entirely different vision and purpose. She and husband/producer Rodney Crowell have opted for an uncluttered country-rock purity without synthesizers or multi-layered tracks, enlisting some 
EXTD=fine but untraditional songwriting talent, including John Hiatt and Benmont Tench. Supported throughout by superb musicianship, Cash's voice has never sounded better, whether she's rocking out on "Green, Yellow And Red" or crooning on "The Way We Mak
EXTD=e A Broken Heart." Especially jukebox-worthy is the Tench composition, "Why Don't You Quit Leaving Me Alone," ready for "instant classic" recognition in Nashville and beyond. The anti-cliche lyrics and sheer quality of the arrangements make King's Re
EXTD=cord Shop Rosanne Cash's most confident and consistent album. Check out the aforementioned cuts, as well as "Rosie Strikes Back" and "Tennessee Flat Top Box." Great cover, too!!!!! \n© 1978-1999 College Media, Inc. Used by permission. All rights rese
