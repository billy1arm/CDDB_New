EXTD=The sounds of the great vintage guitars and mandolins.\n\nThere is far toomu
EXTD=ch information in the booklet included\nwith this CD to write in here.I di
EXTD=d include David\nGrisman's commentary so that the reader could get an\nide
EXTD=a of the music contained herein....  If you love\nclassic acousticmusic an
EXTD=d vintage instruments, this is\na must have CD....  The booklet is a mini-
EXTD=reference with\nphotographs and historical backgrounds on each instrument.
EXTD=\n\n********\n     Great singers are born with their instruments - acoustic
EXTD=instrumentalists must choose them.  How\ndoes one "select a voice"?  As a
EXTD=novice bluegrass mandolinist in the early '60s, I began to emulate my\nmu
EXTD=sical heroes, Ralph Rinzler, Frank Wakefield, and of course,the great tona
EXTD=l practitioner, Bill\nMonroe.  As I soon learned, they allplayed older Gib
EXTD=son F-5 models.  Soon I was on my own path of tonal\ndiscovery, acquiring 
EXTD=in succession a '60s Kay plywood pawn-shop special, a '20s Gibson A-Junior
EXTD=, a 1919\nGibson F-4, a 1951 Gibson F-5, and finally,a 1924 Gibson Loar F-
EXTD=5.  Each instrument cost a little more\nthan its predecessor and took me a
EXTD=step closer to "my sound."  As I progressed on this journey, I became\nin
EXTD=creasingly enamored with the sounds of these instruments, each with its ow
EXTD=n subtle differences and\npotential.  At that time, terms like "vintage", 
EXTD="Lloyd Loar," and "herringbone," were not associated with\nthe instruments
EXTD=they were simply "used" or "old."  I certainly did not view them as inve
EXTD=stments, or stock\nshares that would soon be splitting.  But I loved them,
EXTD=their tone, feel, smell (probably more due to their\nmusty cases), and vi
EXTD=be.  I still do, but now in 1994 vintage guitars and mandolins are big bus
EXTD=iness.\n\nAs the current market values forthese instruments have expanded 
EXTD=way beyond the means of the\naverage contemporary acoustic musician, somet
EXTD=hing sad (to me) has taken place: more of them are now\nowned by wealthy c
EXTD=ollecters, who have in effect taken them out of circulation.  Many of them
EXTD=sit in\nclosets and glass cases, unplayed and unheard.  The focus has shi
EXTD=fted from the music!\n\nThe purpose of this recording is to redirect some 
EXTD=of the attention being paid to vintage guitars\nand mandolins back to thei
EXTD=r musical values.\n\nWhat do they sound like?  Is one of these instruments
EXTD=worth 10 times more than another,when\nit comes down to the music?  To as
EXTD=sist in this experiment, I invited my friend Tony Rice to lend his\nmaster
EXTD=ly touch to 17 vintage guitars,while I played 17 vintage mandolins.  Dexte
EXTD=r Johnson, a fine\nluthier and proprietor of the acoustic-only Carmel Musi

EXTD=a mini-reference work on a subject that's been dear to my\nheart for over
