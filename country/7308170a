EXTD=Town, Earle found himself sharing a bill with Dwight Yoakum one 
EXTD=night and the Replacements another, and one listen to the album e
EXTD=xplains why -- while the music was country through and through, E
EXTD=arle showed off enough swagger and attitude to intimidate anyone 
EXTD=short of Keith Richards. While Earle's songs bore a certain resem
EXTD=blance to the Texas Outlaw ethos (think Waylon Jennings in "Lones
EXTD=ome, Orn'ry and Mean" mode), they displayed a literate anger and 
EXTD=street-smart snarl that set him apart from the typical Music Row 
EXTD=hack, and no one in Nashville in 1986 was able (or willing) to wr
EXTD=ite anything like the title song, a hilarious and harrowing tale 
EXTD=of life on the road ("Well, I gotta keep rockin' while I still ca
EXTD=n/Got a two pack habit and motel tan") or the bitterly unsentimen
EXTD=tal account of small town life "Someday" ("You got to school wher
EXTD=e you learn to read and write/so you can walk into the county ban
EXTD=k and sign away your life"), the latter of which may be the best 
EXTD=Bruce Springsteen song the Boss didn't write. And even when Earle
EXTD=gets a bit teary-eyed on "My Old Friend the Blues" and "Little R
EXTD=ock 'n' Roller," he showed off a battle-scarred heart that was to
EXTD=ugher and harder-edged than most of his competition. Guitar Town 
EXTD=is slightly flawed by an overly tidy production from Emory Gordy 
EXTD=Jr. and Tony Brown as well as a band that never hit quite as hard
EXTD=as Earle's voice, and Earle would make many stronger and more am
EXTD=bitious records in the future, but Guitar Town was his first shot
EXTD=at showing a major audience what he could do, and he hit a bull'

EXTD=com essential recording \nOn this 1986 debut, Steve Earle burst 
EXTD=on the scene as a fully formed songwriting master, synthesizing e
EXTD=ffortlessly the finest parts of country-folk troubadours like Tow
EXTD=nes Van Zandt and the anthemic, working-class rock of Bruce Sprin
EXTD=gsteen. "Someday," a country-rock masterpiece about a kid stuck p
EXTD=umping gas in a dead-end town, remains the perfect realization of
EXTD=this style, and with the exception of the slight and silly "Litt
EXTD=le Rock 'N' Roller," most everything else here (especially "Hillb
EXTD=illy Highway" and the heartbreaking ballad "My Old Friend the Blu
EXTD=es") comes awfully close. The 2002 reissue, overseen by Earle and
EXTD=original producer Tony Brown, offers fresh remastering, new line

EXTD=arguably his strongest. He's never fit in with the hat acts of th
