EXTD=Originally Released August 20, 2002\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: I Hope You Dance garnered so much critical acclaim that it naturally would be a tough act to follow. But album number four lives up to its predecessor with 13 tracks that calm the soul. Womack
EXTD='s voice is so soothing that the whole listening experience is rather tranquil, peaceful, and serene. It's also pretty ballad-heavy, with Womack pushing her vocal talents to the limit on "Orphan Train" (about feeling like a misfit) and "You Should Ha
EXTD=ve Lied" (about cheating). There does exist a place for a little bit of toe-tapping, up-tempo music on "I Need You" and "Surrender." Otherwise, what you have here is a quiet yet determined album that packs a full punch. Go Lee Ann. -- Maria Konicki D
EXTD=inoia\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nTexas-born Lee Ann Womack made bold new strides with her landmark third album, 2000's I Hope You Dance. With Something Worth Leaving Behind, she's delivered yet another impeccable, mature, and emotionally powerfu

EXTD=r 6 minutes. "When You Gonna Run To Me" reminds me slightly of Dusty Springfield, it's a nice midtempo ballad. "Talk To Me" is a great ballad and should have been edited to fit radio's format. Once again, like on her past albums, Lee Ann covers a few
EXTD=Julie Miller songs. This time she puts her own brand on the uptempo rocker "I Need You", and on the song "Orphan Train" which is the most interesting and unique song among the set here. In my opinion, the best song though is the Matraca Berg written

EXTD=It On Me" and "Closing This Memory Down" are both excellent songs. There's really not one bad song here, although I don't care for the alternate version of the title track. This is a good CD if you give it a chance. She's just trying some new stuff a

EXTD=Reviewer: Lee Armstrong (Winterville, NC United States]\nLee Ann's latest CD is a departure from her previous work, but also an evolution. The CD's grammy-nominated title track is a midtempo # that considers fame and compares Leonardo Da Vinci, Andy

EXTD=still beautiful, but "Something Worth Leaving Behind" is a dull pop-rock crossover exercise with leaden production and songs that are ill-suited to the artist's stylistic strengths. Lee Ann Womack seems to be doing everything she can, both musically

EXTD=A]\nWith this CD, Lee Ann tries waaaaay too hard to emulate the crossover success of "I Hope You Dance". That song was released for what it was, a great, inspirational song and it took off. "Something Worth Leaving Behind", although well-written (by 
EXTD=her bass player Brett Beavers), is being forcibly marketed as a 'career song' - and whether the fans like it or not, producers and the powers that be are grooming Lee Ann to be the next Shania/Faith/Leann pop-crossover artist, they even hired Britney
EXTD=Spears' stylist. Come on! Lee Ann has said many times 'there are two kinds of music - good and bad'. I hate to admit, but she has made some bad choices right here.\n\nWhat happened to "The Fool" and "Never Again, Again" type songs? They have sadly b
EXTD=een replaced by "Let's Surrender" and "When You Gonna Run to Me". And she already had a song called "Talk To Me" (well, a very similarly titled song), it is a bad sign.\n\nThe only standout song on the CD is the Matraca Berg song "You Should Have Lie

EXTD=Zuurbier (Canada]\nLee Ann Womack has always been popular, in many cases. She was commended for staying traditional and keeping country that way, a bold move when most people were crossing over. Through the course of her four albums we've seen an ev

EXTD=such a huge album? For one she didn't mess with the formula which was working, which can be viewed as good or bad, but it works here, why mess with a good thing? The title track in some ways mirrors "I Hope You Dance", its another inspirational song 
EXTD=that hopefully will reach a lot of people as "Dance" did. It's true, much of SOMETHING WORTH LEAVING BEHIND is a grand departure from what we've come to expect from Lee Ann, the album has a more glossed feel to it, more pop sounding on many tracks. V

EXTD=here is a resonance on this album, which is so strong. Yes in the title track, but there's so much behind songs like "I Saw Your Light", "Talk To Me", "Surrender" or "When You Gonna Run To Me", exploring the depths of life and all its aspects. The Ma
EXTD=traca Berg written "You Should've Lied" is pure heaven, one of the album's best. "Surrender" is my personal favorite though, and I believe could really be a success if released. "Orphan Train" is very eerie like, in both its lyrics, vocals and struct

EXTD=odern day classic in every sense. Womack has a reputation for wisely choosing songs, and this album is no different. Many are going to say that she has taken the "pop" road with this new album...like Faith, Shania, etc. Yet, as this album may be her 
EXTD=most pop-sounding-it's still her best album to date. Womack gets better every time. I can't say that about very many artists. This album still has some traditional country sounding tunes, like "He'll Be Back"-you can't get more country than that. But
EXTD=Womack also stretches herself in other musical directions...especially rock. That's shown on the song "I Need You"-a song so full of energy, you can't help but move to it. Another nice thing about this album is that each song has its own sound. Ther
EXTD=e are soft, quiet songs (I Saw Your Light) and faster paced songs like "Surrender". Perhaps the best song on the album is "Blame It On Me" by acclaimed singer/songwriter Bruce Robison. Womack had a cut from him on her previous album called "Lonely To
EXTD=o". He's also the writer of Tim McGraw's "Angry All The Time". He's an amazing writer, and Womack goes for the good stuff. Although I fear that many will dismiss this album as "pop", no one will be able to hear it and say it is "fluff". Each song is
