EXTD=\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Folk Country is chapter number one in the 
EXTD=Waylon Jennings/Chet Atkins partnership that ended up as a series
EXTD=of pitched battles. Folk Country is Waylon's true debut album fo
EXTD=r the RCA label, and while it is very much embryonic in terms of 
EXTD=its revelation of the mature Jennings sound, its roots are clearl
EXTD=y audible and the material, while safe, is more than satisfying. 
EXTD=The single "Stop the World (And Let Me Off)" is indicative of the
EXTD=kind of countrypolitan fare Atkins was developing at the label. 
EXTD=And while this is only 1963, the listener can hear Jennings stret
EXTD=ching the song to its limits -- at least the limits imposed by a 
EXTD=mainstream country single. Also included is a true folk/country s
EXTD=ong, the traditional "Man of Constant Sorrow," on which the song'
EXTD=s hillbilly roots are given a distinctly modern folk sound treatm
EXTD=ent. Also, "Cindy of New Orleans," one of Jennings' first attempt
EXTD=s at writing story-songs, is a curio that works very well as a na
EXTD=rrative with a fine and memorable melody, dressed in trappings of
EXTD=silk around a tale of grit. Jennings was still leaning heavily o
EXTD=n the songs of Harlan Howard, who has no less than four tunes pre
EXTD=sent here, including the classics "Another Bridge to Burn" and "W
EXTD=hat's Left of Me," which open and close the set. Jennings treats 
EXTD=the country songs as modern folk songs while keeping to the middl
EXTD=e of the road, and the folk songs, if indeed there are any aside 
EXTD=from the aforementioned traditional number, are treated in a stri
EXTD=king progressive country fashion without allowing the entirety of
EXTD=the songs or their intents to slip away into the ether. While it
EXTD='s true this is "straighter" than any Jennings date on the label,
EXTD=its songs have aged amazingly well.  -- Thom Jurek\n\nAmazon.com
EXTD=Editorial Review\nWhen this record first emerged in April of 196
EXTD=6, RCA Victor wasn't quite sure how to position Waylon Jennings. 
EXTD=He wasn't quite an outlaw just yet---he was more of a nuisance wh
EXTD=o felt constricted by Nashville's rules. The title of the album, 
EXTD=Jennings's RCA debut, tells you what they decided, although it wa
EXTD=s probably meant more as a disclaimer than a description. Produce
EXTD=d by Chet Atkins, Folk-Country merely hints at the sound that wou
EXTD=ld carry Jennings to stardom in the next decade: Strings and stee
EXTD=l guitars are replaced by strumming acoustics and even harmonica 
EXTD=at times. Still, it has a number of strong cuts, including the hi
EXTD=t "Stop the World (And Let Me Off)," which features a very rock-s
EXTD=ounding electric guitar, Harlan Howard's "What's Left of Me," and
EXTD=the honky-tonk weeper "Now Everybody Knows." --Marc Greilsamer \n

EXTD=(Earth, USA]\nLong before turning outlaw, Jennings cut his debut

EXTD=hough spared some of the era's more syrupy inclinations, this set
EXTD=still finds Jennings a bit constrained by the polished choral vo

EXTD=the standard mid-60s countrypolitan product. Jennings' blend of f
EXTD=olk and country, informed by his time as one of Buddy Holly's Cri

EXTD=s the Chance I'll Have to Take" and "Stop the World (And Let Me O

EXTD=esounds with echoes of Holly, while Howard Harlan's "What Makes a

EXTD=t counting a live recording self-released during his Arizona club
EXTD=days, FOLK-COUNTRY is Jennings' first full album, recorded in 19

EXTD=he was already set apart from the pack by virtue of his unique b

EXTD=Atkins, FOLK-COUNTRY is a relatively straightforward Nashville-s
