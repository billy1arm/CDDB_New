EXTD=less as expected, but there's not a whole lot to separate the tun

EXTD=\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n4.5 stars.... buy this instead of
EXTD=the "Roadrunning" studio album, January 14, 2007\nReviewer: Paul
EXTD=Allaer (Cincinnati]\nIn Spring 06, superstar duo Mark Knopfler (
EXTD=of Dire Straits fame) and Emmylou Harris issued a long anticipate
EXTD=d collaborative album "All the Roadrunning", which for me persona
EXTD=lly was a bit of a let down, as it felt more like a Knopfler solo
EXTD=album that featured Emmylou Harris. Last summer they toured toge
EXTD=ther to promote the album, and this CD/DVD combo, released Novemb
EXTD=er 06, is the result of it. \n\n"Real Live Roadrunning" brings bo
EXTD=th a CD and DVD. As to the CD (14 tracks, 75 min.), it becomes im
EXTD=mediately clear that this is superior to the studio album and fee
EXTD=ls much more like a true collaberative effort. The setlist is of 
EXTD=course heavy on the "Roadrunning" studio album, as it should be, 
EXTD=and there are many stand-outs, like opener "Right Now" and "Red S
EXTD=taggering". There are a couple of Dire Straits tracks as well, bu
EXTD=t even there, Emmylou gets to contribute significantly, none more
EXTD=than on the concert closer "Why Worry", a gem from the "Brothers
EXTD=in Arms" CD (now 20+ years ago), just beautiful. \n\nThe real be
EXTD=auty in this combo is the DVD (130 min.), which brings the concer
EXTD=t in its entirety (something the CD could not do because of CD ti
EXTD=me limitations). Tracks not on the CD include among others "I Dug
EXTD=Up a Diamond", "Born to Run" (no, not the Springsteen song), "So
EXTD=ng for Sonny Listow", and "Belle Star", Emmylou's best contributi
EXTD=on to the "Roadrunning" studio album. Best of all is that the edi
EXTD=ting of the concert maximizes viewing pleasure (PBS-like, compare
EXTD=d to, say, MTV-like), thankfully not changing camera angles every
EXTD=2 seconds or so. The interview and pre-concert bonus features ar
EXTD=e nice (and short), but not essential. \n\nIn all, this is clearl
EXTD=y the better choice if you are tempted to buy "All the Roadrunnin
EXTD=g" studio album. Truly 2 legends at the top of their game. \n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nLoving It, December 28, 2006\nReviewe
EXTD=r: DJW "econofire" (NY]\nI'll confess to not having purchased the
EXTD=Studio version of this Album although I had heard it through a c
EXTD=ouple times. Since the days of the Nelson Mandela 75th birthday c
EXTD=oncert, we Mark Knopfler fans have known that his best work is li
EXTD=ve. So I decided to be patient and wait for the Live version. It 
EXTD=was worth the wait. \n\nMy experience with Emmylou begins with th
EXTD=is Album, so I will leave it up to some of her fans to comment on
EXTD=her, except to say, that I loved the interplay between she and M
EXTD=ark, and it seemed to me that she truly loved the material she wa
EXTD=s working with. Mark, on the other hand seemed comfortable to sta
EXTD=nd back and let the band and Emmylou take the center stage in the
EXTD=music. The final result is a wonder because of it, and the remak
EXTD=e of "why worry" and "romeo and juliet" will have you wondering i
EXTD=f the new versions were the way they were meant to be recorded to
EXTD=begin with. \n\nMark's writing has reached dizzing heights on th
EXTD=is album, both lyrically and muscially, his delivery is unparalle
EXTD=d. From antique staggerwing airplanes to heart broken red dirt gi
EXTD=rls, each song is a bedtime story about simple people simply in l
EXTD=ove with one another. Grand themes like September 11 and Napoleon
EXTD=ic war are mere backround oils for the genuine affection between 
EXTD=a man and woman who bask in the spotlight. Going back to the basi
EXTD=cs in music and lyrics is a common theme these days with several 
EXTD=pop stars touring with acoustic bands, but no one seems more at h
EXTD=ome there than Mark. My only complaint is that some of the lyrics
EXTD=are very hard to distinguish in the audio and you will be reachi
EXTD=ng for the lyrics often wondering "what did she say?'. \n\nIf you
EXTD=missed this tour as I did, the included DVD will do much to help
EXTD=you ammend for your sins. I suggest watching the interview first
EXTD=, then play the jam session next before settling down to watch th
EXTD=e show, otherwise you will miss some important themes in the musi
EXTD=c, and in how it's presented to the audience. A couple of songs a
EXTD=re on the DVD which are not included on the CD also, so make sure
EXTD=you hook up your good speakers for the video. \n\nFinally, if yo
EXTD=u're considering the purchase for yourself then you are most likl
EXTD=ey a Mark Knopfler fan. If you liked "Bring on the Night" and "Sa
EXTD=iling to Philadelphia" then this is the album for you. However, i
EXTD=f you are considering this for a gift, you might better think aga
EXTD=in. This music is hard to tag in terms of genre. At times it soun
EXTD=ds like a true fiddle hoe down, at others it sounds like a tradit
EXTD=ional celtic pipe band, and the next it rocks. Through it all is 
EXTD=masterful lyrics and strings but finding an audience will be diff
EXTD=icult at best. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nPleasure sublime
EXTD=, November 26, 2006\nReviewer: Jonathan Schaefer (los angeles, ca
EXTD=]\n\nRoad Running was basically my first introduction to MK, havi
EXTD=ng been an ELH fan for years. Roadrunning is an excellent cd - pro
EXTD=fessional musicians, great songs and killer duets. When this conc
EXTD=ert came to Gibson it was a spur of the moment thing and before I
EXTD=knew it, I was sitting there. \n\nThis dvd is excellent and well
EXTD=worth the price of the admission. I agree that some shots were l
EXTD=acking but then when I looked back on the concert I couldn't real
EXTD=ly tell they were filming it - where the camers? Well, behind the 
EXTD=stage a good part of the time. \n\nThe sad part of that is that t
EXTD=hey missed the final notes of Speedway at Nazareth which had kill
EXTD=er lighting. This is still my favorite piece from the show and wh
EXTD=at a jaw dropper it was live - great way to be introduced to a new
EXTD=song. Everyone plays together, there is no grandstanding, this i
EXTD=s what professional musicans are about. \n\nI never knew ELH had 
EXTD=such a sense of humor either, she usually just sings flawlessly a
EXTD=nd surrounds herself with the best musicians there are. Her 'high
EXTD=school flashback' was funny. Plus the extras on the dvd are grea
EXTD=t to have, again ELH and her humor, what a treat. \n\nKiller conc
EXTD=ert, professional, taleneted musicians and I do believe that Guy 
EXTD=Fletcher a minor diety. \n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGreat
EXTD=Concert, magnificent sound and disappointing images, November 26
EXTD=, 2006\nReviewer: Martin Meyer (Switzerland]\n\nHaving liked All 
EXTD=the Roadrunning" and having loved seeing Emmylou and Mark perform
EXTD=ing together on stage I couldn't wait to get the Real Live Roadru
EXTD=nning" DVD. The recorded concert is great and the sound is magnif
EXTD=icent. Sadly the same does not apply for the filming of the conce
EXTD=rt. In the middle of a song - even while Emmylou or Mark is still
EXTD=singing - the camera goes behind the band and shows us the stars
EXTD=from behind, which is irritating and spoils the atmosphere. Ofte
EXTD=n the heads of the performing artists are "cut off" and several t
EXTD=imes the images are out of focus. Five stars for Emmylou, five st
EXTD=ars for Mark, five stars for the band, six stars for the crew whi
EXTD=ch gave us the sensational sound and minus four stars for the jer
EXTD=ks who messed up the images and thereby stopped the fans from get
EXTD=ting what could have been a great concert film.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM
EXTD=CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThis Is Us: This Is Them Emmylou and Mark, Nove
EXTD=mber 25, 2006\nReviewer: prisrob "prisrob" (New EnglandUSA]\n\n"A
EXTD=cross a dozen duets, pieced together over seven years Emmylou Har
EXTD=ris and Mark Knopfler sing these tunes with deep emotional overto
EXTD=nes. Much of this CD relates to the life of an itinerant musician
EXTD=, "trying to juggle family and relationships and just the wear an
EXTD=d tear of being in the world". Mark Knopfler \n\nEmmylou says of 
EXTD=making this CD," Mark is very much in control and knows what he w
EXTD=ants, but on the other hand, he understand the mystical process t
EXTD=hat happens when you make a record and that record becomes what i
EXTD=t is. It has everything to do with the people involved, but there
EXTD='s this other ingredient, of something set in motion. When I hear
EXTD=d these songs together, it was so listenable, and I mean that in 
EXTD=the most positive way, It a very rich album, musically and lyrica
EXTD=lly, yet it doesn't requires a lot of work." All of these songs w
EXTD=ere written by Emmylou and Mark. \n\n"Beachcombing" which starts 
EXTD=off the album is evocative of Hurricane Kristina although it was 
EXTD=written well before. It is a song about loss, personal and emotio
EXTD=nal, says Mark, "wreckage washing up all along the coast." \n\n"T
EXTD=his is Us", is selected to become the single of this album. It is
EXTD=infectious and many will relate to this. \n\nA lighter touch com
EXTD=es to "Red Staggewring, which is a Cajun-like tune where lovers c
EXTD=ompare themselves to motorcycles, cars and vintage guitars. \n\nO
EXTD=n "Belle Star", Emmylou compares herself to an old West infamous 
EXTD=female outlaw, "Belle Star" and Mark as Jesse James. This banter 
EXTD=is reminiscent of Johnny and June Cash in their early albums. \n\n
EXTD="Donkey Song' as a song written by Mark and meant for an earlier 
EXTD=CD. They both enjoyed the freedom and silliness. \n\n"Love and Ha
EXTD=ppiness:" is the only "proper" song that Emmylou says she has wri
EXTD=tten. "You cannot always protect your children and this is my hom
EXTD=age to them". \n\n"All the Road Running" paints the picture of th
EXTD=e musician always on the road singing about love found and lost, 
EXTD=missing family and friends, and life in the fast lane. \n\n"If Th
EXTD=is Is Goodbye" came out of 9/11. Mark Knopler talks of reading Ma
EXTD=rtin Amis and Ian McEwan, both of whom he found affecting," I rem
EXTD=ember the McEwan piece honing in on people in the twin towers usi
EXTD=ng their mobiles to make that final phone call home to say "I lov
EXTD=e you, this is goodbye. If there is anything positive to take fro
EXTD=m 9/11, that expression of love is surely it." \n\nThis live CD a
EXTD=nd DVD makes this experience all the more real. Both Emmylou Harr
EXTD=is and Mrk Knopfler are making the best music of their lives, and
EXTD=this CD/DVD stamps the mark of excellence on their efforts. Brav
EXTD=o. \n\nThe underlying emotions, the straight from life sessions, 
EXTD=the day to day existence on the road of this album, is extraordin
EXTD=ary. This Is Them: Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler and now "This
EXTD=Is Us", my best friend. So Highly Recommended. \nprisrob 11/25/0

EXTD=D, November 16, 2006\nReviewer: Albert G. Smith Jr. (Daytona Beac
EXTD=h, Fl USA]\n\nThis set comes as a CD - DVD combo, but after liste
EXTD=ning to (and viewing) the DVD, I can't imagine when I would ever 
EXTD=listen to the CD. There is nothing wrong with it, but the DVD has
EXTD=more songs and when played through a good home theater with DTS 
EXTD=capability, it has an unmatched sound quality. Even if I simply w
EXTD=ish to hear music, I'll load the DVD, set it up to DTS, and then 
EXTD=turn off the TV. This is the quality of sound that makes it clear
EXTD=why we don't just have a DVD player hooked straight into the TV,
EXTD=and why we tolerate a room full of speakers. If you can't decode
EXTD=DTS, you are missing a lot with this DVD. \n\nThe DVD has a mini
EXTD=interview - photo shoot where both Knopfler and Harris talk abou
EXTD=t the project that became their previous album. There are some ot
EXTD=her nice things included, such as a warm-up session where the pla
EXTD=yers all sit around and play acoustically to get into the mind-se
EXTD=t for the show... just a little jam session. \n\nThe actual conce
EXTD=rt was a nice mix of songs from the Knopfler - Harris album, "All
EXTD=the road running" along with some gems from Knopfler's solo work
EXTD=and even a couple of Dire Straits tunes. Knopfler is not stingy 
EXTD=about allowing Harris to sing songs from the back catalog, and so
EXTD=me of the duets from even the Dire Straits era sound like they co
EXTD=uld have been cut for the last project. \n\nA couple of highlight
EXTD=s for me: \n\nSong for Sonny Liston: Wow! This track is a real mi
EXTD=nimalist delight. Mark sits on a chair hits that shuffle and sing
EXTD=s. A bit later some drums and an acoustic upright base come into 
EXTD=the mix. It is feel, rhythm and story, not flash or superficial f
EXTD=luff. Knopfler takes a verse to solo a bit, but this is also unde
EXTD=rstated, yet great. The base player and Mark play off of each oth
EXTD=er and then some more vocals. I kept hitting replay on this song 
EXTD=when I first saw it. \n\nSpeedway at Nazareth: From "Sailing to P
EXTD=hiladelphia", the song is nicely rendered, but I loved the last c
EXTD=ouple of minutes after the singing was finished. The band is simp
EXTD=ly fantastic. It is a real team thing here, with the appearance t
EXTD=hat everyone is soloing at the same time, yet not once is anyone 
EXTD=showing off or walking over the next person. The stage is full of
EXTD=world-class musicians that most people could never name, who are
EXTD=so in sync and meshing perfectly. With no visual cue, they all l
EXTD=and on one single terminal note and the music stops. It is so nic
EXTD=e to see professionals in action. \n\nWhy Worry: This Dire Strait
EXTD=s tune becomes an Emmylou Harris song here. It ends the show, and
EXTD=makes you want more. Terrific. \n\nThere are great bits througho
EXTD=ut the entire concert. Mark does bring out several guitars and wh
EXTD=ile not playing blinding speed runs, he says more these days with
EXTD=a few very well chosen notes than most people can with a hundred
EXTD=It was nice to see him with that thumb - claw style of finger p
EXTD=icking that has become his signature just serving the song, rathe
EXTD=r than showing off. At just over an hour and a half, I never felt
EXTD=it was dragging on too long. An overall great show. \n\nO.K. For
EXTD=the record, aside from my comments above about the CD being less
EXTD=important than the DVD, based on the quality, I did listen to th
EXTD=e CD all of the way through. It is a first rate music disc in eve
EXTD=ryway, and will be nice in a car or office CD player if that is t
EXTD=he only sound system that can be used. If I am home, the DVD will
EXTD=be my first choice, even for audio-only playback. Again, it has 
EXTD=more songs and that 5.1 surround sound from the DTS track makes t
EXTD=his a no brainer for me. \n\n\nHalf.com Details \nProducer: Guy F
