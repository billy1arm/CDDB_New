EXTD=cords\n\nOriginally Released November 20, 2001\n\nAMG EXPERT REVI
EXTD=EW: The Geffen hits were already summarized on Big Ones, so the 2
EXTD=001 collection, Young Lust, takes the next step, providing an "an
EXTD=thology," which apparently means that it delves deeper than those
EXTD=hits, providing two discs of latter-day Aerosmith, including alb
EXTD=um tracks, concert favorites, rarities, non-LP B-sides, and cuts 
EXTD=only available on compilations. A better idea in theory than in p
EXTD=ractice, since Young Lust is typical of collections of its times 
EXTD=in that it simultaneously contains too much music and not enough.
EXTD=Too much because these 34 songs simply constitute a lot of mater
EXTD=ial, especially because there are a few album cuts that aren't pa
EXTD=rticularly distinctive, plus live material at the end that feels 
EXTD=extraneous. Not enough because certain hits aren't here in the hi
EXTD=t versions: the acoustic version of "Livin' on the Edge," the orc
EXTD=hestral version of "Amazing," a live "Falling in Love (Is Hard on
EXTD=the Knees)" (not to mention the live performances of Columbia cl
EXTD=assics "Dream On" and "Sweet Emotion"). That said, this still ful
EXTD=fills its goals pretty nicely, offering an in-depth summary of Ae
EXTD=rosmith's comeback which indeed wasn't limited to just the hits - 
EXTD=cuts like "Hangman Jury," "Monkey on My Back," "Blind Man," and e

EXTD=lbums, or if you have giant gaps in your mid-years Aerosmith coll

EXTD=is a great taste of how far this band has come since the 70s and

EXTD=Love In An Elevator" is an okay song, depends what kind of day yo

EXTD=ing tracks and I suspect it is the disc that makes this set worth
EXTD=getting. The opener, "Eat The Rich" is energetic and lively. The
EXTD=next track is a true Aerosmith gem, a cover of The Doors' "Love

EXTD=me great playing (especially guitarist Joe Perry's take on Robby

EXTD=lso pulls off a great harmonica solo here. It is a fitting tribut
EXTD=e to the spirit of Jim Morrison and the kind of hard rock blues T
EXTD=he Doors helped influence. "Walk On Water" is a crunching Souther
EXTD=n-feeling scorcher. Another great track here is the live version 
EXTD=of "Dream On," like the original it is atmospheric, moving, hypno
EXTD=tic and ultimately a masterpiece in melodic rock virtuosity for A
EXTD=erosmith. There is never anything in modern rock quite like Tyler
EXTD='s vocals and Perry's guitar work. Their influence has not dimini
EXTD=shed and bands like Train, Kid Rock and Metallica have expressed

EXTD=huge Aerosmith fan, but over the years, I've owned several of th

EXTD=bums of all time. In my opinion, that was their most consistent a

EXTD=like "the other side", "what it takes", and "love in an elevator"
EXTD=never wear out their welcome and always manage to bring back mem

EXTD=sual fans like me and I'm really glad for having picked it up. On
EXTD=here, are 34 songs culled from their Geffen years and, in all ho
EXTD=nesty, there really isn't a weak track. I liked the double-live s

EXTD=\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nAs Complete As It Gets, January 18,
EXTD=2002\nReviewer: birddogger5150 (Roseville, MN USA]\n... As I own
EXTD=all of the other Aerosmith CD's on Geffen (except their previous
EXTD=best-of "Big Ones"), I wouldn't pay much more than that for this
EXTD=The only real advantage is the 11 total tracks on here that I d
EXTD=id not already own, most of which are alternate takes, soundtrack
EXTD=cuts, and "B" sides (and they are "B" sides for a REASON). Also,
EXTD=all tracks are digitally remastered, and since I own non-remaste
EXTD=red versions of "Pump", "Get A Grip", etc., this is a plus for me
EXTD=as well. \n\nAs greatest hits CD's go though, this is maybe the 
EXTD=most complete one I've ever seen, and it's not like "Big Ones" wa
EXTD=s overly lacking either. It compiles all of their Geffen-era sing
EXTD=les and throws in key album tracks like "Hangman Jury", "Young Lu
EXTD=st", and "Shut Up And Dance". It's also refreshing to see a few t
EXTD=racks from the much-maligned "Done With Mirrors" here, including 
EXTD=the excellent "Let The Music Do The Talking". It also throws in f
EXTD=our songs from their live "A Little South of Sanity" album, purel
EXTD=y for the purpose of including live versions of four well-known A
EXTD=erosmith songs for which Geffen does not own the rights to the or
EXTD=iginal recordings ("Dream On", "Sweet Emotion", "Hole In My Soul"
EXTD=, "Falling In Love"). \n\nRegarding the otherwise-hard-to-find-st
EXTD=uff, you get a by-the-numbers remake of the Door's "Love Me Two T
EXTD=imes", a somewhat interesting acoustic version of "Living On The 
EXTD=Edge", an orchestral (re: OVERPRODUCED) version of "Amazing", the
EXTD=great ballad "Deuces Are Wild" (from an otherwise lame Beavis and 
EXTD=Butt-Head compilation), two decent (but non-essential) tracks fro
EXTD=m "Big Ones", and ho-hum interchangable B-sides and import-onlys 
EXTD=like "Head First", "Don't Stop", 'Can't Stop Messin'", and "Ain't
EXTD=Enough". You also get the version of "Walk This Way" that Joe Pe
EXTD=rry and Steven Tyler recorded with Run-D.M.C. Say what you will abo
EXTD=ut that song, but it did accomplish two major milestones for bett
EXTD=er or worse - it revived Aerosmith's long-dormant career (for bet
EXTD=ter) while simultaneously ushering rap into the mainstream (for w
EXTD=orse). \n\nIf you're an Aerosmith completist, you will want this 
EXTD=for any songs you don't already have. If you're a casual fan of t
EXTD=heir 80's and 90's work and don't already own many of their album
EXTD=s from "Done With Mirrors" onward, you can look at the track list
EXTD=ings from this and "Big Ones" and decide for yourself which suits
EXTD=you better. Either way, this is a great CD.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOM

EXTD=bums, then you really don't need this collection. There's a coupl
EXTD=e of B-sides, rarities and the Run-DMC version of Walk this Way, 
EXTD=but not enough to warrant getting this set if you have the above-
EXTD=mentioned albums. If you are new to Aerosmith, or on a budget, th
EXTD=en you can't go wrong with this collection. For myself, it was pe
EXTD=rfect as I did not want to spend the money on all the albums that
EXTD=the tracks in this collection come from. So, if economics are a
