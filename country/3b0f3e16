EXTD=Elvis 75: Good Rockin' Tonight - Disc 3 of 4\n© 2009 RCA/Legacy\n
EXTD=\nOriginally Released December 8, 2009\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Nev
EXTD=er once has an Elvis anniversary been missed and his 75th birthda
EXTD=y is indeed a big one, sparking a year-long series of RCA/Legacy 
EXTD=reissues inaugurated by the four-disc box set Elvis 75: Good Rock
EXTD=in' Tonight. Fittingly for a celebration, Elvis 75 doesn't dredge
EXTD=up unreleased items or rarities (there can't be too much left in
EXTD=the vaults anyway), it celebrates the King at his best, telling 
EXTD=the story from beginning to end -- in fact, beginning a little ea
EXTD=rlier with the pre-Sun 1953 acetate of "My Happiness" and ending 
EXTD=a little later, with the 2002 JXL remix of "A Little Less Convers
EXTD=ation." These are somewhat wobbly bookends to what amounts to the
EXTD=best four-disc box retelling of Elvis' familiar story, hitting s
EXTD=o many of the blockbuster hits and great album cuts that it initi
EXTD=ally seems that these 100 songs cover everything essential. Close
EXTD=r inspection naturally reveals there are many masterpieces missin
EXTD=g, whether they're from Sun, the '68 Comeback, or his last single
EXTD="Moody Blue," but the great thing about Elvis 75 is that as it p
EXTD=lays, their absence isn't apparent: it seems to serve up all of P
EXTD=resley's best, and at the very least, it's the best thorough over
EXTD=view of the entirety of his career yet assembled.  -- Stephen Tho
EXTD=mas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description\nHere is a glitt
EXTD=ering collection fit for a king -- in this case, the undisputed, 
EXTD=Once and Future King of Rock 'n' Roll. To commemorate the 75th an
EXTD=niversary of the birth of Elvis Aaron Presley, Elvis 75 - Good Ro
EXTD=ckin' Tonight is the definitive retrospective, a remastered Hot 1
EXTD=00 of Elvis classics in one beautifully-packaged four-CD boxed se
EXTD=t. \n\nSpanning the breadth of Presley's monumental, rags-to-rich
EXTD=es career, Elvis 75 - Good Rockin' Tonight presents an artist who
EXTD=exploded in the mid-1950s, when he shook up a buttoned-down worl
EXTD=d with his mold-breaking music, not to mention his sideburns, swi
EXTD=veling hips, flamboyant wardrobe, and raw sexuality. Until his de
EXTD=ath at 42 in 1977, he would move from rockabilly, rhythm and blue
EXTD=s, bluegrass, and rock 'n' roll to country, pop, gospel, and even
EXTD=to light operatic fare to become one of the greatest and most-be
EXTD=loved entertainers the world has ever known. He would also sell s
EXTD=everal hundred million records. \n\n\nThis definitive set has the
EXTD=chart-topping hits, numbers from his movies, deep cuts from vari
EXTD=ous gold and platinum albums, and exciting in-concert performance
EXTD=s. Featuring rare photographs and an incisive essay by respected 
EXTD=music writer Billy Altman, ELVIS 75 repeatedly demonstrates that,

EXTD=resley's very first recording, "My Happiness," waxed on his own d

EXTD=how he forged hillbilly, blues and country roots into his persona
EXTD=l strand of rock 'n' roll, first for Sun with Scotty Moore and Bi
EXTD=ll Black, and then, with the addition of D.J. Fontana on drums an
EXTD=d A-list guests like Floyd Cramer and Chet Atkins, for RCA. These
EXTD=early works aren't so much primitive as they are elemental - the
EXTD=lack of production pomp or circumstance presents Elvis as an una
EXTD=dorned and raw rock 'n' roll spirit. The addition of a backing vo
EXTD=cal trio, as can first be heard on 1956's "I Was the One," showed
EXTD=a crooning side of Elvis that would continue to reappear even as
EXTD=he continued to explore rockabilly and blues. \n\nFrom the 50s t
EXTD=hrough the 70s Elvis moved through a variety of producer's hands 
EXTD=and a number of different studios, and got something different fr
EXTD=om each. His studio recordings took him from Memphis to Nashville
EXTD=, north to New York, west to Hollywood, back to Nashville where h
EXTD=e worked in RCA's legendary Studio B and back to Memphis for his 
EXTD=legendary late-60s sessions at Chip Moman's American Studios. By 
EXTD=the early '70s, on the heels of his televised comeback special, E
EXTD=lvis once again became a live draw, and selected sides find him i
EXTD=n Las Vegas, Honolulu and on the road in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Elv
EXTD=is waxed his share of clunkers, but with each new direction and i
EXTD=n each new setting he seemed to record something worthwhile, and 
EXTD=producer Ernst Mikael Jorgensen has done a masterful job of picki
EXTD=ng highlights. \n\nMore importantly, Jorgensen has intermixed ico
EXTD=nic hits with lesser known singles and album tracks, showing the 
EXTD=depth of Elvis' artistry and the catalog he created. Elvis often 
EXTD=overwhelmed the charts with hit singles, leaving terrific perform
EXTD=ances such as the energized "One-Sided Love Affair," a bluesy cov
EXTD=er of Lloyd Price's "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" and the gospel "Thrill of
EXTD=Your Love" to languish as album tracks. Even more surprising is 
EXTD=a 1962 version of "Suspicion" that pre-dates Terry Stafford's hit
EXTD=by two years. Elvis' soundtracks included their share of dregs, 
EXTD=particularly as the '60s wore on, but they also included hits and
EXTD=great album tracks like a scorching version of "Trouble" from Ki
EXTD=ng Creole and bluesy covers of Dylan's "Tomorrow is a Long Time" 
EXTD=from Spinout and Jimmy Reed's "Big Boss Man" from Clambake. \n\nW
EXTD=hile other artists reinvented themselves to fit the times, Elvis 
EXTD=bent the times around himself (excepting "Yoga is as Yoga Does," 
EXTD=thankfully not included here), staying true to his voice as every
EXTD=thing around him changed. His producers, songwriters, and musicia
EXTD=ns kept turning over, but in the center of it all Elvis sang a su
EXTD=rprisingly straight line from '53 to '77. Even as his voice matur
EXTD=ed and the productions were influenced by his Vegas stage show, t
EXTD=he fire in his delivery remained. Whether singing rock, blues, co
EXTD=untry, soul, pop or gospel, his performances found a true line st
EXTD=retched from the Sun sessions through RCA studios in Nashville, N
EXTD=ew York and Hollywood, a stint in the army, a catalog of often me
EXTD=diocre films, his 1968 resurrection, a triumphant return to Memph
EXTD=is, and country sessions that brought him back to his roots. \n\n
EXTD=For many listeners, disc four will be the least familiar. Coverin
EXTD=g 1970 through 1977, these selections find Elvis' singles chartin
EXTD=g lower, but still delivering the goods. Only "Burning Love" made
EXTD=the top-5, and his other top-10 from that stretch, "The Wonder o
EXTD=f You," is not included. "An American Trilogy," is at once bombas
EXTD=tic and utterly show-stopping, his version of "Always on My Mind"
EXTD=made the country charts but should have found cross-over success
EXTD=before Willie Nelson ten years later, and his last single, "Way 
EXTD=Down," though given to '70s production sounds, finds his gospel f
EXTD=ervor undimmed. The beat heavy remix of "A Little Less Conversati
EXTD=on" that closes the set shows just how easily Elvis' voice could 
EXTD=slide into new contexts (the original film performance from Live 
EXTD=a Little, Love a Little is worth searching out on DVD, by the way
EXTD=). These hundred tracks aren't a complete run through every Elvis
EXTD=highlight, but they tell the entire arc of his musical career in
EXTD=a compelling and thorough way. \n\nThe box includes an 80-page b
EXTD=ooklet that features a biographical essay by Billy Altman, numero
EXTD=us photos, reproductions of original record labels, covers and pi
EXTD=cture sleeves, movie posters, master tape boxes, and detailed rec
EXTD=ording, chart and personnel data. RCA/Legacy is releasing a compa
EXTD=nion 26-track single disc that cherry-picks this box, and though 
EXTD=it may prove useful as a guide to further Elvis purchases, it doe
EXTD=sn't provide the compelling, detailed portrait of this four-disc 
EXTD=set. With more Elvis 75th-birthday anniversary reissues on the wa

EXTD=Excellent Remastered Set for Fans and Collectors, March 19, 2010 
EXTD=\nBy  Bill Anthony "billjbfan" (North Texas United States]\n\nOth
EXTD=er reviewers have listed many details, and of-course all Elvis fa
EXTD=ns could argue about songs that should or shouldn't be here, but 
EXTD=this box set, remastered by Vic Anesini, has the finest sound eve
EXTD=r, and no overly-loud sound or tampering with mixes either. For t
EXTD=he first time ever, the 1975 hit T-R-O-U-B-L-E has had the glitch
EXTD=in the opening piano chord fixed (it's always sounded like the t
EXTD=ape was dragging or slow for a second on the starting note). The 
EXTD=song selection gets sketchy in the 70's, with many "smaller" hits
EXTD=missing (as well as the top 10 The Wonder Of You being absent), 
EXTD=but it is a great selection overall. \n\nVic Anesini (remastering
EXTD=) has also recently (2006-2010) mastered many excellent budget US
EXTD=reissues of original Elvis albums, some of which have never been
EXTD=on CD or are very rare. Check them out - some of them are: Elvis
EXTD=NOW, Good Times, From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Clambake, Viva La
EXTD=s Vegas, Seperate Ways, Burning Love and Hits From His Movies, Si
EXTD=ngs Hits From His Movies Volume 1, I Got Lucky, Girl Happy, and m
EXTD=ore. He may have also mastered some of the other recent reissues 
EXTD=of Elvis' Camden albums, although he's not listed on the CD's (Al
EXTD=most In Love, Let's Be Friends, Sings Flaming Star, You'll Never 
EXTD=Walk Alone). And, he remastered Elvis' 3 original Gospel Albums o
EXTD=n individual CD's with bonus tracks in 2008 (His Hand In Mine, Ho
EXTD=w Great Thou Art, He Touched Me). Also check out HIT-STORY, where
EXTD=Anesini fixed the mistakes on the first CD from it's original is
EXTD=sue as "30 #1 Hits", and remastered all the tracks on the new 3rd
EXTD=disc. \n\nKeep up the good work, and Sony/BMG - we want to see A
EXTD=LL of Elvis' original albums on CD - including all the soundtrack
