EXTD=She Thinks I Still Care (The Complete United Artists Recordings 1
EXTD=962-64) - Disc 1 of 5\n© 2007 Bear Family Records\n\nOriginally R
EXTD=eleased November 12, 2007\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  George Jones was
EXTD=at United Artists for just three years -- and in those three yea
EXTD=rs he recorded enough music to fill the five discs of Bear Family
EXTD='s She Thinks I Still Care: The Complete United Artists Recording
EXTD=s, 1962-1964. That's an amazing stat in itself, and it becomes ev
EXTD=en more remarkable when you consider that of the 150 songs on thi
EXTD=s box just six are previously unreleased, a miniscule number for 
EXTD=a set this size, testament to how thoroughly the vaults were plun
EXTD=dered, not just via CD reissues but at the time, when new George 
EXTD=Jones albums appeared in a frenzied flood that did not abate unti
EXTD=l after he parted ways with Pappy Daily in the '70s, after a five
EXTD=year stint with Musicor. That stint with Musicor remains largely
EXTD=ignored -- partially due to legal reasons it simply hasn't been 
EXTD=reissued, but as Rich Kienzle points out in his liner notes to th
EXTD=is set, "Musicor grossly over-recorded him," so it's harder to so
EXTD=rt out -- but these UA recordings have almost all seen the light 
EXTD=of day on CD, compiled in a set of highlights for Razor and Tie, wh
EXTD=ich also issued a bunch of these proper albums during the '90s. A
EXTD=s such, there isn't much of a sense of discovery on She Thinks I 
EXTD=Still Care, but discovery often isn't the point of Bear Family bo
EXTD=xes such as these. Context is, and revelations are often present 
EXTD=in how familiar music is presented anew in these sets, and such i
EXTD=s the case with this set. \n\nDuring his time at United Artists, 
EXTD=George started turning into a slicker star than he was at Mercury
EXTD=The productions got bigger, the music got sillier, the packagin
EXTD=g got slicker -- he recycled "White Lightning" as "Root Beer," he
EXTD=did historical numbers in the vein of Johnny Horton, he improbab
EXTD=ly cut a twist number aimed at the rock and roll market, he recorde
EXTD=d Christmas novelties, he sang seemingly countless songs written 
EXTD=by J.P. Richardson, aka the Big Bopper, a pal of Pappy's who prov
EXTD=ided him with countless ditties for his acts to sing. Many of the
EXTD=se made their way to his biggest star, George, and as always it's
EXTD=hard to tell whether Jones chose these songs to sing, or if he j
EXTD=ust sang everything that was presented to him. The sheer number o
EXTD=f sides he cut at UA and Musicor suggests that he simply sang wha
EXTD=tever came his way, exercising his control by directing sessions,
EXTD=making the records as good as they could be. Given the source ma
EXTD=terial, this sometimes resulted in little more than appealing flu
EXTD=ff, but it was appealing, as Jones always sang with conviction, n
EXTD=o matter what kind of song was at hand. \n\nAs She Thinks I Still
EXTD=Care indicates, George sang more poppy material at UA than he di
EXTD=d at Mercury, but sometimes he struck an ideal balance between ha
EXTD=rdcore country and pop, particularly the storming "The Race Is On
EXTD=," a riotous classic that rivaled "She Thinks I Still Care" as hi
EXTD=s biggest hit for UA. Even with these two major crossover hits an
EXTD=d the occasional cornball production, George spent a significant 
EXTD=amount of time at UA cutting purer, harder country music, ranging
EXTD=from a bunch of gospel tunes to outright tributes to such heroes
EXTD=as Hank Williams, Bob Wills, and Little Jimmy Dickens. These tri
EXTD=butes are some of his finest music -- the Hank is lean and cool, 
EXTD=the Wills as wide-open and swaggering as Texas (thanks in part to
EXTD=the inclusion of some prime instrumentals, too), the Jimmy Dicke
EXTD=ns side-stepping novelties to zero in on his hardest country. Eac
EXTD=h of these records was the kind of standard-issue classic country
EXTD=LP -- no more than ten or 12 tracks that in total clock in at a 
EXTD=half-hour -- that is easy to underrate as they're so tight and ea
EXTD=sy to enjoy (and in George's case, he made so many of them they'r
EXTD=e easy to take for granted), but when heard on this set, they for
EXTD=m a strong core for Jones' UA work, especially when they're taken
EXTD=together with his duets with Melba Montgomery. Many (including t
EXTD=he man himself) rank these as Jones' best duets ever, putting the
EXTD=m above his work with Tammy Wynette collaborations, when in truth
EXTD=they're kind of hard to compare -- not only are they different f
EXTD=rom the lush, dramatic work with Tammy, they're quite a bit diffe
EXTD=rent than any other country he ever did, occasionally veering int
EXTD=o the pile-driving intensity of bluegrass. \n\nThese hard country
EXTD=numbers form the heart of George's UA recordings, and their spir
EXTD=it bled into even some of his hit singles of the era, such as the
EXTD=desolate "Open Pit Mine," but most of his charting singles found
EXTD=Jones smoother, developing his ballad style, best represented by
EXTD=the stone classic "She Thinks I Still Care." This all can be hea
EXTD=rd on hits comps -- including Razor and Tie's fine double-disc UA o
EXTD=verview of the same name -- but what makes this Bear Family box v
EXTD=aluable is how it's not only these hard country, novelties, and b
EXTD=arroom ballads that surface - there's also Western swing, bluegras
EXTD=s, gospel, holiday tunes, even that twisting oddity. Not all of t
EXTD=his is good, but George's performances always are. It often seems
EXTD=that George would sing anything put in front of him and sing it 
EXTD=well -- in some ways, that's a detriment, as there's such a surpl
EXTD=us of material, but it also gives fanatics plenty of minor moment
EXTD=s to cherish, whether it's in neglected gems or mere turns of pha
EXTD=se. Even so, it's hard to deny that Pappy Daily and Art Talmadage
EXTD=- the head of UA who would later depart to form Musicor and, wh
EXTD=en he did, Daily and Jones followed right along -- treated George
EXTD=Jones as a mere commodity. While that resulted in too much music
EXTD=, much of it is saved by George's brilliant, intuitive performanc
EXTD=es, an almost accidental art that turns out to give even the fluf
EXTD=f some permanence.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Pr
EXTD=oduct Description\nGeorge Jones was coming off a successful Mercu
EXTD=ry Records contract when his producer Pappy Daily took him to Uni
EXTD=ted Artists Records in 1962. Instantly, he became UA's top countr
EXTD=y star and got off to a powerful start with Dickey Lee's ballad S
EXTD=he Thinks I Still Care, an award-winning performance at the time,
EXTD=a country music standard today. \n\nOver the next two and a half
EXTD=years, Jones recorded originals along with songs written by some
EXTD=of Nashville's greatest, among them Jack Clement (Not What I Had
EXTD=In Mind), Justin Tubb (Big Fool Of The Year), Hank Cochran and H
EXTD=arlan Howard (You Comb Her Hair) and Freddie Hart (My Tears Are O
EXTD=verdue). \n\nEven then, Jones's peers began embracing his still-e
EXTD=volving singing style, rooted in his admiration for both Roy Acuf
EXTD=f and Hank Williams, as a vocal Gold Standard. At UA, that style 
EXTD=continued developing while at the same time he expanded his scope
EXTD=by teaming with the truly great female duet partner: Melba Montg
EXTD=omery. Together, they created an amazing, even hypnotic tradition
EXTD=al vocal synergy on hits including We Must Have Been Out Of Our M
EXTD=inds and to this day, Jones considers his work with Melba his bes
EXTD=t work with a female singer. On tour, his antics still centered a
EXTD=round his legendary boozing and hell-raising yet Jones's studio o
EXTD=utput for UA was amazingly consistent, the accompaniment traditio
EXTD=nal though the Jordanaires frequently appeared on various UA sess
EXTD=ions. \n\nAlong with revealing the complete scope of Jones's two 
EXTD=and a half years, the collection also includes rare photos and ex
EXTD=tensive, detailed liner notes by Rich Kienzle including comments 
EXTD=from Jones, Montgomery and the late Buck Owens. \n\n\nHalf.com Al
EXTD=bum Notes\nCountry music doesn't get any more essential than this
EXTD=The five-disc box set SHE THINKS I STILL CARE is undoubtedly th
EXTD=e most awe-inspiring George Jones collection to date. Jones was a
EXTD=t his peak during his 1962-'64 stint on the UA label, and some of
EXTD=his most unforgettable recordings hail from this era. You get mu
EXTD=ch more on this set than mere timeless, undeniable gems such as "
EXTD=The Race is On," "She Thinks I Still Care," and "Let's Invite The
EXTD=m Over," though.\n\nFrom heartbroken Hank Williams tributes like 
EXTD="Take These Chains From My Heart" to the spiritual intensity of "
EXTD=Kneel at the Feet of Jesus" and a generous helping of Jones's leg
EXTD=endary duets with Melba Montgomery (easily on a par with his Tamm
EXTD=y Wynette collaborations), this set gives us a full picture of th
EXTD=e man's artistry. And with five discs worth of tracks, you couldn
EXTD='t ask for more comprehensive coverage of this era. You can get t
EXTD=he aforementioned hits on a million best-of packages, it's the re
EXTD=st of the story that makes SHE THINKS I STILL CARE such an outsta
EXTD=nding musical document.\n\nDirty Linen (p.86) - "Jones, who easil
EXTD=y made the transition from honky-tonk cowboy to sweet ballad croo
EXTD=ner over the years, ha s voice that can belt out a growl, then sl

EXTD=\nfrom Archives.NoDepression.com\n\nReissue Review from Issue #75
EXTD=May-June 2008\nBy David Cantwell \n\nGeorge Jones' brief stint a
EXTD=t United Artists is sometimes cited as a kind of personal golden 
EXTD=age for the singer, and it's easy to see why. He recorded some of
EXTD=his signature hits for the label -- "The Race Is On", "She Think
EXTD=s I Still Care" -- and it was at United Artists, too, that Jones 
EXTD=began to be mentioned as one of the genre's finest-ever balladeer
EXTD=s, a singer the equal of Marty Robbins, Lefty Frizzell and Hank W
EXTD=illiams.\n\nListen to "Just A Girl I Used To Know", a #3 hit for 
EXTD=Jones in late 1962. Written by Jack Clement, the song expresses a
EXTD=typical country irony and a Jones specialty: The girl he's singi
EXTD=ng about is not "just" an old acquaintance. She's his world -- th
EXTD=at's why her photo is in his wallet -- and she's gone. It's a swe
EXTD=ll conceit for a song, but Jones' choices as a singer pack Clemen
EXTD=ts' lyric with so much more than what was on the page: the way hi
EXTD=s intensity and volume build to the choruses where he almost lose
EXTD=s it, only to quiet down again as he gets it together for the nex
EXTD=t verse - the way he stretches out "just" so far that it's bound t
EXTD=o snap back in his face - the way his voice trembles with, of all 
EXTD=the crazy things, tenderness for this woman who's broken his hear
EXTD=t.\n\nShe Thinks I Still Care, a new five-disc set, includes the 
EXTD=151 sides Jones cut at U.A., and (hyperbole be damned!) all 151 o
EXTD=f them are in their different ways just as amazing. That means no
EXTD=t only classic hits such as Jones and Melba Montgomery's emotiona
EXTD=lly complex ode to second chances "We Must Have Been Out Of Our M
EXTD=inds", but also Jones' many tribute albums from these years (to B
EXTD=ob Wills, Hank Williams, and his friend Jimmy Dickens), as well a
EXTD=s more obscure but still essential sides such the exquisitely ten
EXTD=der ("tender" is the most unheralded element in the Jones catalog
EXTD=ue) "Book Of Memories" and the terrifying murder ballad "In The S
EXTD=hadow Of A Lie".\n\nThat's quite a range of emotion expressed in 
EXTD=those last two tracks, but it is country music's range. She Think
EXTD=s I Still Care argues, once again, that no one managed the many s
EXTD=pots on that divide better than George Jones.\n\n\n-- RELATED INF

EXTD=--------------------------------\nfrom http://www.rockabillyhall
EXTD=com/BearFamily.html\n\nAfter scoring hits on Starday and Mercury
EXTD=, George Jones moved to United Artists where he averaged a studio
EXTD=session every 3 - 4 months and produced 150 songs including 19 c
EXTD=hart hits. Supported by great material, performed with only the b
EXTD=est musicians and imbued with the unmistakable Jones touch, this 
EXTD=sizzling five-disc boxed set collects them all for the first time
EXTD=\n\nJones' first release on United Artists was the Dickey Lee c
EXTD=omposition "She Thinks I Still Care," a classic weeper, it was a 
EXTD=number 1 country hit for an astonishing for 23 weeks. Another cla
EXTD=ssic is the superb "The Race Is On," an up-tempo heartache ditty 
EXTD=that still defines his style for fans today. Jones other hits are
EXTD=here in all their digitally remastered glory, including "Your He
EXTD=art Turned Left (And I Was On The Right)," "Where Does A Little T
EXTD=ear Come From" "Not What I Had In Mind" "A Girl I Used To Know" a
EXTD=nd "You Comb Her Hair." \n\nBoxed sets give devoted listeners a c
EXTD=hance to hear material that has been unavailable for decades. In 
EXTD=this case, tracks that wound up on such albums as "Homecoming In 
EXTD=Heaven" from his tribute album to Little Jimmy Dickens's "George 
EXTD=Jones Sings Like The Dickens," "My Favorites Of Hank Williams," a
EXTD=nd "George Jones Sings Bob Wills" movingly showcase the Texas bor
EXTD=n singer-songwriter's peerless ability as a stylist. Further, the
EXTD=comprehensive collection puts a welcome spotlight on the singer'
EXTD=s penchant for seasonal novelties such as "My Mom and Santa Claus
EXTD=(Twistin' Santa Claus)." \n\nSix recordings make their debut her
EXTD=e: "Alabama," "Is This How A Broken Heart Dies," "Let's Go Home,"
EXTD="Wouldn't It Be Something," an earlier attempt of his #29 hit "I
EXTD=Saw Me" and "Will There Ever Be Another" with frequent singing p
EXTD=artner Melba Montgomery. Both singers blend well together, especi
EXTD=ally on their 1963 #3 smash "We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds."
EXTD=Rich Kienzle obtained interviews with George Jones, Melba Montgo
EXTD=mery and Buck Owens for his excellent booklet notes in this class
EXTD=y and informative package. The result is a milestone set essentia
