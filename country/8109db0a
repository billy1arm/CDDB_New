EXTD=ed a certain creative desperation on The Pretender, Jackson Brown
EXTD=e lowered his sights (and raised his commercial appeal) considera
EXTD=bly with Running on Empty, which was more a concept album about t
EXTD=he road than an actual live album, even though its songs were som
EXTD=etimes recorded on-stage (and sometimes on the bus or in the hote
EXTD=l). Unlike most live albums, though, it consisted of previously u
EXTD=nrecorded songs. Browne had less creative participation on this a
EXTD=lbum than on any he ever made, solely composing only two songs, c
EXTD=o-writing four others, and covering another four. And he had less
EXTD=to say - the title song and leadoff track neatly conjoined his a
EXTD=rtistic and escapist themes. Figuratively and creatively, he was 
EXTD=out of gas, but like "the pretender," he still had to make a livi
EXTD=ng. The songs covered all aspects of touring, from Danny O'Keefe'
EXTD=s "The Road," which detailed romantic encounters, and "Rosie" (co
EXTD=written by Browne and his manager Donald Miller), in which a sou
EXTD=ndman pays tribute to auto-eroticism, to, well, "Cocaine," to the
EXTD=travails of being a roadie ("The Load-Out"). Audience noises, hu
EXTD=morous asides, loose playing - they were all part of a rough-arou
EXTD=nd-the-edges musical evocation of the rock and roll touring life. I
EXTD=t was not what fans had come to expect from Browne, of course, bu
EXTD=t the disaffected were more than outnumbered by the newly convert
EXTD=ed. (It didn't hurt that "Running on Empty" and "The Load-Out"/"S
EXTD=tay" both became Top 40 hits.) As a result, Browne's least ambiti
EXTD=ous, but perhaps most accessible, album ironically became his big
EXTD=gest seller. But it is not characteristic of his other work: for 
EXTD=many, it will be the only Browne album they will want to own, jus
EXTD=t as others always will regard it disdainfully as "Jackson Browne
EXTD=lite." [The 2005 expanded reissue of Running on Empty is a doubl
EXTD=e-disc set, containing a remastered CD of the album on the first 
EXTD=disc and a DVD of the album on the second. The DVD contains a 5.1
EXTD=mix of the album plus two bonus tracks that only appear on the D
EXTD=VD - a second take on "Cocaine" called "Cocaine Again" and an ins
EXTD=trumental, "Edwardsville Room 124." There are also two video mont
EXTD=ages and an extensive photo gallery, along with lyrics.] -- Willi

EXTD=ender, Jackson Browne confessed to enough distractions from his c
EXTD=raft and disenchantment with the world around him to make a candi
EXTD=d and contemporary rock album that set an optimistic stage for wh
EXTD=at was lying on-deck. And though Running On Empty would become Br
EXTD=owne's quarter-century meal ticket, it was no favorite to the har
EXTD=d cores who found commercial contrivance in its "rock-star-on-the
EXTD=road" concept. Yet nearly three decades after its release, the r
EXTD=emastered and repackaged live album sounds as innovative and unsu
EXTD=llied as ever (complete with a DVD that includes audio of two pre
EXTD=viously unreleased songs from the era). Recorded on stage, on mot
EXTD=el room furniture, and aboard the tour bus, the songs served as B
EXTD=rowne's diary of a mad musician, including womanizing in Danny O'
EXTD=Keefe's "The Road," drugs in the Rev. Gary Davis' sermonette "Coc
EXTD=aine" and the enduring anthem of roadies and crowd adoration (and
EXTD=a Top 10 hit), "The Load-Out." Though Browne's commercial appeal
EXTD=would never again rise to this level, his legacy in his generati

EXTD=t Description\nQuintessential California singer-songwriter and 20
EXTD=04 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Jackson Browne has created
EXTD=some of the most literate and emotionally resonant compositions 
EXTD=in popular music. Rhino's new version of Running on Empty is an i

EXTD=corded onstage, backstage, in three different hotel rooms, and on
EXTD=a Continental Silver Eagle tour bus during a cross-country 1977 
EXTD=tour, Running on Empty is a paean to life on the road. Jackson Br
EXTD=owne's sense of camaraderie extended to the road crew, if "The Lo
EXTD=ad Out," a love song to his roadies, is to be believed. Browne is
EXTD=much more blithe here than in his earlier outings. But Empty als
EXTD=o represents a fleeting lighthearted moment for the singer-cum-po
EXTD=et whose concerns became more political than personal after its a
EXTD=ppearance. Beneath its flippant surface, this disc is a look at t
EXTD=he lengths Browne and his friends went to avoid facing the demand
EXTD=s of the touring life. What with the frequent drug references, mi
EXTD=sogynistic references to on-the-fly pairings with women, and the 
EXTD=sobering line in the title track--"I look around for the friends 
EXTD=I used to pull me through - Looking into their eyes, I see them r
EXTD=unning, too"--one realizes that Browne was much more comfortable 
EXTD=on the road than off. --Jaan Uhelszki \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REV
EXTD=IEW\nTimeless artistry that should not be missed, December 6, 200
EXTD=5\nReviewer: George Dionne (WWW.ROCK-IS-LIFE.COM]\nThe Good \n"Ru
EXTD=nning on Empty" is the most familiar song on the album, and it so
EXTD=unds so much better with its heightened clarity and 5.1 mix. Jack
EXTD=son expressed how his journeys are wearing down on him. "The Road
EXTD=" takes you deeper into depression and despair with acoustic guit
EXTD=ars and emotional lyrics. The piano heavy track "Rosie" delves in
EXTD=to the trials and tribulations of the `groupie' culture. It's no 
EXTD=surprise that drugs were a big part of the music industry at the 
EXTD=time (did I just say were?). Browne approaches the subject with a
EXTD=little bit of humor and a little bit of sadness on "Cocaine." \n
EXTD=\n"Love Needs a Heart" is a touching power ballad where Browne pu
EXTD=ts his heart out on his sleeve. "Nothing But Time" has a funky rh
EXTD=ythm and bluesy vocals that convey all that can happen when you h
EXTD=ave nothing to do until the next show. "Stay" wraps the whole sag
EXTD=a up with a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. Whereas most o
EXTD=f the album focused on the negative aspects of the road, this one
EXTD=focuses on the great things and people you deal with along the w
EXTD=ay. The bonus tracks are included only on the DVD mix of the albu
EXTD=m. "Cocaine Again" is okay, but not really interesting, and "Edwa
EXTD=rdsville Room 124" is a mellow instrumental. \n\nThe Bad \nThe re
EXTD=st of the DVD material (montages, photos, lyrics) are cool to hav
EXTD=e, but you'll probably only view them once. \n\nThe Verdict \nI n
EXTD=ever really listened to what Running On Empty was all about until
EXTD=now. Apparently I missed a lot just listening to it casually. Th
EXTD=e album is a well-written, informative, intelligent, and sometime
EXTD=s sad account of life on the road. It's an album that can hold it
EXTD='s own no matter what decade your talking about. I can honestly s
EXTD=ay that Running On Empty is a timeless piece of artistry that sho
EXTD=uld not be missed. The 5.1 mix is excellent.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOM

EXTD=Kuenning "Roadie For Life" (Stafford, TX United States) \nWhen th
EXTD=is album came out in 1977 I was a roadie on tour with another art
EXTD=ist. We heard this record when we came home on a short break a fe
EXTD=w weeks after it was released and I couldn't believe it...an albu
EXTD=m that commemorated life on the road. Although "Running on Empty"
EXTD=has been played to death it still holds up as a great rock anthe
EXTD=m. The best song on the CD is definitely "Rosie" which captures t
EXTD=he true essence of the roadie life (losing the girl to the drumme
EXTD=r). The sleeper track is "The Road" a melancholy reflection on th
EXTD=e horrible loneliness that is prevalent on the road. Finally the 
EXTD=song "Cocaine" hits WAY to close to home for those of us that wer
EXTD=e seduced by its charms back then. Running on Empty is a must hav
EXTD=e CD for anyone that experienced the concert scene in the 70's (o
EXTD=r wishes they could have). I give this CD 5 stars (attached with

EXTD=ment!, September 3, 2000\nReviewer: Gary Gardner "Your resident d
EXTD=illettante" (Ellsworth, ME United States) \nFor a recording artis
EXTD=t, there is probably no trial of fire like taking the new music o
EXTD=ut on the road, and hearing fans' reactions to it. As a litmus te
EXTD=st, a tour can make or break an artist, particularly one just sta
EXTD=rting out. Of course, when Browne released this album, he was alr
EXTD=eady a grizzled veteran of playing stadiums - still, he felt compe
EXTD=lled to lay down a permanent record of what road life was like. "
EXTD=Running on Empty" is a live recording, but unlike one ever made b
EXTD=efore. Some of the tracks were recorded backstage, away from the 
EXTD=glare of the audience, some on tour buses...some even in hotels. 
EXTD=It is as stark a view as one is able to get of the bumps in the r
EXTD=oad for a travelling band. The title track was a brand new song w
EXTD=hen it was played before an audience - it is still a radio classic
EXTD="The Road" is a song that specifically addresses the artist's c
EXTD=oncern about how his material will be treated by the fans, while 
EXTD=maintaining one's sanity amidst the grueling touring schedule. Th
EXTD=e album is peppered with references to other realities familiar t
EXTD=o the recording artist: groupies and drugs. "Cocaine" is an acous
EXTD=tic blues number featuring Glenn Frey of the Eagles. "Rosie" is a
EXTD=great double-entendre song about a groupie showing up backstage;
EXTD=Browne tries to pick her up, but the drummer sweeps "that girl a
EXTD=way", leaving Browne to, ahem, take matters into his own hands, s
EXTD=hall we say. "Love Needs a Heart" is a great ballad that demonstr
EXTD=ates the singer-songwriter's virtuosity. "Nothing But Time" was r
EXTD=ecorded by Browne and Company on their tour bus after leaving a s
EXTD=how in Portland, Maine, and shows Jackson in very lighthearted mo
EXTD=od. "You Love the Thunder" is the outstanding rocker on the album
EXTD=, but the mood is mainly subtle throughout. Browne's images are e
EXTD=xtremely evocative, and he is at the peak of his career here. The
EXTD=album ends with the excellent FM classic, "The Load-Out/Stay", w
EXTD=hich the author reveals to a live audience he is just performing 
EXTD=it for the first time. The live tracks played in front of crowds 
EXTD=feature very little of the crowd response, almost like studio mus
EXTD=ic accepted in first takes. "Load-Out" may be the only exception 
EXTD=to the rule. Browne incorporates the Zodiacs' '50's song "Stay", 
EXTD=featuring guitarist David Lindley's brilliant falsetto. This albu
EXTD=m is an essential for any rock enthuiast - each moment is thorough
EXTD=ly enjoyable. Do yourself a big favor, and definitely pick this o
EXTD=ne up.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA GREAT ALBUM FOR ANYONE BU
EXTD=T JACKSON, June 10, 1999\nReviewer: A music fan\nDon't get me wro
EXTD=ng, I love this record. It just isn't up to the standards of JACK
EXTD=SON BROWNE, FOR EVERYMAN, and the towering LATE FOR THE SKY. Like
EXTD=its' immediate predecessor THE PRETENDER, it contains some monum
EXTD=ental moments, but overall the feeling is slightly second-tier--b
EXTD=earing in mind that second-tier Jackson Browne is better than fir
EXTD=st-tier almost everybody else. . .\nThe title track stands toe-to
EXTD=toe with anything the man has ever done. Jackson's reading of Da
EXTD=nny O'Keefe's beautiful "The Road" is perfect in its' weary cynic
EXTD=ism. The celebrated "Rosie" is cute, but a throwaway. "You Love T
EXTD=he Thunder" is another brilliant moment, but there's something cr
EXTD=eepy about the hotel-room recording of "Cocaine", especially the 
EXTD=stoned-sounding Jackson wondering if he should do more or less co
EXTD=ke. "Shaky Town" is a nice country tune, but the trucker referenc
EXTD=es are dated, planting the song squarely in the 70's. "Love Needs
EXTD=a Heart" is another gorgeous moment, one of JB's most moving hea
EXTD=rtache songs. "Nothing But Time" is an okay ditty. "The Load Out"
EXTD=is perhaps the most heartfelt tribute to one's fans, roadies and
EXTD=bandmates ever recorded. \n\nI'm sorry to say that for me the al
EXTD=bum ends on a sour note. I've never liked "Stay" in any way, shap
EXTD=e or form, from Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs on down, and des
EXTD=pite Jackson's attempt to make this an extension of the "Load Out
EXTD=" tribute, I usually dump this track when I'm listening to the CD
EXTD=\n\nMy favorite live Jackson Browne is a bootleg LP of a benefit
EXTD=concert he did at the Main Point, a small club outside Philadelp
EXTD=hia, in 1975, with just Lindley backing him. I was at that show, 
EXTD=and it was one of the great moments of my concertgoing life. It l
EXTD=asted nearly three hours, and included several songs by the then-
EXTD=unknown Warren Zevon ("Remember the name", Jackson tells us, "Z-E
EXTD=V-O-N"), a brilliant opening medley of "Fair and Tender Ladies/T
EXTD=ake It Easy", and Doug Heywood's immortal "You A**hole You". If t
EXTD=here's ever a JB box set I hope whoever puts it together gives a
