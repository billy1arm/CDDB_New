EXTD=Released June 10, 1998\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Willie Nelson's '60
EXTD=s recordings for RCA have long been the subject of critical disda
EXTD=in due to the supposed ill fit between Nelson's idiosyncratic sty
EXTD=le and the conventions of the Nashville sound era. In fact, Nelso
EXTD=n's RCA material is largely of high quality, his modest hits from
EXTD=this period were often excellent, and his uniqueness comes throu
EXTD=gh no matter how syrupy the orchestration (which isn't always the
EXTD=case -- the production on many of these tracks is quite spare). 
EXTD=This deluxe eight-CD box set compiles everything Nelson recorded 
EXTD=during his eight years with RCA, including a complete live set, u
EXTD=nreleased recordings, rough takes of songs that would later surfa
EXTD=ce on his A&M albums, and his few early-'60s recordings for Monum
EXTD=ent. Nelson covers Western swing, pop-country, ballads, and versi
EXTD=ons of classic country songs in minimalist fashion with his jazzy
EXTD=phrasing fully developed. In fact, those who have been frightene
EXTD=d away from these recordings by critics may be surprised by how l
EXTD=ittle they differ from his '70s sound. Fans will delight over the
EXTD=LP-sized hardback book that accompanies this set and the opportu
EXTD=nity to review a neglected episode in the Willie saga.  -- Greg A

EXTD=EVIEW\nWILLIE IN HIS SONGWRITING PRIME, March 24, 2000\nBy A Cust
EXTD=omer\n\nMerle Haggard said in an interview that if he had to be j
EXTD=ealous of one person in country music, that person would be Willi
EXTD=e Nelson. Merle must have been thinking about some of the songs o
EXTD=n this box set when he made that remark.\nI have to agree with th
EXTD=e music fan from Philly that this box set is a major release even
EXTD=though reviews have been less than stellar. It's not great from 
EXTD=start to finish by any means but the critical reviews I've read h
EXTD=ave made too much of the lowlights and not enough of the highligh
EXTD=ts. The lowlights have mostly been attributed to "The Nashville S
EXTD=ound" which Chet Atkins, Willie's producer for some of this box s
EXTD=et material, has been credited with pioneering. Country purists u
EXTD=sually have a tough time with the Nashville Sound because it empl
EXTD=oys "violins" (not fiddles) and bland backup choirs. You will fin
EXTD=d that sort of thing on this set even though it wasn't the best s
EXTD=etting for Willie. Chet Atkins has admitted that he didn't produc
EXTD=e Willie properly but was forced to experiment because Willie jus
EXTD=t wasn't selling in this period. But the Nashville Sound is not t
EXTD=he whole story of this set by any means.\n\nFour songs into Disc 
EXTD=1 you have one of the greatest Willie songs of all time, "I Never
EXTD=Cared For You", and not a violin or choir in earshot. I first he
EXTD=ard this song on Willie's recent "Teatro" album but the box set v
EXTD=ersion is much better. This song is just the tip of the iceberg a
EXTD=s far as quality songs are concerned. However, you have to be pat
EXTD=ient and really listen to these discs to get to the gems. On Disc
EXTD=2, for instance, there is a great version of "San Antonio Rose" 
EXTD=and a not-so-good, poppier version only two songs apart. The mora
EXTD=l of the story is you don't know when or where you're going to fi
EXTD=nd great songs. Besides the highlights listed above, I'd list som
EXTD=e other standouts as "December Day", "Wild Memories",the Vietnam-
EXTD=themed "Jimmy's Road", a cover of Fred Neil's "Everbody's Talkin"
EXTD=(all Disc 4), "I Gotta Get Drunk", a cover of Joni Mitchell's "B
EXTD=oth Sides Now" (both Disc 5), and "Rainy Day Blues" [CD6]. You
EXTD='ll find many more.\n\nThe bonus to this box set is the vintage m
EXTD=id-60s live Willie concert recording on Disc 8. If you're a Willi
EXTD=e fan, you know Willie was never a musical snob or purist with tu
EXTD=nnel vision when it came to doing material. The cover versions of
EXTD=the Joni Mitchell and Fred Neil tracks listed above as well as a
EXTD=ll the material on the classic "Stardust" album from the late 70s
EXTD=attest to Willie's eclectic tastes. On this live disc, Willie is
EXTD=already covering the recent (at that time) "Yesterday" by the Be
EXTD=atles. Again, the live recording is a real bonus.\n\nIf you're a 
EXTD=big Willie fan and have the dough to plunk down for this box set,
EXTD=it is well worth your investment. It's not a greatest hits in th
EXTD=at everything in terms of artistic quality or even sales is progr
EXTD=ammed back-to-back. But some of Willie's greatest songs, artistic
EXTD=ally speaking, are definitely found throughout these discs.\n\n\n
EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nToo Much Bad Stuff Weighs This Boxset
EXTD=Down, August 7, 2006\nBy allismile0 "allismile0" (Washington, DC
EXTD=]\n\nThere is no doubt that there are some real gems on Nashville
EXTD=Was The Roughest that would be hard to find anywhere else. But o
EXTD=f 8 Cd's, most of the good stuff could be filed down to one, perh
EXTD=aps two Cd's.\n\nThe only albums of Willie Nelson's early career 
EXTD=(before he shifted to Atlantic Records) that are really solid are
EXTD=Country Willie and Yesterday's Wine. All the other albums have a
EXTD=couple of good songs here or there, but mostly just fall flat- w
EXTD=ith boring tunes and very typical production of that time in Nash
EXTD=ville.\n\nThis box set is definitely a testament of a great artis
EXTD=t who started with a plenty of talent but with very little self s
EXTD=tyle. On different records you can hear him imitating anything fr
EXTD=om Roy Orbison, Ray Price, Bob Willis, and even LA's 1960's psych
EXTD=edelic rock. He finally started coming into his own on Yesterday'
EXTD=s Wine, which oddly enough doesn't sound too far removed from the
EXTD=sound of Country Willie, but with a more soulful earthiness.\n\n
EXTD=There's no question that he really came into his own when he went
EXTD=to Atlantic and recorded Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages back
EXTD=to back.\n\nNashville Was The Roughest is most certainly for com
EXTD=pletest, if you are interested in his early recording career ther
EXTD=e are plenty of "best of" compilations from during his RCA period
EXTD=\n\nAlso of note are the recordings he did for Liberty records i
EXTD=n the early 60's before he signed with RCA.
