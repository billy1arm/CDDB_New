EXTD=classic live set is one of the best ways to hear Owens and his B

EXTD='s onstage antics (jokey asides, patter and parodies abound) are 
EXTD=indicative of the Buckaroos' ease with each other onstage. Musica

EXTD='s tasty steel licks and the rock-solid rhythm section. Unlike mo

EXTD=mple recitation of their hit song catalog.\n\nBy this 1966 date, 
EXTD=their catalog was too extensive to be played through in a single 
EXTD=show, hence three medleys are used to cover a lot of ground. Even
EXTD=with those thirteen abbreviated titles, they had plenty of mater

EXTD=e even more powerfully than it does in the studio, and the tightn
EXTD=ess of his harmonies with Don Rich are mesmerizing. The telepathy
EXTD=between Owens and Rich goes a long way to explaining the former'

EXTD=with which the band kicks into every number is simply astonishin
