EXTD=may prefer that to this relatively shorter collection, simply be
EXTD=cause it digs deeper into one of the richest catalogs in country

EXTD=duction for neophytes, since it boils down his catalog to the 18

EXTD=iter and singer, including such classics as "If You've Got the Mo

EXTD=Best Voices, August 1, 2000 \nBy  Daniel Q. Kelly (Chicago, IL]\n
EXTD=\nLefty Frizzell wasn't a giant of country music like, say, Hank 
EXTD=Williams or Jimmie Rodgers, but he WAS one of the all-time great 
EXTD=voices. Lefty swooped from the highs to the lows with breathless 
EXTD=ease. Whether singing about good times or a broken heart, there w
EXTD=as always a undeniable genuineness to his voice. "Forever (and Al
EXTD=ways)" and "Mom and Dad's Waltz" will just wring the hell out of 
EXTD=your heart, while barnburners such as "If You've Got the Money, I
EXTD='ve Got the Time" will have you up and stompin' the floor to spli
