EXTD=If the final installment of ABKCO's series of box sets containin
EXTD=g CD replicas of the Rolling Stones' original singles for Decca a
EXTD=nd London during the '60s seems not quite as impressive as the fi
EXTD=rst two, there's a reason for it: it's not. But that has little t
EXTD=o do with either the music -- some of the Stones' very best is he
EXTD=re, including "Street Fighting Man," "Honky Tonk Women," and "Jum
EXTD=pin' Jack Flash," all viable contenders for the greatest rock and r
EXTD=oll single ever -- or the packaging, which is every bit as lavish
EXTD=and loving as the first two installments. Instead, the problem i
EXTD=s that the nine singles collected here are a bit of a hodgepodge.
EXTD=The aforementioned trio are the group's last singles of the '60s
EXTD=, with the latter two being the last two singles the band conceiv
EXTD=ed as stand-alone 45s. After that, there were two singles pulled 
EXTD=from the 1971 album Sticky Fingers -- "Brown Sugar" and "Wild Hor
EXTD=ses," both backed by album tracks (the former had a live version 
EXTD=of Chuck Berry's "Let It Rock" on a U.K. pressing, but that's not
EXTD=available here) -- and that LP is more commonly associated with 
EXTD=the Stones' '70s albums for their own label, not their '60s work,
EXTD=so even if historically they were part of the London years, they
EXTD=don't quite feel like the end of this chapter - rather, they feel
EXTD=like the beginning of the next. That accounts for half of Single
EXTD=s 1968-1971. The remaining five discs contain Mick Jagger's excel
EXTD=lent solo single of "Memo from Turner" from the film Performance,
EXTD=two singles from the 1975 '60s rarities compilation Metamorphosi
EXTD=s ("I Don't Know Why"/"Jiving Sister Fanny" and "I Don't Know Why
EXTD="/"Try a Little Harder"), the "Sympathy for the Devil" single -- 
EXTD=which was released in the U.K. in 1976, but is presented in its 2
EXTD=003 form containing contemporary dance remixes by the Neptunes an
EXTD=d Fatboy Slim, variations that are, needless to say, rather incon
EXTD=gruous in this setting -- and, finally, a welcome bonus DVD conta
EXTD=ining the Stones playing "Time Is On My Side" on The Ed Sullivan 
EXTD=Show in 1964, a live version of "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby,
EXTD=Standing in the Shadow?" from 1967, and the classic promo video 
EXTD=for "Jumpin' Jack Flash" from 1968, as well as an out-of-place 20
EXTD=03 video for the Neptunes' remix of "Sympathy for the Devil." Whi
EXTD=le all these odds and ends are nice to have, since they tie up an
EXTD=y loose ends from this era, the end result doesn't have the narra
EXTD=tive flow or the rarities of the previous installments. That said
EXTD=, Singles 1968-1971 is a wonderful set for collectors, and it ret
EXTD=ains the high standard of the rest of the series.   -- Stephen Th

EXTD=The third in a series of handsome box sets, SINGLES 1968-1971 is 
EXTD=yet another must-have for hardcore Rolling Stones fans. As with t
EXTD=he earlier installments, the collection presents the original 45'
EXTD=s in CD format, along with a booklet of informative liner notes, 
EXTD=vintage photos, and promotional artwork.\n\nAlthough the "Jumpin'
EXTD=Jack Flash" B-side, "Child of the Moon," finds the Stones still 
EXTD=attempting to keep pace with the Beatles (the song clearly echoes
EXTD=Lennon/McCartney's "Rain"), the aforementioned A-side presents t
EXTD=he group living up to their reputation as the World's Greatest Ro
EXTD=ck and Roll Band with blazing abandon. Given Brian Jones's 1969 dea
EXTD=th and his subsequent replacement by a young Mick Taylor, the era
EXTD=was clearly a transitional period for the Stones, and the music 
EXTD=reflects this, most notably in the country twang of "Honky Tonk W
EXTD=omen" and the wistful "Wild Horses." A particular treat for Jagge
EXTD=r fans is the inclusion of his strutting "Memo from Turner" singl
EXTD=e, taken from the film PERFORMANCE, along with the Ry Cooder inst
EXTD=rumental "Natural Magic." The set also includes a "Sympathy for t
EXTD=he Devil" single updated with 2003 remixes and a DVD featuring fo
EXTD=ur videos.\n\nIndustry Reviews\n4 stars out of 5 - What's not in

EXTD=AMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n"The London Years" Compared To The 3 
EXTD="Singles" Box Sets, June 12, 2006 \nBy  Mark Wilson (Huntington, 
EXTD=WV USA]\n\nThe purpose of this review is to completely compare th
EXTD=e contents of "Singles Collection: The London Years" to the 3 "Si
EXTD=ngles" box sets which as a group contain the same songs plus more
EXTD=There are some good comparisons in the other reviews, but also 
EXTD=several omissions and inaccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comp
EXTD=arison will clear things up a bit as to what songs are included o
EXTD=n each, and which "missing" songs can also be found on the other 
EXTD=ABKCO CD's, particularly "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookie
EXTD=s". Each of these collections is rather expensive, so hopefully t
EXTD=his may help you decide which sets you really need or want. \n\nT
EXTD=o settle one thing first though, the songs on the "Got Live If Yo
EXTD=u Want It" EP contained in the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NO
EXTD=T included on the full length CD "Got Live If You Want It". They 
EXTD=share the same title but that's all, and were actually two differ
EXTD=ent releases. Buying the full length CD will NOT get you all the 
EXTD=same songs on the EP as indicated in another review. With that ou
EXTD=t of the way..... \n\n"Singles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: T
EXTD=he London Years" contains all of the songs included in this box s
EXTD=et, with the exception of 3 original British EP's exclusive to th
EXTD=e box set. The first EP contains You Better Move On (also availab
EXTD=le on "December's Children") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Mon
EXTD=ey (all 3 also available on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Coo
EXTD=kies"). The second EP (originally titled "5 X 5") contains If You
EXTD=Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The
EXTD=Blues and Around and Around, all of which are also available on th
EXTD=e "12 X 5" CD. The third EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You
EXTD=Want It") contains early live versions of We Want The Stones, Ev
EXTD=erybody Needs Somebody To Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm M
EXTD=ovin On and I'm Alright, none of which are available on any other C
EXTD=D (with the possible exception of I'm Alright which may or may no
EXTD=t be the same version included on the full-length "Got Live..." C
EXTD=D). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" c
EXTD=ontain the early single/B-sides Come On (also available on "More 
EXTD=Hot Rocks") as well as I Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and 
EXTD=Stoned which aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets
EXTD=contain 3 songs not included elsewhere, plus the box set include
EXTD=s the live EP. So the deciding factor between "The London Years" 
EXTD=and "Singles 63-65" would appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 
EXTD=1965-1967": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all o
EXTD=f the songs included in this 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Bot
EXTD=h contain the single/B-sides Long Long While and We Love You (also 
EXTD=available on "More Hot Rocks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your P
EXTD=lane? which aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets 
EXTD=contain 2 songs not included elsewhere. No further conclusions. \n
EXTD=\n"Singles 1968-1971": "Singles Collection: The London Years" con
EXTD=tains all of the songs included in this 3rd box set, with a few u
EXTD=nique exceptions. The third box set additionally contains Everybo
EXTD=dy Needs Somebody to Love (also available on "The Rolling Stones 
EXTD=Now!") and three non-ABKCO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the b
EXTD=ox set. The B-sides are the Ry Cooder instrumental Natural Magic 
EXTD=(from the film "Performance" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was th
EXTD=e A-side) and Bitch and Sway which were the B-sides to Brown Sugar 
EXTD=& Wild Horses. My guess is the licensing rights to these B-sides 
EXTD=belong to Virgin Records, etc. and hadn't yet been negotiated whe
EXTD=n "The London Years" was originally released back in 1989. The re
EXTD=mixes appear to be 3 different "rap" style remixes of Sympathy Fo
EXTD=r The Devil. The box set also contains a bonus DVD (see the item 
EXTD=description for more on that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Y
EXTD=ears" and "Singles 68-71" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (a
EXTD=lso available on "More Hot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses 
EXTD=(also available on "Hot Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between
EXTD="The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" would appear to be the th
EXTD=ree non-ABKCO B-sides, the three remixes and the DVD contained in
EXTD=the box set. \n\nFinal Conclusion: For the completest collector 
EXTD=who has to have absolutely everything on CD, you basically have 2
EXTD=choices. Buy all 3 box sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The Lon
EXTD=don Years" and the two box sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71"
EXTD=(a lot of duplication, though "The London Years" runs a little c
EXTD=heaper than the box sets and you don't have to change CD's as often
EXTD=). \n\nA slightly cheaper option if you're mainly interested in c
EXTD=ompleting the ABKCO Rolling Stones "canon" not released on the re
EXTD=gular studio full-length CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The 
EXTD=London Years" and "Singles 1963-1965". You'd only be missing the 
EXTD=three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes.
EXTD=\n\nA cheaper option still, if you're only interested in the ver
EXTD=y early singles and live EP and can live without a few later ABKCO 
EXTD=B-Sides, is to buy "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and
EXTD="Singles 1963-1965". With those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day,
EXTD=Who's Driving Your Plane? and the three non-ABKCO B-sides and th
EXTD=e 3 remixes. \n\nIn truth, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collec
EXTD=tion: The London Years" make an interesting listen because each i
EXTD=s primarily made up of A and B sides not included on the regular st
EXTD=udio CD's. So they're almost like listening to independent CD's w
EXTD=ithout repeating too many songs you'll hear when listening to the
EXTD=other albums. The 2nd disc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Throu
EXTD=gh The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with diff
EXTD=erent selections of songs, so comparing these two further is high
EXTD=ly recommended as well. \n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps

EXTD=rch 3, 2005 \nBy  Greg Pearce\n\nThis is the third and final inst
EXTD=allment of box sets covering the Stones singles released between 
EXTD=1963 - 1971. All three box sets are a treasure for stones collect
EXTD=ors because we get the original artwork for all the singles (and 
EXTD=early EP's) that the Stones released in the sixties. The cd's act
EXTD=ually look like old 45's. This box set covering the years 1968 - 
EXTD=1971 has a cool bonus dvd with several live performances and the 
EXTD=classic old Jumpin' Jack Flash video. However, this series of box
EXTD=sets is not for casual fans. The vast majority of songs can be f
EXTD=ound on the old London Years box set which Abkco remastered in th
EXTD=eir 2002 Rolling Stones remastered series. One omission on the si
EXTD=ngles 1968 - 1971 box set is the live version of Let It Rock reco
EXTD=rded at Leeds University in 1971 and originally released in the U
EXTD=K as the B side to Brown Sugar is not included. Apparently this i
EXTD=s because Virgin owns the rights to that song. Bottom line is tha
EXTD=t all three singles box sets are awesome if you want to have cd r
EXTD=eplicants of all the original 45's and the early EP's with their

EXTD=ng the *Jumpin' Jack Flash* video (with alternate audio take), an
EXTD=*Ed Sullivan Show* appearance, and the *Have You Seen Your Mothe

EXTD=ercharged for this extravagance, this time to a tune of $55-60. A
EXTD=ll of these images and songs could have been put together in a ni
EXTD=ce book and CD set for under $40 that could have avoided this cumbe
EXTD=rsome collection of pieces. The spectacular detail and craftsmans
EXTD=hip however, make this -- as with the other sets -- a worthy coll
EXTD=ector's item - down to the 'grooves' on the the top-side of the CD
EXTD=singles. The only disc on which the grooves do not belong is the
EXTD=2003 SFTD CD single. Without a doubt, the inclusion of the rare 
EXTD=*Street Fighting Man* PS is a joy to own for most whom could not 
EXTD=afford over $10,000 for the real thing. \n\nAn even more exciting
EXTD=aspect of this edition's *Street Fighting Man* is that it is the
EXTD=original (and alternate) single version which is otherwise unava
EXTD=ilable by any other legal means on CD. \n\nDespite the detail, th
EXTD=ere are glaring omissions. Abkco did not include the alternate 's
EXTD=ingle' version of *Sway*, and one track was missed entirely: *Let

EXTD=5-star collectible that could have been improved upon. Stones fan
