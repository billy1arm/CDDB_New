EXTD=G EXPERT REVIEW: In 1962, a few months after the release of Ray C
EXTD=harles' Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Nat King Cole
EXTD=released his "country" album, Ramblin' Rose. The string-drenched
EXTD=, pop-country approach was not too far removed from many of the N
EXTD=ashville Sound recordings of the era, but nonetheless much of thi
EXTD=s music bears little similarity to what is generally regarded as 
EXTD=country, and most of the material is foreign to country repertory
EXTD=Cole's version of the Claude King hit "Wolverton Mountain" is t
EXTD=he most country-sounding cut, while "Your Cheatin' Heart" is so f
EXTD=ar removed from Hank Williams that it's unintentionally funny. "R
EXTD=amblin' Rose" became a popular song to cover for a while, and man
EXTD=y of the other tracks, such as "Sing Another Song (And We'll Go H
EXTD=ome)" and a surprisingly successful version of "Skip to My Lou," 
EXTD=will please fans of Cole's 1960s pop-crooner phase. Focusing on c
EXTD=ountry songs reinterpreted for the pop market, Ramblin' Rose is a
EXTD=pleasant but not earth-shaking genre experiment, although it's c
EXTD=lear that the idea of producing a Nat King Cole country album was
EXTD=not the overriding artistic aim of the project. The 1987 CD incl
EXTD=udes a few tracks from a similar album Cole recorded the same yea
EXTD=r, and it's unfortunate that Capitol did not choose to release th
EXTD=e complete albums as a two-fer instead. -- Greg Adams\n\nAMAZON.C
EXTD=OM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNat does country...and quite well, July 25, 2
EXTD=001\nReviewer: The Fancy One "blackprincess" (New York, NY]\nI've
EXTD=had the RAMBLIN' ROSE (AND MORE) cd for well over a year, and to
EXTD=be honest, I was not too crazy about it when I first played it. 
EXTD=I'm not a country music fan so I REALLY wasn't feeling a lot of t
EXTD=he songs on it, and it spent more time on my shelf than in my CD 
EXTD=player. But as time went on, I've developed a love for this like 
EXTD=I didn't think I would. Of course I loved "Ramblin' Rose", but al
EXTD=ong with a couple other songs on the CD, they were the only ones 
EXTD=getting the time of day in my home...but playing it in its entire
EXTD=ty recently made me really appreciate even more what a diverse ta
EXTD=lent that Nat was. I figured he may have been following Ray Charl
EXTD=es' lead on doing an LP with a country/western theme, since Ray h
EXTD=ad done something similar earlier the same year (1962) and broke 
EXTD=all kinds of records when he did it, sort of creating a new genre
EXTD=of music: country soul. Nat did equally as well. \nThere are a f
EXTD=ew songs on RAMBLIN' ROSE (AND MORE) that tend to be a little on 
EXTD=the corny side (example: "Skip To My Lou", "Sing Another Song", "
EXTD=Twilight On The Trail"), but overall this CD is very good. Nat br
EXTD=ings his warm and seductive charm to these tunes, and like I said
EXTD=in a review of another Nat CD, Nat could sing anything and make 
EXTD=you love it...which is just what happened to me. It has that "eve
EXTD=rybody, sing-it-with-me" quality. Even though I'm not thrilled ab
EXTD=out "Wolverton Mountain", Nat handles it with a lot of spirit, an
EXTD=d I can't knock him for that. This is the way he approached every
EXTD=thing he sang, regardless of the genre. But enough about what I d
EXTD=on't like....The best cuts on this CD are of course, "Ramblin' Ro
EXTD=se", "I Don't Want It That Way", "Your Cheating Heart" and "Goodn
EXTD=ight Irene". Also outstanding is the wistfulness of "He'll Have T
EXTD=o Go" and "One Has My Name, The Other Has My Heart". "He'll Have 
EXTD=To Go" is especially tender and romantic, with the gentle oohs an
EXTD=d ahhs being sung in the background...no doubt, one of my favorit
EXTD=e songs on the CD. "The Good Times", which was originally the B-s
EXTD=ide of the "Ramblin' Rose" single, seems like it was a fluke that
EXTD=it ended up on this album because it's the only song on it that 
EXTD=is not arranged in the country/pop style...it's an upbeat pop/R&B
EXTD=joint that is reminiscent of the Ben E. King '60s hit "Stand By 
EXTD=Me". I liked the call-and-response arrangement that Nat and his b
EXTD=ackground chorus used in it - in fact the call-and-response techni
EXTD=que is used on several songs here. The AND MORE part of the CD fe
EXTD=atures three tracks from the follow up to the RAMBLIN' ROSE LP, D
EXTD=EAR LONELY HEARTS, another country/pop-themed album: "All By Myse
EXTD=lf", "All Over the World" and the title song, "Dear Lonely Hearts
EXTD=". The latter two songs were minor hits for Nat in late 1962. \n\n
EXTD=For a non-country fan like me, RAMBLIN' ROSE (AND MORE) turned ou
EXTD=t to be a pleasant surprize. Only Nat King Cole's magnificent voi
EXTD=ce could make me have more respect for that genre of music, where
EXTD=as before I thought most country songs were about drinking beer a
EXTD=nd cheating! LOL. This is an enjoyable CD. Add it to your collect
EXTD=ion!\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA real blast from my past !
EXTD=, November 28, 2003\nReviewer: James Dunn (Big Moose, NY USA]\nTh
EXTD=is album brings back warm fuzzy memories for me. In 1969 my Fathe
EXTD=r bought a brand new Ford station wagon and equipped it with a "s
EXTD=tate of the art" 8-track tape player with (wow) 4 speakers! The f
EXTD=amily, five kids and our parents took a 4000 mile round trip from
EXTD=the Adirondack mountains of New York State to Florida and back. 
EXTD=This recording in all of its 8-track glory was one of five tapes 
EXTD=that ran for most of the 200 hours we spent in the car. With ever
EXTD=yone asleep in the middle of the night and my Father driving alon
EXTD=g the interstate, a six year old Me came crawling into the front 
EXTD=seat. With NKC's velvet voice gently flowing from the speakers an
EXTD=d Dad's arm around me, I watched the world going safely by. To th
EXTD=is day when I play this music I can still smell that new car and 
EXTD=feel that long since gone arm on my shoulder. Nat "King" Cole had
EXTD=the kind of voice and talent which stands alone regardless of th
EXTD=e style of music he performed. If I had to live out my days with 
EXTD=only a limited selection of music, this album would be on the sho
