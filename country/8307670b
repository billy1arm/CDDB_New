EXTD=Dreams was Waylon Jennings' first number one record, and deserve
EXTD=dly so. He had created outlaw country with Honky Tonk Heroes, and
EXTD=then delivered two further albums that subtly developed its them
EXTD=es, even if they weren't quite as consistent. Dreaming My Dreams 
EXTD=maintains the consistency, increasing the country quotient while 
EXTD=subtly making it more sentimental than before. This is an unabash
EXTD=edly romantic album, not just in its love songs, but in its tribu
EXTD=tes to Waylon's heroes. "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" open
EXTD=s and "Bob Wills Is Still the King" closes the album -- making Je
EXTD=nnings an heir apparent to their legacies. Between those two extr
EXTD=emes, Waylon appropriates Jimmie Rodgers ("Waymore's Blues"), cov
EXTD=ers Roger Miller ("I've Been a Long Time Leaving [But I'll Be a L
EXTD=ong Time Gone]"), ups the outlaw ante ("Let's All Help the Cowboy
EXTD=s [Sing the Blues]"), and writes and records as many sentimental 
EXTD=tunes as possible without seeming like a sissy. At times, the emo
EXTD=tional undertow may seem a bit much, yet the whole thing adds up 
EXTD=as Waylon's best album since Honky Tonk Heroes, and one of the fe
EXTD=w of his prime outlaw period to deliver from beginning to end.  -

EXTD=truggle to wrest control in the studio has oft been told. Certain
EXTD=ly control was no guarantee of quality, but in the mid-'70s when 
EXTD=Waylon Jennings knew exactly what he wanted to do, it didn't hurt
EXTD=Dreaming My Dreams stands with Honky Tonk Heroes as one of Jenn
EXTD=ings' absolute best albums. "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" 
EXTD=and "Waymore's Blues" must have seemed like a rousing kick in the
EXTD=pants to Nashville in 1975. The steady thump of the bass and Jen
EXTD=nings' resonating vocals freshen up the tired country sounds by a
EXTD=dding a bit of rock and roll passion. Indeed, the staid country eli
EXTD=te must have feared that Lynyrd Skynyrd had just come to town. Bu
EXTD=t even with the passion and the electric guitars, no one should'v
EXTD=e mistaken Jennings for a Southern rocker. Steel guitar is featur
EXTD=ed prominently, and songs from "I Recall a Gypsy Woman" to "Bob W
EXTD=ills Is Still the King" reminisce about cowboys, cheatin' women, 
EXTD=and life on the road. Of course the sexism of songs like "The Doo
EXTD=r Is Always Open" seems a bit dated, but women's equality was nev
EXTD=er high on the country music priority list. The raw production by
EXTD=Jennings and Jack Clement still sounds fresh. Studio control als
EXTD=o meant no filler, meaning that Dreaming My Dreams' 11 songs, inc
EXTD=luding a live cut from 1974, are over in 31 minutes. Short, perha
EXTD=ps, but unforgettable.   -- Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr.\n\n\nAmazon.c

EXTD=Dreams is the best Waylon Jennings ever got. After that, while t
EXTD=here were other good songs and records, superstardom and the abus
EXTD=e of substances took their toll, and many of the songs -- especia
EXTD=lly the hits -- got ever more cartoonish and self-referential in 
EXTD=the Hank Williams, Jr., vein. But before Jennings lost his artist
EXTD='s grip, there was this, as well as the earlier Honky Tonk Heroes
EXTD=, his enduring tribute to Billy Joe Shaver's songwriting genius. 
EXTD=Dreaming My Dreams, which manages to fuse honkytonk grit, rock'n'
EXTD=roll rhythm, and folk melodicism, sounds like no other country al
EXTD=bum ever made.\n\nOnly Jack Clement's dopey "Let's All Help the C
EXTD=owboys (Sing the Blues)" anticipates the inferior material to com
EXTD=e. The rest is all stunning stuff, brought to life and breath via
EXTD=affectingly spare arrangements, with little to get in the way of
EXTD=the tightly wound vocals. The listener seems to be hearing the m
EXTD=iddle-of-the-night reflections of a man drifting in and out of co
EXTD=nsciousness, memories and dreams interwoven so that one can no lo
EXTD=nger be torn from the other, the effect enhanced by the somnambul
EXTD=ant fade-out that concludes each song.\n\nThough nearly all of th
EXTD=e songs are as good as songs get, the high point is Waylon and Cu
EXTD=rtis Buck's "Waymore's Blues." Here Jennings goes back to the roo
EXTD=ts of country music and beyond, to rewrite a 19th-Century America
EXTD=n folk song known in its different but related versions as "Milwa
EXTD=ukee Blues," "Jay Gould's Daughter," and even, in some variants, 
EXTD="Casey Jones." He even tosses in a couple of traditional verses a
EXTD=nd adds one so disingenuously sexually explicit that it may as we
EXTD=ll have been borrowed from an old-time downhome blues. "Waymore's
EXTD=Blues" is the masterpiece within the masterpiece. \n\n\nAMAZON.C
EXTD=OM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nWAYLON'S BEST ! (according to the man himself
EXTD=), April 14, 2007 \nBy  ol' nuff n' den sum (the Virginia coast, 
EXTD=USA]\n\nDreaming My Dreams was released in 1975, a couple of year
EXTD=s after Waylon Jennings had wrestled away artistic control of his
EXTD=music from the Nashville establishment. It was recorded in Tompa
EXTD=ll Glaser's "very cozy" upstairs recording studio. The first song
EXTD=is the electric guitar rocking, autobiographical Are You Sure Ha
EXTD=nk Done It This Way. \n\nSomebody told me when I came to Nashvill
EXTD=e \n"Son, you've finally got it made \nOl' Hank made it here and 
EXTD=we're all sure that you will" \nBut I don't think Hank done it th
EXTD=is way \n\nWaylon then gets reflective with Don Williams' Gypsy W
EXTD=oman. This is one of Waylon's best songs. Waylon's raspy baritone
EXTD=gives the impression of a big man who has lived life the hard wa
EXTD=y, but still stands tall and is ready for more (all were true). H
EXTD=is voice also had a persuasive vulnerability that has won listene
EXTD=rs over for decades. It's easy to identify with his struggles, an
EXTD=d easy to want to stand in his corner. There's a excellant versio
EXTD=n of Roger Miller's I've Been A Long Time Leaving (But I'll Be A 
EXTD=Long Time Gone) included here, too. The Door Is Always Open was a
EXTD=hit for the two girl, one guy trio, Dave and Sugar, but the song
EXTD=seems like it was written for Waylon. \n\nWhen night falls on th
EXTD=at mansion and you're lying in his bed \nWhen he begs you for att
EXTD=ention, will you think of me instead \nWhen he reaches out to tou
EXTD=ch you, is your face turned to the wall \nWell the door is always
EXTD=open and the lights on in the hall \n\nThe title track is Waylon
EXTD=at his most tender, but this guy never gets mushy. Not Waylon, n
EXTD=ot ever. He gets back into rowdy form, with a live version of Bob
EXTD=Wills Is Still The King. Waylon's dominating vocal performance s
EXTD=ounds great, and even though it's the only live song on the album
EXTD=, it fits right in. He had said Dreaming My Dreams was his favori
EXTD=te of all his albums, and it's easy to see why. This was Waylon J
EXTD=ennings at the top of his game.
