EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW (This Compilation) In early 2006, roughly in ti
EXTD=me for the 40th anniversary of Merle Haggard's debut album, Capit
EXTD=ol Nashville launched an ambitious Haggard catalog project, reiss
EXTD=uing ten albums as a series of five two-fers, each adorned with b
EXTD=onus tracks. All these albums had been reissued before, either st
EXTD=ateside by Capitol or Koch or in the U.K. by EMI or BGO, but they
EXTD='ve never have been given such an excellent treatment as they are
EXTD=here. The albums are paired together in logical, chronological o
EXTD=rder, the 24-bit digital remastering gives these recordings the b
EXTD=est sound they've ever had, the front cover artwork is reproduced
EXTD=for each album on a two-fer, and the liner notes are candid and 
EXTD=detailed. Dedicated Hag fans certainly have nearly all this mater
EXTD=ial in their collection -- not only have the albums been on CD, b
EXTD=ut the bonus tracks have by and large appeared on Bear Family's b
EXTD=ox Untamed Hawk, which chronicled his early work for Capitol, or 
EXTD=showed up on Capitol's own box, Down Every Road -- but they still
EXTD=may be tempted by this series, since these discs not only sound 
EXTD=and look terrific, but they're also more listenable than any prev
EXTD=ious CD incarnation of these classic albums.\n\nAnd make no mista
EXTD=ke, all ten albums featured in Capitol Nashville's first wave of 
EXTD=Haggard reissues in February 2006 are classic albums - some may be
EXTD=a little stronger than others, but there's not a weak one in the
EXTD=bunch, and they all stand as some of the finest music of their t
EXTD=ime. The fourth of these two-fers pairs his last album of 1968, M
EXTD=ama Tried, plus his first from 1969, Pride in What I Am. Mama Tri
EXTD=ed has a loose prison theme, with about a third of the album sung
EXTD=from the perspective of a prisoner. Chief among these is Haggard
EXTD='s masterpiece "Mama Tried," a semi-autobiographical tribute to a
EXTD=mother who couldn't steer her son right no matter how hard she t
EXTD=ried, but covers of Porter Wagoner's "Green Green Grass of Home" 
EXTD=and Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues," plus Mel Tillis' "I Coul
EXTD=d Have Gone Right," also give the album a loose theme, but this i
EXTD=s hardly a concept album. The rest of the album contains lean, to
EXTD=ugh Bakersfield honky tonk like "Little Ole Wine Drinker Me" and 
EXTD=an excellent cover of Lefty Frizzell's "Run 'Em Off," plus such b
EXTD=ittersweet, folky tunes as a cover of Dolly Parton's "In the Good
EXTD=Old Days (When Times Were Bad)." There are also a number of exce
EXTD=llent, often overlooked originals like "I'll Always Know," "The S
EXTD=unny Side of My Life," and "You'll Never Love Me Now," which illu
EXTD=strate the progression in both Haggard's writing and his music, a
EXTD=nd help make Mama Tried one of his very best records. \n\nAs good
EXTD=as Mama Tried is, it's matched by Pride in What I Am. While ther
EXTD=e are no hits outside of "I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am" the
EXTD=album gains considerable strength from its diverse material. The
EXTD=rolling, folk-tinged sound epitomized by the title song is balan
EXTD=ced by twangy, spare country and bits of hard honky tonk, blues, 
EXTD=and cowboy, not to mention the slyly inventive arrangement on his
EXTD=version of Lefty Frizzell's "It Meant Goodbye to Me When You Sai
EXTD=d Hello to Him." There are also hints of the direction Hag would 
EXTD=take in the near future, including a Jimmie Rodgers song (his tri
EXTD=bute to the singing brakeman, Same Train, Different Time, would f
EXTD=ollow next), and the encroaching celebration of a time passed, th
EXTD=rough his cover of Red Simpson's "I Think We're Livin' in the Goo
EXTD=d Old Days." There is another Simpson cover in "Somewhere on Skid
EXTD=Row," but what fuels Pride in What I Am is a selection of gracef
EXTD=ul, low-key minor masterworks from Haggard himself, who explores 
EXTD=gentler territory with "The Day the Rains Came" and "I Can't Hold
EXTD=Myself in Line," while kicking up the tempo with the delightful 
EXTD="I'm Bringin' Home Good News" and lying back with the steady-roll
EXTD=ing "I Just Want to Look at You One More Time." None of these may
EXTD=be among his most commonly celebrated songs, but they're all sma
EXTD=ll gems that illustrate what a fine songwriter he is. They also h
EXTD=elp form the core of this subtly adventurous, rich album that may
EXTD=not be among his flashiest, but is another excellent record by o
EXTD=ne of the most reliable recording artists in country history. And
EXTD=when it's paired with Mama Tried, it makes for a two-fer that ve
EXTD=ry well may be the strongest disc in Capitol Nashville's initial 
EXTD=installment of Haggard reissues.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nA
EXTD=MG EXPERT REVIEW: (''Mama Tried'') Mama Tried is a typically fine
EXTD=late-'60s LP from Merle Haggard, comprised of a number of strong
EXTD=originals and several excellent covers. While "Mama Tried" stand
EXTD=s out among Haggard's original material, "I'll Always Know" and "
EXTD=You'll Never Love Me Now" are both solid songs. Still, those two 
EXTD=tracks pale next to the best covers on the record. Merle delivers
EXTD="Little Ole Wine Drinker Me," "In the Good Old Days (When Times 
EXTD=Were Bad)," "Teach Me to Forget," "Run 'Em Off" and "Too Many Bri
EXTD=dges to Cross Over" with grit and an open, affecting honesty that
EXTD=makes Mama Tried one of Hag's best records. -- Stephen Thomas Er
EXTD=lewine\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review (''Mama Tried'']\nOne great 
EXTD=album, January 30, 2002 \nReviewer: David Haglund from Oxford, En
EXTD=gland \nAn underappreciated gem (I can't believe there are no oth
EXTD=er reviews). Many critics call this Merle Haggard's best album-- 
EXTD=at least from the 60s-- and I tend to agree. It leads off with th
EXTD=e title track, a great Haggard original (Bob Weir used to sing th
EXTD=is with the Grateful Dead), and on this track as well as others, 
EXTD=the use of one acoustic and one electric guitar provides a sound 
EXTD=that both rocks and recalls traditional country. The band is exce
EXTD=llent and the production is pleasantly subdued-- no soaring strin
EXTD=g sections obscuring the other instruments. Another standout trac
EXTD=k is I'll Always Know, also a Haggard original. Covers of Cash's 
EXTD=Folsom Prison, and Green Grass of Home (which Cash did beautifull
EXTD=y on Live at Folsom Prison), while they can't unseat Cash's versi
EXTD=ons, are very good. Little Ol' Wine Drinker Me is excellent, and 
EXTD=Too Many Bridges to Cross Over is another highlight. Only Run 'Em
EXTD=Off is a dud, in my opinion. \n\n
