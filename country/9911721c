EXTD=Haggard catalog project, reissuing ten albums as a series of five

EXTD=also started working Jimmie Rodgers tunes into his recorded reper
EXTD=toire ("My Rough and Rowdy Ways" on I'm a Lonesome Fugitive), but
EXTD=the biggest development on these two records belonged to Haggard
EXTD=as a songwriter. On both records, he grew by leaps and bounds as
EXTD=a writer, penning such classics as the ghostly "House of Memorie
EXTD=s," "All of Me Belongs to You," "Someone Told My Story," "Skid Ro
EXTD=w," "I Threw Away the Rose," and "Branded Man," along with other 
EXTD=notable tunes like "Life in Prison," which consciously recalls hi
EXTD=s own life story. Since there's not much that separates these two
EXTD=albums in an aesthetic sense, they make for an excellent two-fer
EXTD=paired together, they play like one long, excellent album.  -- 
EXTD=Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: (''I'm A Lonesome F
EXTD=ugitive'') This early Capitol album contains the haunting "House 
EXTD=of Memories." Haggard begins to really let his roots show on this
EXTD=one -- see "Rough and Rowdy Ways," the Jimmie Rodgers classic. I
EXTD=n this great early period Haggard, while seeming entirely contemp
EXTD=orary, could evoke the Ghosts of Country Past in an absolutely co
EXTD=nvincing way without nostalgia or imitation. -- George Bedard\n\n
EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW: (''Branded Man'') Like Swinging Doors before i
EXTD=t, Branded Man/I Threw Away the Rose is merely a collection of so
EXTD=ngs pieced together to cash in on a couple of hit singles. Nevert
EXTD=heless, the intent of an album such as this doesn't really matter
EXTD=when the songs are this fine. In addition to the two title track
EXTD=s, Haggard co-writes "You Don't Have Very Far to Go" and "Somewhe
EXTD=re Between" (with Red Simpson and Bonnie Owens, respectively). Wh
EXTD=ile the latter isn't as good as his three other original songs ("
EXTD=Branded Man," "I Threw Away the Rose," "You Don't Have Very Far t
EXTD=o Go"), the remainder of the album is comprised of outside materi
EXTD=al that ranks among some of Haggard's finest performances ("Go Ho
