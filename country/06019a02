EXTD=f the Rolling Stones' original singles for Decca and London durin
EXTD=g the '60s seems not quite as impressive as the first two, there'
EXTD=s a reason for it: it's not. But that has little to do with eithe
EXTD=r the music -- some of the Stones' very best is here, including "
EXTD=Street Fighting Man," "Honky Tonk Women," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash
EXTD=," all viable contenders for the greatest rock and roll single ever
EXTD=- or the packaging, which is every bit as lavish and loving as 
EXTD=the first two installments. Instead, the problem is that the nine
EXTD=singles collected here are a bit of a hodgepodge. The aforementi
EXTD=oned trio are the group's last singles of the '60s, with the latt
EXTD=er two being the last two singles the band conceived as stand-alo
EXTD=ne 45s. After that, there were two singles pulled from the 1971 a
EXTD=lbum Sticky Fingers -- "Brown Sugar" and "Wild Horses," both back
EXTD=ed by album tracks (the former had a live version of Chuck Berry'
EXTD=s "Let It Rock" on a U.K. pressing, but that's not available here
EXTD=) -- and that LP is more commonly associated with the Stones' '70
EXTD=s albums for their own label, not their '60s work, so even if his
EXTD=torically they were part of the London years, they don't quite fe
EXTD=el like the end of this chapter - rather, they feel like the begin
EXTD=ning of the next. That accounts for half of Singles 1968-1971. Th
EXTD=e remaining five discs contain Mick Jagger's excellent solo singl
EXTD=e of "Memo from Turner" from the film Performance, two singles fr
EXTD=om the 1975 '60s rarities compilation Metamorphosis ("I Don't Kno
EXTD=w Why"/"Jiving Sister Fanny" and "I Don't Know Why"/"Try a Little
EXTD=Harder"), the "Sympathy for the Devil" single -- which was relea
EXTD=sed in the U.K. in 1976, but is presented in its 2003 form contai
EXTD=ning contemporary dance remixes by the Neptunes and Fatboy Slim, 
EXTD=variations that are, needless to say, rather incongruous in this 
EXTD=setting -- and, finally, a welcome bonus DVD containing the Stone
EXTD=s playing "Time Is On My Side" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, a
EXTD=live version of "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in th
EXTD=e Shadow?" from 1967, and the classic promo video for "Jumpin' Ja
EXTD=ck Flash" from 1968, as well as an out-of-place 2003 video for th
EXTD=e Neptunes' remix of "Sympathy for the Devil." While all these od
EXTD=ds and ends are nice to have, since they tie up any loose ends fr
EXTD=om this era, the end result doesn't have the narrative flow or th
EXTD=e rarities of the previous installments. That said, Singles 1968-
EXTD=1971 is a wonderful set for collectors, and it retains the high s
EXTD=tandard of the rest of the series.   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n

EXTD=, along with a booklet of informative liner notes, vintage photos
EXTD=, and promotional artwork.\n\nAlthough the "Jumpin' Jack Flash" B
EXTD=side, "Child of the Moon," finds the Stones still attempting to 
EXTD=keep pace with the Beatles (the song clearly echoes Lennon/McCart
EXTD=ney's "Rain"), the aforementioned A-side presents the group livin
EXTD=g up to their reputation as the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band
EXTD=with blazing abandon. Given Brian Jones's 1969 death and his sub
EXTD=sequent replacement by a young Mick Taylor, the era was clearly a
EXTD=transitional period for the Stones, and the music reflects this,
EXTD=most notably in the country twang of "Honky Tonk Women" and the 
EXTD=wistful "Wild Horses." A particular treat for Jagger fans is the 
EXTD=inclusion of his strutting "Memo from Turner" single, taken from 
EXTD=the film PERFORMANCE, along with the Ry Cooder instrumental "Natu
EXTD=ral Magic." The set also includes a "Sympathy for the Devil" sing

EXTD=STOMER REVIEW\n"The London Years" Compared To The 3 "Singles" Box
EXTD=Sets, June 12, 2006 \nBy  Mark Wilson (Huntington, WV USA]\n\nTh
EXTD=e purpose of this review is to completely compare the contents of
EXTD="Singles Collection: The London Years" to the 3 "Singles" box se
EXTD=ts which as a group contain the same songs plus more. There are s
EXTD=ome good comparisons in the other reviews, but also several omiss
EXTD=ions and inaccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will c
EXTD=lear things up a bit as to what songs are included on each, and w
EXTD=hich "missing" songs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, p
EXTD=articularly "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of t
EXTD=hese collections is rather expensive, so hopefully this may help 
EXTD=you decide which sets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one 
EXTD=thing first though, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP
EXTD=contained in the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on
EXTD=the full length CD "Got Live If You Want It". They share the sam
EXTD=e title but that's all, and were actually two different releases.
EXTD=Buying the full length CD will NOT get you all the same songs on
EXTD=the EP as indicated in another review. With that out of the way.
EXTD=\n\n"Singles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: The London Yea
EXTD=rs" contains all of the songs included in this box set, with the 
EXTD=exception of 3 original British EP's exclusive to the box set. Th
EXTD=e first EP contains You Better Move On (also available on "Decemb
EXTD=er's Children") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Johnny and Money (all 3 als
EXTD=o available on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The s
EXTD=econd EP (originally titled "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Emp
EXTD=ty Heart, 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Ar
EXTD=ound and Around, all of which are also available on the "12 X 5" CD
EXTD=The third EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") co
EXTD=ntains early live versions of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs
EXTD=Somebody To Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm
EXTD=Alright, none of which are available on any other CD (with the p
EXTD=ossible exception of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same
EXTD=version included on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConcl
EXTD=usion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the ea
EXTD=rly single/B-sides Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") a
EXTD=s well as I Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which 
EXTD=aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 so
EXTD=ngs not included elsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP
EXTD=So the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 
EXTD=63-65" would appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "
EXTD=Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs i
EXTD=ncluded in this 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Both contain the
EXTD=single/B-sides Long Long While and We Love You (also available on 
EXTD="More Hot Rocks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which a
EXTD=ren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 son
EXTD=gs not included elsewhere. No further conclusions. \n\n"Singles 1
EXTD=968-1971": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of
EXTD=the songs included in this 3rd box set, with a few unique except
EXTD=ions. The third box set additionally contains Everybody Needs Som
EXTD=ebody to Love (also available on "The Rolling Stones Now!") and t
EXTD=hree non-ABKCO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The 
EXTD=B-sides are the Ry Cooder instrumental Natural Magic (from the fi
EXTD=lm "Performance" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) an
EXTD=d Bitch and Sway which were the B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horse
EXTD=s. My guess is the licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Vi
EXTD=rgin Records, etc. and hadn't yet been negotiated when "The Londo
EXTD=n Years" was originally released back in 1989. The remixes appear
EXTD=to be 3 different "rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil.
EXTD=The box set also contains a bonus DVD (see the item description 
EXTD=for more on that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "S
EXTD=ingles 68-71" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also availabl
EXTD=e on "More Hot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also availa
EXTD=ble on "Hot Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between "The London
EXTD=Years" and "Singles 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKC
EXTD=O B-sides, the three remixes and the DVD contained in the box set
EXTD=\n\nFinal Conclusion: For the completest collector who has to h
EXTD=ave absolutely everything on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Bu
EXTD=y all 3 box sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" a
EXTD=nd the two box sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71" (a lot of d
EXTD=uplication, though "The London Years" runs a little cheaper than 
EXTD=the box sets and you don't have to change CD's as often). \n\nA sli
EXTD=ghtly cheaper option if you're mainly interested in completing th
EXTD=e ABKCO Rolling Stones "canon" not released on the regular studio
EXTD=full-length CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years
EXTD=" and "Singles 1963-1965". You'd only be missing the three non-AB
EXTD=KCO B-sides and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheap
EXTD=er option still, if you're only interested in the very early sing
EXTD=les and live EP and can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is 
EXTD=to buy "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 19
EXTD=63-1965". With those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Drivi
EXTD=ng Your Plane? and the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes.
EXTD=\n\nIn truth, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The Lo
EXTD=ndon Years" make an interesting listen because each is primarily 
EXTD=made up of A and B sides not included on the regular studio CD's. S
EXTD=o they're almost like listening to independent CD's without repea
EXTD=ting too many songs you'll hear when listening to the other album
EXTD=s. The 2nd disc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past 
EXTD=Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with different select
EXTD=ions of songs, so comparing these two further is highly recommend
EXTD=ed as well. \n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZ
EXTD=ON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA real gem for collectors, March 3, 2005 
EXTD=\nBy  Greg Pearce\n\nThis is the third and final installment of b
EXTD=ox sets covering the Stones singles released between 1963 - 1971.
EXTD=All three box sets are a treasure for stones collectors because 
EXTD=we get the original artwork for all the singles (and early EP's) 
EXTD=that the Stones released in the sixties. The cd's actually look l
EXTD=ike old 45's. This box set covering the years 1968 - 1971 has a c
EXTD=ool bonus dvd with several live performances and the classic old 
EXTD=Jumpin' Jack Flash video. However, this series of box sets is not
EXTD=for casual fans. The vast majority of songs can be found on the 
EXTD=old London Years box set which Abkco remastered in their 2002 Rol
EXTD=ling Stones remastered series. One omission on the singles 1968 -
EXTD=1971 box set is the live version of Let It Rock recorded at Leed
EXTD=s University in 1971 and originally released in the UK as the B s
EXTD=ide to Brown Sugar is not included. Apparently this is because Vi
EXTD=rgin owns the rights to that song. Bottom line is that all three 
EXTD=singles box sets are awesome if you want to have cd replicants of
EXTD=all the original 45's and the early EP's with their original art

EXTD=om The Fire" (New York]\n\nMore like 1968-76 with a touch of 2003
EXTD=, but let's not split hairs here. \n\nThere is more to celebrate 
EXTD=in this set as a bonus DVD with four chapters including the *Jump
EXTD=in' Jack Flash* video (with alternate audio take), an *Ed Sulliva
EXTD=n Show* appearance, and the *Have You Seen Your Mother...* video 
EXTD=are featured. \n\nAccordingly, fans are once again overcharged fo
EXTD=r this extravagance, this time to a tune of $55-60. All of these 
EXTD=images and songs could have been put together in a nice book and CD
EXTD=set for under $40 that could have avoided this cumbersome collec
EXTD=tion of pieces. The spectacular detail and craftsmanship however,
EXTD=make this -- as with the other sets -- a worthy collector's item
EXTD=down to the 'grooves' on the the top-side of the CD singles. Th
EXTD=e only disc on which the grooves do not belong is the 2003 SFTD C
EXTD=D single. Without a doubt, the inclusion of the rare *Street Figh
EXTD=ting Man* PS is a joy to own for most whom could not afford over 
EXTD=$10,000 for the real thing. \n\nAn even more exciting aspect of t
EXTD=his edition's *Street Fighting Man* is that it is the original (a
EXTD=nd alternate) single version which is otherwise unavailable by an
EXTD=y other legal means on CD. \n\nDespite the detail, there are glar
EXTD=ing omissions. Abkco did not include the alternate 'single' versi
EXTD=on of *Sway*, and one track was missed entirely: *Let It Rock [li
EXTD=ve]* from the UK 3-track *Brown Sugar* single. \n\nA 5-star colle
