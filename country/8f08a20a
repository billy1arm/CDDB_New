EXTD=Waylon is the best music has to offer!, March 12, 2005 \nBy  DanD
EXTD=\n\nARE YOU READY FOR THE COUNTRY is advertised at Waylon's "matu
EXTD=re" record, a transition from the outlaw status to the soft-heart
EXTD=ed, world-weary singer. Yet, there's still enough grit on this al
EXTD=bum to show that Waylon never lost his sandpaper edge, that he co
EXTD=uld easily combine he reknowned attitude with a heavy heart. \n\n
EXTD=Such songs as the Neil Young penned title track and the cover of 
EXTD=Marshal Tucker Band's "Can't You See" are heavy on the country/ro
EXTD=ck, while "Them Old Love Songs" is a slow country ballad that'll 
EXTD=take you back to the good ol' days. "Old Friend" is a tribute to 
EXTD=Waylon's late friend "Buddy Holly," while "Precious Memories" is 
EXTD=one of the few gospel tunes Waylon ever recorded (despite the fac
EXTD=t his voice was made to sing the genre). \n\nARE YOU READY FOR TH
EXTD=E COUNTRY has no downside to it. It is a collection of truly grea
EXTD=t songs sung by one of the best voices country music ever had to

EXTD=eady for the Country (1976) is mostly an album of thoughtful and 
EXTD=sentimental outlaw reflections, but it includes some songs that a
EXTD=re on the rowdy side, too. Waylon looks back through his past in 
EXTD=Old Friend, a song he wrote about Buddy Holly. Then he celebrates
EXTD=his wife in So Good Woman, and contemplates faith in the spiritu

EXTD=guy can rock, too. Waylon was a member of Buddy Holly's touring b

EXTD=his version sounds even better than Neil's. That's saying a lot c

EXTD=Waylon nails The Marshall Tucker Band's Can't You See, too, with 
EXTD=a spirited vocal performance and highly charged backup from his b
