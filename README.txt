"CD Database Server", "Internet CD Database Server", "CD Server", "Internet
CD Server", "CDDB Protocol Server" and "CDDB Server", are all copyright (c)
1996 by Steve Scherf.

For purposes of interpreting the GPL in connection with this work: The
database is distributed in the form of plain text files. These
will generally be processed into to another form.  The text form should 
be considered "source code" and the other form should be considered a
"compiled program".

A portion of this database is derived from the legacy xmcd-cddb-tarball,
which was created by Ti Kan and Steve Scherf. It was last updated 
November 1997.

Credit must go to Ti Kan (ti@amb.org) and Steve Scherf (steve@moonsoft.com)
for creating cddb, the CD database, and coming up with the idea of using 
the Internet to give users access to the database. 

Thanks go to the many system administrators who have volunteered the use of
their sites as public CD database servers. Without them this probably would
not have become so popular! Thanks also go to the many users who use the
servers every day and contribute to freedb.org by submitting new
database entries.
