EXTD=4 and 5]\n\nThe background for these two pages is a photograph (pe
EXTD=rhaps a composite of two or \nmore) depicting Elvis (on the right
EXTD=) singing into a 50's or 60's era stage or studio \nmicrophone.  
EXTD=He is wearing a suit (color cannot be determined because the phot
EXTD=o is in \nblack and white (or brown-tone)) and has a guitar suspe
EXTD=nded by a strap around his neck.  \nIt seems that his eyes are cl

EXTD=0 percent of the right page (but not covering the \nmicrophone or
EXTD=Elvis) is the quote: "I DON'T SOUND LIKE NOBODY." (See Peter \nG
EXTD=uralnick's comments from page 6, below.]\n\n\n(pages 6 and 7]\n\nTh
EXTD=e background for page 6 is a photograph of someone (apparently El
EXTD=vis) from below the \nshoulders down.  It appears that he (whoeve
EXTD=r is in the photo) is performing and is doing \n(or about to do) 
EXTD=the much talked about hip-wag movement that Elvis created.  The p
EXTD=erson \nin the photo is also holding a guitar on his right side s
EXTD=o as not to obstruct the view of his \nbody.\n\nIn large letters 
EXTD=covering 80 percent of the page is the quote: \n\n    "RHYTHM IS\n
EXTD=SOMETHING YOU\n     EITHER HAVE OR\n     DON'T HAVE,\n     B
EXTD=UT WHEN YOU\n     HAVE IT, YOU HAVE\n     IT ALL OVER."\n\nPage 7
EXTD=consists of a 5-paragraph introduction by Peter Guralnick (see c
EXTD=redits, below) as \nfollows:\n\nJust in case there is any lingeri
EXTD=ng doubt, one listen to this album should forever put to rest \nt
EXTD=he question of Elvis' musical significance, cultural impact, and 
EXTD=artistic achievement.  \nFrom "Heartbreak Hotel" to "Suspicious M
EXTD=inds," from "Hound Dog" to "Crying In The \nChapel," Elvis' #1 ch
EXTD=art hits display a multitude of moods, a variety of styles, and a
EXTD=n \nemotional range that defeat any attempt at typecasting or mus
EXTD=ical categorization.\n\nWho do you sound like? Elvis was asked wh
EXTD=en he first entered the Sun recording studio \nat the age of eigh
EXTD=teen.  "I don't sound like nobody," he replied.  And in response 
EXTD=to the \ninevitable follow-up question as to what kind of music h
EXTD=e sang, he simply responded, "I \nsing all kinds."\n\nThat turned
EXTD=out indeed to be the case.  Like so many great actors and singer
EXTD=s, Elvis \npossessed the capacity to imitate virtually anybody th
EXTD=at he admired - country and western \nsingers like Hank Snow, rhy
EXTD=thm and blues performers like Jackie Wilson, crooners like \nBing
EXTD=Crosby, gospel quartet singers like Jake Hess. But in the end he
EXTD=came out sounding \nlike nobody but himself, whether he was sing
EXTD=ing a tremulous ballad like "Love Me \nTender" or an all-out rock
EXTD=er like "Jailhouse Rock."  He possessed a gift, in the words \nof
EXTD=Jake Hess, virtuoso lead singer for Elvis' favorite gospel group
EXTD=, the Statesmen, for \npouring himself into a song, "he just seem
EXTD=ed to live every word of it."\n\nSome of the songs on this album 
EXTD=are so familiar it can be difficult at times to recall the \nimme
EXTD=diacy of their initial impact.  Some of the pleasure we take in t
EXTD=hem derives from \nmemory, of course, but I think if we can set a
EXTD=side for a moment the context in which they \nwere first heard, t
EXTD=he freshness, the originality, the emotional truth, the sheer fun
EXTD=of them \nwill surely come through.\n\nElvis Presley helped ushe
EXTD=r in a revolution.  He was a true believer in the democratic \ndr
EXTD=eam, and we continue to be swept up in that same sense of unabash
EXTD=ed striving that he \nstood for, that belief in freedom and unlim
EXTD=ited possibilities that his music proclaims.\n\n     PETER GURALN
EXTD=ICK\n\n\n(page 8]\n\nThis page consists of a collage of 4 images.
EXTD=In the center and foreground is a shiny chromed \nboom microphon
EXTD=e with the end of the boom in view overhead.  The left half of th
EXTD=e collage is \na retouched photograph of Elvis' head exhibiting o
EXTD=ne of his serious (nearly expressionless) \nlooks, his hair with 
EXTD=the very recognizable waxed-wave appearance and his chin and chee
EXTD=ks \nbaby-bottom smooth.  On the right is an early photo of Elvis
EXTD=on stage in front of a curtain, \nholding a microphone in his ri
EXTD=ght hand with a guitar hanging freely on the strap about his \nne
EXTD=ck. It appears he may be sitting on a stool, his eyes are closed,
EXTD=and the viewer is enticed \nto remember the sounds created by th
EXTD=e person depicted in the photo.\n\n\n(pages 9, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 1
EXTD=7]\n\nThese pages contain narratives for each of the thirty songs
EXTD=in the album (not including the \nbonus track).  For each song, 
EXTD=the release date for the song is given and a short (2 to 5 line) 
EXTD=\nhistory about the song (or events surrounding it) is presented.
EXTD=The content of these \nnarratives is included in the extra trac
EXTD=k information for each song respectively.\n\nTwo of the pages con
EXTD=taining the track narratives (pages 10 and 11 specifically) conta
EXTD=in \nbackground images consisting of two photographs of Elvis.  T
EXTD=he photo on page 10 depicts \nhim in dark colored high-water styl
EXTD=e jeans, penny loafers and white socks, a horizontally-\nstriped 
EXTD=zippered shirt and dark colored (perhaps leather) jacket.  The ba
EXTD=ckground image \non page 11 shows him in a totally gold-metallic 
EXTD=suit with gold shoes (one of his well known \ncostumes).  Both im
EXTD=ages show him only from mid-abdomen, down.\n\n\n(page 12]\n\nThis
EXTD=page is made up of another collage of images of Elvis.  On the l
EXTD=eft we see his left hand \nholding a microphone while he is on st
EXTD=age.  On the right we see his face in one of his very \nrecogniza
EXTD=ble expressions while singing.  In the center is one-half (his ri
EXTD=ght side) of a photo \ntaken while he was in the military service
EXTD=He is shown in a dress uniform with dress cap, \ncoat and tie.
EXTD=\n\n\n(page 14]\n\nThe quote: "AMBITION IS A DREAM WITH A V8 ENGI
EXTD=NE." covers a photograph of Elvis \n(again minus his head and sho
EXTD=ulders) wearing matching white shirt and slacks with \nornamental
EXTD=buckles sewn along the seams of both.\n\n\n(page 16]\n\nOnce aga
EXTD=in we see a collage of three photos.  On the upper left is Elvis 
EXTD=(with head visible) \nin one of his wide-cuff-and-collar outfits 
EXTD=holding a microphone in his right hand.  No guitar \nis visible, 
EXTD=but a lei (flowered necklace from Hawaii) hangs around his neck. 
EXTD=On the lower \nleft we see a portion of the body of Elvis' guita
EXTD=r, the same one shown on pages 2 and 3.  On \nthe right is another 
EXTD=retouched photo of Elvis, nearly expressionless, in gold-tone.\n\n
EXTD=\n(pages 18 and 19]\n\nThese pages present a list of the thirty tra
EXTD=cks from the CD giving the track number, name, \nrunning time, wr
EXTD=iter, publisher, collaborative performers, recording date, and ch
EXTD=art statistics.  \nThis information is included with the narrativ
EXTD=es (discussed earlier) in the extra track \ninformation for each 
EXTD=song respectively.\n\nThe background for these two pages is the s
EXTD=ame gold-tone used for the cover.  The \nprinted text is all in w
EXTD=hite.\n\n\n(page 20]\n\nTo compile a disc of Elvis' number one hi
EXTD=ts is a musical delight, to limit it to 80 minutes \nis a headach
EXTD=e, and to look at the list of didn't-make-its is close to heartac
EXTD=he.\n\nWe have chosen to select number ones from the official U.S
EXTD=and U.K. pop charts, and \ndebate on what counts and what doesn
EXTD='t becomes somewhat clouded when comparing \ncompeting charts fro
EXTD=m Billboard, Cashbox, New Musical Express and Record Retailer.\n\n
EXTD=With further research, even the starting point is open for interp
EXTD=retation.  "That's All Right"/ \n"Blue Moon Of Kentucky" was Elvi
EXTD=s' first record for the independent Sun Records label, \nand the 
EXTD=b-side was number one in Memphis in September, 1954.  If charts w
EXTD=ere available \nfor Gladewater, Texas or Shreveport, Louisiana or
EXTD=Sheffield, Alabama, "That's All Right" \nmight well have turned 
EXTD=up at number one in all those places.\n\nThe country chart provid
EXTD=ed Elvis with 11 number one hits - seven of which were also pop \n
EXTD=number ones.  "I Forgot To Remember To Forget" hit number one on 
EXTD=the Billboard country \nchart two months before "Heartbreak Hotel
EXTD=" did the same on the pop chart.  His other \nnumber ones in the 
EXTD=country field were "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You," "Moody \n
EXTD=Blue" and a 1980 remix of "Guitar Man."\n\nElvis' six number ones
EXTD=on the Billboard R&B chart included "Wear My Ring Around Your \n
EXTD=Neck," which "only" reached number three on the pop chart.  "Houn
EXTD=d Dog," "Don't Be \nCruel," "All Shook Up," "Teddy Bear" and "Jai
EXTD=lhouse Rock" were number one on the pop, \nC&W and R&B charts.\n\n
EXTD=It wasn't until "All Shook Up" that Elvis got his first U.K. numb
EXTD=er one.  In England, four of \nElvis' singles became double-sided
EXTD=number ones.  We have chosen to include the U.S. top \nsides for
EXTD=these four in favor of "I Need Your Love Tonight," "I Got Stung,
EXTD=" "Little Sister" \nand "Rock-A-Hula Baby."\n\nElvis' reign at th
EXTD=e top of the charts takes on an even more spectacular angle when 
EXTD=you look \nat the number of weeks he spent there.  Elvis claimed 
EXTD=the number one spot in the U.S. for \n24 weeks in 1956, only to t
EXTD=op that the following year with 26 weeks - half of the year.  He 
EXTD=\nmanaged another 15 weeks at number one in 1960, upon his return
EXTD=from the army.\n\nAdditional charts from all over the world will
EXTD=undoubtedly reveal many more Elvis number \nones, but at The RCA
EXTD=Records Label we are proud to present, for the first time, 30 U.
EXTD=S. \nand U.K. number one hits in one collection - an unparalleled
EXTD=achievement in music history \nand a wonderful introduction to t
EXTD=he ever-fascinating music of Elvis Presley.\n\n     -- Ernst Mika
