EXTD=1965-1967 covers the classic period between "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "In Another Land," the time when the Stones started to reach beyond their hard blues base, and created some of their most indelible music. Like the previous box, Singles
EXTD=1963-1965, each of the group's British and American singles and EPs are represented, reproduced in paper sleeves and pressed on all-black CDs designed to look like a 45. Where that set had some rarities -- including the first release of such classic
EXTD=EPs as The Rolling Stones, 5 X 5, and Got Live If You Want It! -- every cut on this box has been on CD before (all showed up on the triple-disc The Singles Collection: The London Years) and there is a slight tweaking of history here, with certain si
EXTD=ngles (like "Satisfaction," "Get Off of My Cloud," and "Paint It, Black") containing both the American and British B-sides. This may upset some purists, but it's a clever, efficient way to cover this ground - plus, even with the added song these discs
EXTD=run well under ten minutes, so it's a nice bonus that beefs up the discs slightly and makes them more listenable. Of course, this isn't designed for listenability in the first place, since changing the 11 discs is cumbersome, even with a multi-disc 
EXTD=player -- it's really a set to look at and admire, to gaze at each of the picture sleeves. But, if they're listened to a disc at a time, it does reveal what a splendid singles band the Rolling Stones were. There has never been a single as snide and c
EXTD=ynical as "Satisfaction" backed by "The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man," while there has never been one as nasty and antisocial as "Paint It, Black" b/w "Stupid Girl," and their rebel reputation was cemented by "Get Off of My Cloud" b/w "I'
EXTD=m Free." These are revelations that this set makes clear through its singles replicas, and it helps make this set a necessary purchase for the hardcore.  -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Product Description\nThe Second of Three Stunning Box

EXTD=ndon Years" to the 3 "Singles" box sets which as a group contain the same songs plus more. There are some good comparisons in the other reviews, but also several omissions and inaccuracies, so hopefully this 1-to-1 comparison will clear things up a b
EXTD=it as to what songs are included on each, and which "missing" songs can also be found on the other ABKCO CD's, particularly "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies". Each of these collections is rather expensive, so hopefully this may help you deci
EXTD=de which sets you really need or want. \n\nTo settle one thing first though, the songs on the "Got Live If You Want It" EP contained in the "Singles 1963-1965" box set are NOT included on the full length CD "Got Live If You Want It". They share the s
EXTD=ame title but that's all, and were actually two different releases. Buying the full length CD will NOT get you all the same songs on the EP as indicated in another review. With that out of the way..... \n\n"Singles 1963-1965": "Singles Collection: Th
EXTD=e London Years" contains all of the songs included in this box set, with the exception of 3 original British EP's exclusive to the box set. The first EP contains You Better Move On (also available on "December's Children") and Poison Ivy, Bye Bye Joh
EXTD=nny and Money (all 3 also available on "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies"). The second EP (originally titled "5 X 5") contains If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 South Michigan Avenue, Confessin' The Blues and Around and Around, all of which are a
EXTD=lso available on the "12 X 5" CD. The third EP (the afore mentioned "Got Live If You Want It") contains early live versions of We Want The Stones, Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, Pain In My Heart, Route 66, I'm Movin On and I'm Alright, none of which
EXTD=are available on any other CD (with the possible exception of I'm Alright which may or may not be the same version included on the full-length "Got Live..." CD). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" contain the early single/B-
EXTD=sides Come On (also available on "More Hot Rocks") as well as I Want To Be Loved, I Wanna Be Your Man and Stoned which aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 3 songs not included elsewhere, plus the box set includes the live EP. S
EXTD=o the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 63-65" would appear to be the live EP. \n\n"Singles 1965-1967": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this 2nd box set, with no exceptions. Both cont
EXTD=ain the single/B-sides Long Long While and We Love You (also available on "More Hot Rocks") and Sad Day and Who's Driving Your Plane? which aren't available on any other ABKCO CD. So both sets contain 2 songs not included elsewhere. No further conclusion
EXTD=s. \n\n"Singles 1968-1971": "Singles Collection: The London Years" contains all of the songs included in this 3rd box set, with a few unique exceptions. The third box set additionally contains Everybody Needs Somebody to Love (also available on "The 
EXTD=Rolling Stones Now!") and three non-ABKCO B-sides and 3 remixes exclusive to the box set. The B-sides are the Ry Cooder instrumental Natural Magic (from the film "Performance" soundtrack...Memo From Turner was the A-side) and Bitch and Sway which were th
EXTD=e B-sides to Brown Sugar and Wild Horses. My guess is the licensing rights to these B-sides belong to Virgin Records, etc. and hadn't yet been negotiated when "The London Years" was originally released back in 1989. The remixes appear to be 3 different
EXTD="rap" style remixes of Sympathy For The Devil. The box set also contains a bonus DVD (see the item description for more on that). \n\nConclusion: Both "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" contain the B-side Child Of The Moon (also available on "Mo
EXTD=re Hot Rocks") and Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (also available on "Hot Rocks 1"). So the deciding factor between "The London Years" and "Singles 68-71" would appear to be the three non-ABKCO B-sides, the three remixes and the DVD contained in the box s
EXTD=et. \n\nFinal Conclusion: For the completest collector who has to have absolutely everything on CD, you basically have 2 choices. Buy all 3 box sets, or buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and the two box sets "Singles 63-65" and "Singles 68-71"
EXTD=(a lot of duplication, though "The London Years" runs a little cheaper than the box sets and you don't have to change CD's as often). \n\nA slightly cheaper option if you're mainly interested in completing the ABKCO Rolling Stones "canon" not released
EXTD=on the regular studio full-length CD's is to buy "Singles Collection: The London Years" and "Singles 1963-1965". You'd only be missing the three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 Sympathy For The Devil remixes. \n\nA cheaper option still, if you're only i
EXTD=nterested in the very early singles and live EP and can live without a few later ABKCO B-Sides, is to buy "More Hot Rocks: Big Hits and Fazed Cookies" and "Singles 1963-1965". With those 2 you'd only be missing Sad Day, Who's Driving Your Plane? and the 
EXTD=three non-ABKCO B-sides and the 3 remixes. \n\nIn truth, the 2nd and 3rd discs of "Singles Collection: The London Years" make an interesting listen because each is primarily made up of A and B sides not included on the regular studio CD's. So they're alm
EXTD=ost like listening to independent CD's without repeating too many songs you'll hear when listening to the other albums. The 2nd disc from "More Hot Rocks" and also "Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)" do the same, only with different selection
EXTD=s of songs, so comparing these two further is highly recommended as well. \n\nDecisions, decisions. Hope this helps. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe Stones As The World First Heard Them!, November 16, 2004 \nBy  Robert L. Smith (San Francisco, 
EXTD=CA United States]\n\nIn Britain in the 1960s, albums did not occupy the preeminent position in the distribution of popular music that CDs do today. Most record buyers bought singles (two songs) or EPs ("Extended Plays," 4-5 songs), which were cheaper
EXTD=, and in any case, usually filled in the gap between albums, and featured songs which would not reappear on the LP. Thus, the most famous of the Rolling Stones' early work was originally heard on this format. This excellent reissue presents the singl
EXTD=es as they were first issued, including cardboard reproductions of the original picture sleeves. The opaque black CDs--a new experience for me--really do resemble old vinyl records, and the sound quality is absolutely phenomenal! This second set of s
EXTD=ingles documents a particularly creative period for the band, and is frankly better than its predecessor because (by and large) the material rises to another level. Both sets are excellent, however, and truly necessary for hardcore Stones fans. It ta
EXTD=kes awhile to listen to twenty-some CDs that contain only a few songs each, but it's worth the effort to experience these classic tracks as the world first heard them. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nfive stars for collectors!!!!, March 15, 2005 \n
EXTD=By  Greg Pearce\n\nThis is the second of three limited edition box sets that Abkco is releasing. They are great for collectors because we get the original artwork along with the singles and early ep's. If you just want the music that's covered by the
EXTD=se discs then just buy the London Years Box Set that Abkco remastered in 2002. These box sets are for people who want replicas of the Stones singles and Ep's from the 1960's complete with the original artwork. These sets are for collectors. To the gu
EXTD=y that said the Stones will put out anything for money well they have no control over their music from 1963 to 1971. Allen Klein puts all this stuff out. Sure the Stones still make some money off it but they have no say as to whether this stuff gets

EXTD=fans and collectors who are the target market for these 3 sets care about the duplication of most of this material on other discs/sets? Yes -- I, too just spent about $500 with tax and shipping from various places assembling the whole set of ABKCO S
EXTD=ACD's. \n\nRemember, it's not about return on investment - this stuff is art and art is inherently SUBJECTIVE AND AESTHETIC!!! The packaging manages to both fit in a standard retailer's CD rack and also give the buyer a sense of perceived value. An e
EXTD=xtra plus is that the mini-replica sleeves and the outer box are high-gloss paper, which resists better the greasy fingerprints that even avowed "collectors" will leave behind after being unable to resist the lure of handling these sets. \n\nAlso, ca
EXTD=ll me crazy, but the sound quality, in my humble opinion, is better than the 2002 SACD's. As I understand it, these are DSD mastered, but there is no SACD layer. Maybe the DSD mastering WITHOUT the extra SACD layer did the trick, no matter how much S

EXTD=looks as though ABKCO is doing a few thigs right. THEY DID A FANTASTIC JOB ON THE REMASTERED CD collection. THEY SEEM TO BE CONTINUING THIS RENEWED INTEREST IN presenting the greatest Rock N Roll band in an appropriate light. The packaging of both ne

EXTD=booklets are also an added treat. However, ABKCO does not know the history of the band very well. They continue to press the wrong versions of songs on their records and CD'S. This trend has been continuing for more than 25 years! It's really amazing
EXTD=that they can never get it straight. To this day they have still failed to issue the TRUE STEREO versions of hits like SATISFACTION and GET OFF MY CLOUD. They claim thay they have,but it's a farse. The only place you can get the TRUE STEREO versions
EXTD=is on import albums and cd's released overseas in the 70's and 80's. In addition, this box set should be entirely in MONO. All singles during the 60's were released in MONO or SIMULATE STEREO which is also a farse! They might also try releasing some
EXTD=outakes of some of the BIG HITS, or maybe some vintage video during the 60's. They are still the only major band from the 60's that does not have some sort of outakes CD or DVD! The bottom line is we love the packaging,but we have these songs 100 ti

EXTD=Best of the Rolling Stones in a Great Package!, January 11, 2007 \nBy  Dale Coovert (St Petersburg, FL]\n\nOK, let me start by acknowledging that I'm one of those people who believe that The Rolling Stones ceased to be relevant after Brian Jones died
EXTD=So there's that. Also, I bought many of these singles back in the day in the original picture sleeves (including the EPs which I bought direct from a supplier in England). So seeing them in miniature after all these years (my record collection is l
EXTD=ong gone) was a treat. Also, I'm basically boycotting those ridiculous Rolling Stones reissue CDs that offer nothing to me as a consumer that I didn't have on my original LPs 40 years ago. (Man, has it been that long?) So, given all that, I was thril
EXTD=led when this set was (finally) issued. The years 1965-1967 are (to me) the Golden Age of The Rolling Stones - their artistic peak years. The songs included in this set are almost all classics. The packaging is fabulously fun. I love the idea of pack
EXTD=aging the CDs as miniature versions of the old 45s (much like the earlier Kinks sets) and the booklet is actually informative. So skip those insulting reissues (until somebody is willing to do them up right with bonus tracks and a meaningful booklet)

EXTD=We got it. She's a Rainbow? Yeah. \nOkay, so some of this hasn't held up well. There's a good reason why some b-sides have been lost to history, and the In Another Land/The Lantern single has been justly forgotten. Oh well, still pretty good. \n\nOh,
