EXTD=IEW: A companion piece to the luminous Workingman's Dead, America
EXTD=n Beauty is an even stronger document of the Grateful Dead's retu
EXTD=rn to their musical roots. Sporting a more full-bodied and intric
EXTD=ate sound than its predecessor thanks to the addition of subtle e
EXTD=lectric textures, the record is also more representative of the g
EXTD=roup as a collective unit, allowing for stunning contributions fr
EXTD=om Dave Torbert (the poignant opener "Box of Rain") and Bob Weir 
EXTD=("Sugar Magnolia") - at the top of his game as well is Jerry Garci
EXTD=a, who delivers the superb "Friend of the Devil," "Candyman" and 
EXTD="Ripple." Climaxing with the perennial "Truckin'," American Beaut
EXTD=y remains the Dead's studio masterpiece -- never again would they
EXTD=be so musically focused or so emotionally direct. -- Jason Anken

EXTD=in over many an anti-Jerry. Bewildered by loss both personal and 
EXTD=social--the hippie dream was quickly crashing by Beauty's 1970 re

EXTD=ber 25, 2000 \nReviewer: Jinglebell Rainbow (see more about me) \n
EXTD=What else can be said about this album? Because the album is wort
EXTD=h listening to over and over, so is reading, writting and talking
EXTD=about it. The vocals on Attics of my Life are the best the dead 
EXTD=ever produced on any album. They are perfect. All the songs are e
EXTD=xpertly written and performed. Ripple is one of the best true-blu
EXTD=e American folk songs ever written. The melody meshes perfectly w
EXTD=ith the words which gives the feeling of optimisim, hope and pure
EXTD=happiness. The song Till the Morning Comes (which never made it 
EXTD=into the regular concert rotation) is an excellent rendition. The
EXTD=sound is joyful and very peppy. Box of Rain is a song by Robert 
EXTD=Hunter and Phil Lesh which was wriiten at the time of Lesh's fath
EXTD=er's dying of cancer. As a matter of fact, Garcia's mother and Bo
EXTD=b Weir's Parents had also passed away at the time. All the emotio
EXTD=n and passion for life were put into this album. This is the "Cro
EXTD=wn Jewel" of recordings in American folk music, not just for the 
EXTD=Grateul Dead. Other songs of note are Candyman and Friend of a De
EXTD=vil. Again, Garcia sings beautifully. His voice is young,fresh, a
EXTD=nd full of heartfelt passion. This album is not at all like the l
EXTD=ive concerts the band was playing at the time. Some shows had acu
EXTD=stic sets but the electric sets were like entering a war zone of 
EXTD=Fire Breathing Dragons. The sound on American Beauty is rich, war
EXTD=m and very inviting. This is a testiment to the incrediable versa
EXTD=tility of this remarkable band of very fine musicians. Special no
EXTD=te goes to David Grisman and Howard Wales for adding texture with
EXTD=mandolin and keyboards respectivly.\n\nRolling Stone (12/24/70, 
EXTD=p. 52) - "...the album is American beauty of the best possible ki
EXTD=nd....A complete contentment shines through the vocal work....The
EXTD=instrumentation is rich with sound that moves through, under and
EXTD=into the listener..." \n\nCD Connection.com Review\nGrateful Dea

EXTD=he Purple Sage. \n\nRecorded at Wally Heider Studios, San Francis
EXTD=co, California. \n\nAMERICAN BEAUTY was an instant classic when i
EXTD=t was first released November of 1970. It is among the most satis

EXTD=nding as it does on the engaging mix of country, blues and folk m
EXTD=aterials they first coined earlier in the year with WORKINGMAN'S 
EXTD=DEAD. \n\nThe musical vision of the Dead is more sharply focused 
EXTD=on AMERICAN BEAUTY--from the serene reflection and compassion of 
EXTD=the opening "Box Of Rain" and the bluesy mysticism of "Ripple," t
EXTD=o the sensual rock of "Sugar Maganolia" and the anthemic proto-bo
EXTD=ogie of the closing "Truckin." \n\nBut then, every tune on AMERIC
EXTD=AN BEAUTY has attained a classic resonance, both from 20-plus yea
EXTD=rs of steady airplay, and the way the Dead seem to continually re
EXTD=vive these popular standards for their concert repertoire.
