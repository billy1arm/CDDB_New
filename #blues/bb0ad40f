EXTD=Baker effort. The Davis disc features mellow trumpeting from 1957-65 or so, and has no songs in common with "Chet and Strings." I own both, and I like both artists, but the Baker is definitely better for casual listening while romancing or relaxing. 
EXTD=The Davis CD is simply less interesting and too bland, something that certainly could not be said about much in his catalogue. Chet came to mass popularity before Miles, but Davis beat heroin in 1954 and the drug finally killed Baker in the 80's, des
