EXTD="Rock Me Baby"), some very good live numbers ("Bony Moronie," "Go

EXTD=my favorite cuts are the live songs. "Good Morning Little School
EXTD=girl", "Bony Moronie", "It's All Over Now" and a smokin' cover of
EXTD=Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited" are among the highlights. Ano
EXTD=ther interesting cut is Winter's version of Rick Derringer's "Roc

EXTD=in Winter's band. The music is great mixture of rock and Texas bl
EXTD=ues with Winter's stinging guitar at the forefront. He is master 
EXTD=of slide guitar both electric and on his National Steel guitar wh
EXTD=en he elects to play acoustically. Brother Edgar appears on some 
EXTD=cuts as well as Muddy Waters on Winter's version of "Walking Thru
EXTD=The Park". My regrets are that each disk is not even an hour in 
EXTD=length. No material from his albums "John Dawson Winter III" or "
EXTD=White, Hot And Blue" or his Woodstock performances are included. 
EXTD=The set also does not include any of Winter's covers of Rolling S
EXTD=tones tunes like "Jumpin' Jack Flash", "Silver Train", "Let It Bl

EXTD=d are a couple of blues cover tunes like "Walkin' By Myself" and 
EXTD="Messin With The Kid" which I miss. This remains an effective ove
EXTD=rview of Winter's Columbia period. I would also recommend "Deluxe
