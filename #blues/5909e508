EXTD=tour was not to be). However, not everyone was so impressed. In fact, there are choruses of boos that follow nearly every tune. Vaughan was basically a nobody at the time, playing very electric blues at the end of a mostly acoustic program. But he h

EXTD=ly never lets up. Even at this stage, his tone and style are pretty close to fully formed, and it's easy to see how he could become the guitar hero he ended up being. \n\nThe 1985 show is quite a contrast. Vaughan had become a star, and it shows in 
EXTD=so many ways. He had developed more of a stage persona, with showier moves and infinitely more presence as a frontman. He's also dressed to the hilt, looking like some sort of '80s cowboy-pimp with a ridiculous hat, multiple scarfs, and gigantic ear
EXTD=ring. Heck, even Whipper Layton is sporting fancier '80s pants and a big earring, and Tommy Shannon's hat is more extravagant than the 1982 show as well. Double Trouble also now included Reese Wynans on keyboards, which, along with Vaughan's additio

EXTD=nny Copeland. Vaughan seems a bit worn out, and it wouldn't be long before he got sober. Even so, there are clear moments of brilliance and this time the audience is fully behind him. Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985 is a vital document for fans, showin

EXTD=the Austin club scene, the band displays their nervous energy in a set that contains several previously unreleased/rare gems from SRV's early repertoire, including the Hound Dog Taylor romp "Give Me Back My Wig." By the time of this set's second dis
EXTD=c, recorded just three years later, SRV was a worldwide star, the boos had turned to rousing cheers, and Vaughan's nervousness was replaced by an incendiary swagger he seemed all too happy to push into the crowd's faces. With the band (drummer Chris
EXTD=Layton, bassist Tommy Shannon) now augmented by Reese Wynans on organ and guest guitarist Johnny Copeland sitting in on "Tin Pan Alley," the triumphant show (11 of the 15 songs are included here) centered on the cream of SRV's first three studio al

EXTD=Editorial Review (2DVD Collection]\nIf you have even a passing interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's peerless mastery of urban blues guitar, you must own Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985. Spaced almost exactly three years apart, these concerts (60 and 93 mi
EXTD=nutes, respectively) represent the Texan blues god at his fiery best, with Double Trouble (drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon) laying the solid foundation upon which SRV built a Fender-driven sound as fierce as it was perfectly refined. 
EXTD=The '82 show was truly "success in disguise," because despite booing from a festival audience lulled by a day of acoustic blues, and the stunned dejection that SRV felt after persevering through a uncompromising set, this was the turning point in SR
EXTD=V's career, leading to post-show encounters with Jackson Browne and David Bowie, who proved instrumental in bringing Stevie's music to an appreciative global audience.\n\nWhen Stevie, Chris, and Tommy returned to Switzerland three years later, with 
EXTD=organist Reese Wynans adding rich new dimension to the Double Trouble sound, the Montreux crowd was primed for a rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubilant response is a joyous thing to witness. One of SRV's favorite bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appears for
