EXTD=EVIEW:  After achieving moderate success with their self-titled d
EXTD=ebut, Ambrosia decided to up the ante by going for a bigger, more
EXTD=symphonic sound on this follow-up outing. To achieve this goal, 
EXTD=they enlisted Alan Parsons, who mixed their first album, to produ
EXTD=ce and Andrew Powell (arranger for the Alan Parsons Project) to d
EXTD=o full-blown orchestral arrangements on a number of the tracks. T
EXTD=he resulting album lacks the careful fusion of pop and prog eleme
EXTD=nts that characterized Ambrosia, with songs tending to fall into 
EXTD=either progressive or soft rock categories. Just the same, it is 
EXTD=a strong album with a number of sonically arresting moments. The 
EXTD=finest songs are the most overtly progressive, the most dazzling 
EXTD=being "Danse With Me, George," a tribute to Chopin that leads the
EXTD=listener through a bewildering array of styles (classical, jazz,
EXTD=and pop, to name just a few) in just under eight minutes. "Cowbo
EXTD=y Star" is another knockout, bringing its tale of a city dweller 
EXTD=who dreams of cowboy glory to life with a beautiful orchestral mi
EXTD=d-section that is strongly reminiscent of Aaron Copland. None of 
EXTD=the straightforward pop songs are as catchy or instantly memorabl
EXTD=e as "Holdin' on to Yesterday," but "Runnin' Away" presents an ap
EXTD=pealing blend of carefully arranged harmonies and acoustic sounds
EXTD=, and "We Need You Too" provides the album with a suitably statel
EXTD=y finale by building from a piano-led solo ballad into a cascade 
EXTD=of soaring strings and harmony vocals. All in all, Somewhere I've

EXTD=he superb production of the ubiquitous Alan Parsons, the album ne
EXTD=ver ceases to sparkle and entertain. Inside this musical scrapboo
EXTD=k are two potential followups to last year's hit, "Holdin' On to 
EXTD=Yesterday." They are "Danse with Me George," a song to George Har

EXTD=Copeland -, December 15, 2000 \nBy  "captain_wave" (Santa Clarit

EXTD=Star". On these two songs, Ambrosia embraces us with their virtuo
EXTD=sity and their masterful use of the progressive/classical rock me
EXTD=dium. Further on in the album, Ambrosia takes us to Africa with t
EXTD=he wild safari tune, "The Blunt" and then to --God who knows wher
EXTD=e-- (France maybe?) with their wild and wacky "Danse with Me Geor
EXTD=ge". On these two tunes, Ambrosia shows us their humorous and cre
EXTD=ative use of the art-rock form. I loved this album when it first 
EXTD=came out on vinyl during the 70's with its pyramid foldout album 
EXTD=cover. And, over the years the music has proven its worth by stil
EXTD=l sounding "progressive" to this day...the only songs that sound 
EXTD=dated were the obvious "disco-like" attempts to have a hit single
EXTD=(probably by pressure of the record label). I still give this al
EXTD=bum "5 stars" primarily for the above mentioned songs but the ent
EXTD=ire album is very listenable and pallatible overall. I highly rec
EXTD=ommend their first self-titled album too! It is probably a much m
EXTD=ore cohesive album from a progressive-rock viewpoint but "Somewhe
EXTD=re.." still belongs in any progressive-rock fan's CD collection. 
EXTD=Unlike "Hugh" below, I believe that most progressive or art-rock 
EXTD=isn't "crap" so I am a bit biased towards that end of the rock sp
EXTD=ectrum. :) \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nBrilliant--and sadly
EXTD=overlooked., April 30, 2004 \nBy  Richard D. Hodgson (Madera, CA
EXTD=United States]\n\nThis album was out of print for many years, an
EXTD=d now that it's been reissued on CD, you'd better buy it before i
EXTD=t's gone again. I've owned this on vinyl since the 70's. The orig
EXTD=inal LP had a cool jacket which could be folded (without damage) 
EXTD=to form a pyramid. This was not duplicated on the CD version, but
EXTD=it couldn't be done with a standard jewel case, and after all, i
EXTD=t is a budget-priced CD, so I won't complain too much. What's imp
EXTD=ortant is the music inside! After this album the band degenerated
EXTD=into baically a bland, syrupy pop group (probably under pressure
EXTD=from their new label), and unfortunately that's how they're reme
EXTD=mbered by a lot of people. But their first two albums were great,
EXTD=and this one is their masterpiece. I really don't think it sold 
EXTD=too well when it was originally released-- probably because it wa
EXTD=s over a lot of people's heads musically. Think a mixture of Quee
EXTD=n and The Moody Blues, seasoned with a touch of Frank Zappa. Havi
EXTD=ng been produced by Alan Parsons (which may help to explain the p
EXTD=yramid connection), the sound is outstanding. It's a bit challeng
EXTD=ing to listen to-- but the most "difficult" songs, notably "Cowbo
EXTD=y Star" and "Danse With Me George" will probably become your favo
EXTD=rite cuts in the long run. And the closing cut, "We Need You Too"
EXTD=is absolutely gorgeous. There are also a couple of great rockers
EXTD=on the album, and both of them received some radio play. But it'
EXTD=s what lies between that really shines. It's become fasionable to
EXTD=put down "prog rock" as overindulgant and often collapsing under
EXTD=its own weight-- and that was often the case. But this is a trul
EXTD=y brilliant album by a talented and underrated band, and if you d
EXTD=ismiss it out of hand then you do yourself a great disservice. Ch

EXTD=some might dismiss this as a poor sophomore effort, it charters n

EXTD=(Mentor, OH United States]\n\nIt's difficult in retrospect to be
EXTD=overly critical of a record made in a style which is dated by de
EXTD=finition, but a lot of the material here ranges from self-indulge
EXTD=nt to just plain silly. However, I think that it contains one tra
EXTD=ck (Can't Let A Woman) that could be one of the finest songs ever
EXTD=recorded in the genre. I wish these guys had done a little more 
EXTD=up-tempo work, because both ends of the rhythm section are obviou
EXTD=sly top-notch players who never got much of a chance to showcase 
EXTD=their collective ability to drive the beat (at least with the mat
EXTD=erial the band is known for). The re-release of this song just fi
EXTD=lled a 20-year-old hole in my head. If it were me, I would have r
EXTD=e-arranged the order of the tracks and brought the more powerful 
EXTD=tunes (C.L.A.W., I Wanna Know) ahead. Burying these tracks on sid
