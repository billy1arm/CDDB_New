EXTD=\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Though Booker T. and the MG's had always been more of a singles act, they made a series of respectable long-players throughout the 1960s as well, culminating in the fine Melting Pot from 1971. Prior to recording that album, howev

EXTD=eleases like this are common now in this era of "tribute" albums, but in the late 60's something like this was uncommon. Booker T. Jones (organ, piano) and Donald "Duck" Dunn (bass) were big Beatles fans and cooked up the idea of covering the Beatles
