EXTD=Originally Released November 6, 2001\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: The title says
EXTD=it all -- that this third album is where it's all about Britney. Actuall
EXTD=y, the titles say it all: Britney is "Overprotected," she pleads "I'm Not
EXTD=a Girl, Not Yet a Woman," tries to let us all see "What It's Like to Be 
EXTD=Me." All three songs are pivotal moments on Britney Spears' third album, 
EXTD=the record where she strives to deepen her persona (not the same thing as
EXTD=her character, of course), making it more adult while still recognizably
EXTD=Britney. That much was evident from the selection of the first single, "
EXTD=I'm a Slave 4 U," a sultry Neptunes-produced salute to Prince that is so 
EXTD=far removed from the big, glitzy Max Martin productions that are her sign
EXTD=ature that at first it sounds awkward, even wrong. As it grows, it sounds
EXTD=like one of her best singles -- a skittering, spare funk number that is 
EXTD=a perfect next move for her teasing, unformed sexiness. Such a departure 
EXTD=seems to signal a full album of surprises like that, especially when team
EXTD=ed with the aforementioned title, but Britney isn't that bold -- after it
EXTD=opens with the Neptunes' retro-future funk, it delves right back into Ma
EXTD=rtin territory with "Overprotected." At first, that's a disappointment, b
EXTD=ut then the small, yet significant, changes become apparent. Rhythmically
EXTD=and melodically, the whole album is sharper, tougher than what came befo
EXTD=re. What used to be unabashedly frothy has some disco grit, underpinned b
EXTD=y Spears' spunky self-determination that helps sell hooks that are alread
EXTD=y catchier, by and large, than those that populated her previous two albu
EXTD=ms. While there's no denying that this reinvention and statement of dogge
EXTD=d individuality is no doubt a calculated move (and a brilliant, timely on
EXTD=e at that), there's no denying that it's effective, in large part because
EXTD=Spears is committed to making this record work. She's co-written more so
EXTD=ngs than ever before, and these are strong selections, whether it's the h
EXTD=ard-edged "Lonely," the sweet "That's Where You Take Me," or, especially,
EXTD=the neo-disco "Anticipating," one of the pure delights on this record. T
EXTD=hese are small steps forward -- really, the most overt steps forward are 
EXTD=the collaborations with the Neptunes on "Slave" and "Boys," which are the
EXTD=sexiest sounding cuts she ever did -- but most of the Martin productions
EXTD=sound fuller (particularly the Dido-written ballad "I'm Not a Girl"), an
EXTD=d Rodney Jerkins offers some welcome rhythmic invention on many of his co
EXTD=ntributions. This isn't a perfect record -- Martin stumbles on "Bombastic
EXTD=Love," Jerkins drops the ball on "I Love Rock N Roll" (this year's entry
EXTD=of the now obligatory cringe-inducing classic rock by Ms. Spears) -- but
EXTD=it does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her 
EXTD=voice, resulting in her best record yet (and rivaling Mandy Moore's epony
EXTD=mous album as the best teen-pop record yet released). It's enough of a re
EXTD=invention to suggest that Britney will know what to do when the teen-pop 
EXTD=phenomenon of 1999-2001 passes for good. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nAm
EXTD=azon.com Editorial Review\nWhere Britney Spears's first two albums hewed 
EXTD=to the early-'60s formula of one strong single plus a stack of filler--a 
EXTD=fair bit of which ended up on the radio anyway--her third justifies itsel
EXTD=f as a full-length listen. Led by the single "I'm a Slave 4 U," a Neptune
EXTD=s-helmed piece of electrofunk that promises she'll do anything you want a

EXTD=Spears's poses. Calculated frustration with the adult world? Calculated i
EXTD=ndependence? Sheer celebration? Check, check, and check: "Overprotected,"
EXTD="Let Me Be," and a cover of "I Love Rock and Roll" that brings to mind its
EXTD=bubblegum roots. Even without the joyous disco tribute of "Anticipating"
EXTD=and the not-icky ballad "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" providing symb
EXTD=olic respite from the rest of this machine-tooled music, Britney is one o

EXTD=Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nWell, the questio
EXTD=n is no longer whether she's a little girl or a woman--Britney Spears has
EXTD=obviously been the latter for some time. The question now is how long sh
EXTD=e'll be able to pretend at keeping us guessing, and how long we'll preten
EXTD=d not to know the answer. With BRITNEY she continues the dance of corrupt
EXTD=ed youth and innocence to the delight of both her female fans and dirty o
EXTD=ld and young men everywhere.\n\nWhile it's by no means the best song on t
EXTD=he album, the ballad "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" typifies her comme
EXTD=rcial appeal (interestingly, though she writes several songs here, this o
EXTD=ne was written for her). The songs that ring truest here are those penned
EXTD=by Spears herself, such as the Chic-influenced "Anticipating" and the R&
EXTD=B flavored "Lonely," which play down the innocent girl/tart predicament i
EXTD=n favor of presumably more realistic scenarios such as checking out her l
EXTD=ipstick in the former and relationship dilemmas in the latter. Elsewhere 
EXTD=she convincingly reduces Joan Jett's "I Love Rock 'N' Roll" to its bubble
EXTD=gum essentials, while her interpretation of main squeeze Justin Timberlak
EXTD=e's "What It's Like to Be Me" is arguably BRITNEY's finest moment.
