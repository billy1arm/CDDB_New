EXTD=ucer: Calvin Carter \n\nAlbum Notes\nDespite the title, JIMMY
EXTD=REED AT CARNEGIE HALL is not a live album, but a recreation 
EXTD=of a Jimmy Reed Carnegie Hall performance. The songs are not 
EXTD=the original recordings, but new versions recorded in 1961.\n
EXTD=\nThis is a hybrid Super Audio CD playable on both regular an
EXTD=d Super Audio CD players.\n\nPersonnel include: Jimmy Reed (v

EXTD=und Studios, New York, New York - Universal Studios, Chicago.
EXTD=\n\nInterestingly, JIMMY REED AT CARNEGIE HALL is not a conce
EXTD=rt album (technical and contractual difficulties prevented ta
EXTD=ping the actual event), but a studio recreation of the Carneg
EXTD=ie Hall set Reed and his band played several days before the 
EXTD=recording. Still, the album has the loose, spontaneous feel o
EXTD=f a live session, with Reed's simple, propulsive guitar playi
EXTD=ng, keening harmonica, and behind-the-beat singing in excepti
EXTD=onal working order. Abetted by guitarist "Lefty" Bates, drumm
EXTD=er Earl Phillips, and Reed's wife, "Mama" (whose sweet backin
EXTD=g vocals are an integral thread in the fabric of the music), 
EXTD=Reed turns in a wonderful performance.\n\nThe generous 23-son
EXTD=g set list, nearly all Reed originals, includes some of the p
EXTD=erformer's best tunes, including the chugging "Bright Lights,
EXTD=Big City," the insistent "Ain't That Lovin' You Baby," and t
EXTD=he slow-burning "You Don't Have to Go." The music is steeped 
EXTD=in the primal, hypnotic rhythms of the Delta tradition, with 
EXTD=a dash of savvy electric Chicago blues for balance, but the o
EXTD=verall vibe is warm and mellow. The set is characterized by R
EXTD=eed's trademark muted, swampy sound, which would go on to inf
EXTD=luence a generation of young bluesmen and rockers.\n\nAMAZON.

EXTD=lae]\nThis CD was originally issued as a double LP by Vee-Jay
EXTD=in the early '60s, and the title is decidedly odd considerin
EXTD=g that none of these songs are recorded live, or at Carnegie 
EXTD=Hall for that matter.\n\nThe first dozen tracks, which made u
EXTD=p the first of the two original vinyl LPs, are some nice midd
EXTD=le-period studio tracks, while the following dozen constitute
EXTD=s a "reissue" of sorts of the Vee-Jay label's "Best Of Jimmy

EXTD=nd is Mobile Fidelity impeccable, even on the mono masters, w
EXTD=hile stereo masters of such classics as "Baby What You Want M
EXTD=e To Do" and "Big Boss Man" sound almost revelatory. \n\nThe 
EXTD=various musicians include Reed's lead guitarist and childhood
EXTD=friend, the great Eddie Taylor, as well as Willie Dixon, Cur
EXTD=tis Mayfield and Phil Upchurch on bass, pianist Henry Gray, a
EXTD=nd guitarists Lee Baker and William "Lefty" Bates (who was in
EXTD=deed lefthanded and played his instrument upside down).\n\nIn
EXTD=addition to the eleven "Carnegie Hall" tracks, which are sup
EXTD=posed to recreate the track list from an actual concert at th
EXTD=at venue, the second half of the album features most (but not
EXTD=quite all) of Reed's classic blues shuffles, including crisp
EXTD=renditions of "You Got Me Dizzy", "You Don't Have To Go", "H
EXTD=onest I Do", "Ain't That Lovin' You Baby", and the wrongly ti
EXTD=tled "Baby What You Want Me To Do" (Jimmy Reed sings, and alw
EXTD=ays did sing, "baby why you wanna let go?").\n\nCritics hated
EXTD=Mathis James Reed's nasal, badly articulated vocal delivery,
EXTD=simple, two-string boogie patterns, and virtual inability on
EXTD=the harmonica, but the record buying public loved him, and h
EXTD=e frequently crossed over to the pop charts, an amazing feat 
EXTD=for a black blues singer in the 1950s. And Reed outsold every
EXTD=body from Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf to Little Walter and 
EXTD=Elmore James in the process.\n\nThe story of Jimmy Reed is a 
EXTD=tragic one, really. Illiterate, alcoholic and stricken with u
EXTD=ndiagnosed epilepsy, Reed was ill equipped to handle fame and
EXTD=fortune, and even though his faithful wife Mary (known to fa
EXTD=ns as "Mama" Reed) did everything she could to keep him funct
EXTD=ioning, he ended up slowly falling apart, finally dying at ag
EXTD=e 50 in 1976. His epilepsy had been diagnosed by then, and he
EXTD=had managed to quit the bottle and was receiving medical tre
EXTD=atment, but too late, and he died while trying to make a come
EXTD=back to the blues circuit.\n\nRhino's "Blues Masters: The Ver
EXTD=y Best Of Jimmy Reed" remains the best introduction to Reed's
EXTD=music, and this is not an ideal starting point for newcomers
EXTD=(even with most of the hits aboard), but if you have to have
EXTD=some classic Jimmy Reed in clean stereo, this is the place t
EXTD=o go.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nT'ain't live but it sure

EXTD=y reissued JIMMMY REED AT CARNEGIE HALL a Vee-Jay album(VJLP 
EXTD=1035) originally released in 1961. The first eleven songs are
EXTD=a recreation of performance Jimmy Reed gave at the "Blues at
EXTD=Carnegie" series(per the liner notes). The liner notes state
EXTD=that the reason the recording could not be done at Carnegie 
EXTD=Hall was due to "technical and contractural problems" so the 
EXTD=album ended up being recorded at New York City's Bell Sound S
EXTD=tudios. Some new tunes, at the time, were written for the Car
EXTD=negie performance such as "Blue Carnegie"(instrumental) and "
EXTD=Blue, blue, blue." It also includes such Reed classics such a
EXTD=s "Ah Shucks,Hush Your Mouth" and "Bright Lights Big City", t
EXTD=he first song on the album. The twelve remaining cuts is a be
EXTD=st of Jimmy Reed songsfest which are faithful rerecordings of
EXTD=his best known songs. "Take Out Some Insurance" is the only 
EXTD=song not written by Jimmy Reed. Although it has the same feel
EXTD=as a Jimmy Reed song the liner notes state that he hated it.
EXTD=Though his singing is sometimes slurred and out of tune, the
EXTD=sound of the blows on his harmonica and his guitar, sometime
EXTD=s accompanied by Eddie Taylor on bass guitar, make his blues 
EXTD=songs shine. This cd is a faithul reproduction of the lp incl
