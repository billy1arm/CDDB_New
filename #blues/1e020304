EXTD=Album Notes\nAs with the Beatles, part of the timelessness of th
EXTD=e Beach Boys' legacy is their dual identity as teen-pop act and g
EXTD=roundbreaking rock revolutionaries. Those whose affinity lies pri
EXTD=marily with the sugary surf melodies of the former will be riding
EXTD=a wave of ecstasy over this current compilation. Arriving at a t
EXTD=ime when the CD is being phased out but vinyl enthusiasm has been
EXTD=rejuvenated, SINGLES aims to add value to a compact-disc collect
EXTD=ion of Brian Wilson and Co.'s early work (the first 16 singles, to 
EXTD=be exact) by repackaging it in the original 45 sleeve art. The mu
EXTD=sic contained within ("I Get Around," "In My Room," "Little Deuce
EXTD=Coupe," "Surfin' U.S.A.") is most certainly in any fan's album r
EXTD=ack, CD shelf, or iPod, but Capitol's deluxe packaging (including
EXTD=a telescoping box and a 48-page photo book wrapped in faux sand)
EXTD=helps the listener to recreate this band's original era. Of cour

EXTD=seph M. Davis (Boston, MA USA]\n\nA lot of fun for the serious fa
EXTD=n of Brian Wilson and his band. This collection is worth the pric
EXTD=e to hear "She Knows Me Too Well" in stereo. Nicely packaged. If 
EXTD=you do not have California Girls and Please Let Me Wonder in ster
EXTD=eo these are included here as well. When I first saw this I thoug
EXTD=ht it was a gimmick that I didn't need until I realized that ther
EXTD=e were new stereo mixes involved. If only it could include a full
EXTD=stereo mix of I Get Around and for the next set Good Vibrations.
EXTD=But if you want to see how the band emerged singles-wise, this i
EXTD=s pretty cool. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThe Record Compa

EXTD=evant. They can't go on anymore putting out disposable (c)rap mus
EXTD=ic and expect to compete with the web or direct artist-to-audienc

EXTD=l, and audio delight. I don't know if the material has been remas
EXTD=tered specifically for this set or if is a re-release of the same
EXTD=masterings, but the sound quality is first-rate. Oh, and the mus
EXTD=ic? Yes, of course much of it has been released many times over, 
EXTD=as another reviewer noted, BUT HOW MANY BEACH BOYS NEWCOMERS ARE 
EXTD=EXPECTED TO BUY THIS SET ANYWAY? THIS IS A NICHE PRODUCT AIMED AT
EXTD=THE MORE-THAN-CASUAL FAN, although (as is true with BB music gen
EXTD=erally), casual fans will certainly enjoy the music. And there ar
EXTD=e some nuggets that are (at least for me), new finds. I.E. the li
EXTD=ve version of "409" on the first disc is not one that I've heard 
EXTD=before and crackles with energy (as do many live BB recordings fr
EXTD=om their first surge of popularity). The tactile and visual quali
EXTD=ties of this set are also wonderful -- the colors and varying tex
EXTD=tures of the box, as well as the reproduction 45 sleeves inside a
EXTD=nd the hardcover, "sand covered" book convey the optimism and hap

EXTD=t the stereo mix of she knows me so well is missing the guitar an

EXTD=ER REVIEW\nAs Close to Time Travel as We Are Now Capable . . ., J
EXTD=uly 18, 2008 \nBy  Edwin W. Skinner, Jr. "kindofblue" (Rocky Moun
EXTD=t, NC]\n\nThe merits of this set as laid out in strictly musical 
EXTD=terms already have been discussed. This is essential pop music an
EXTD=d would be an awesome addition to any collection. Beautiful packa
EXTD=ge, cool book and the sounds . . . well, let's just say that they
EXTD=are as fresh and innovative today as they were way back when. \n
EXTD=\nFor many of us, however, this set is much more than the tempora
EXTD=l sounds that emanate from the tiny, round aluminum circles conta
EXTD=ined herein. Within this box is the sound of a different America 
EXTD=and a different world - a sound from a time that saw everything as
EXTD=a possibility, and the future as some sure-to-be-terrific advent
EXTD=ure. The Beach Boys represent this time, this America, maybe bett
EXTD=er than any band in the history of popular music. With 40-odd yea
EXTD=rs of hindsight, however, we now see how much both America and th
EXTD=e Beach Boys have changed - and lost. Never a band to hide its (s
EXTD=ad) emotions, the poignancy this reverse view of time elicits is 
EXTD=staggering when you hear the music literally jump out of this box
EXTD=and into your ears. Packaged as updated 45 singles, the set furt
EXTD=her removes the listener to a more innocent time - a time before a
EXTD=lbums were 40-minute statements and taken as whole works of art. 
EXTD=Once upon a time the Song was the Thing, and the Beach Boys ruled
EXTD=that very magical universe. \n\nThe Beach Boys traveled many dif
EXTD=fcult roads during the years that followed their heydey as chroni
EXTD=cled in this collection. Brian went nuts. Dennis lost the fight o
EXTD=f his life, succumbing to the evils of excess. Carl lost to an ev
EXTD=en more insidious enemy, as cancer removed his angelic voice from
EXTD=this world and carried it to its most logical venue. Thankfully,
EXTD=then, we have this music to remind us just how talent, heart, de
EXTD=sire and true love of craft can translate into the finest canon o
EXTD=f popular music ever committed to tape. I say this with no apolog
EXTD=ies to the Beatles, the Stones - or anyone else. \n\nSo, the Beac
EXTD=h Boys (despite both Mike Love's and Al Jardine's most pathetic att
EXTD=empts) are no more. And neither is America - at least not the one
EXTD=we once knew, or the one we once dreamed of. Buy this box, load 
EXTD=your multi-disc tray and shut your eyes, however, and you are qui
EXTD=ckly transferred - if only temporarily - to a time when for both 
EXTD=the Beach Boys and America, anything was possible. \n\nPresumably
EXTD=and hopefully - there will be a second collection of Beach Boy
EXTD=s singles, none of which will be as celebrated as the songs conta
EXTD=ined in this set. Nevertheless, some great songs followed, and ma
EXTD=ny of them had very little to do with the Genius of Brian Wilson.
EXTD=When/if that set appears, we can then discuss its merits as the 
EXTD=soundtrack to the Downfall of America, the End of Innocence and t
EXTD=he withering-on-the-vine of America's most important and influent
EXTD=ial band. \n\n-- Comments Regarding the Above Post --\nInitial po

EXTD=that the baby boomers were and are, by their sheer numbers, an u

EXTD=\n\nAmerica has suffered greatly at the hands of these people. Th

EXTD=enough for them--it was never quick enough, and no one ever cared
EXTD=to examine the outcomes. And pills did things so much quicker an
EXTD=yway. Now with the market of baby boomers having shifted from LPs
EXTD=to male enhancement medication, we're once again getting dragged
EXTD=along. Ritalin for everyone!\n\nNever the ones to buckle down, p
EXTD=ull themselves up and get things done the old fashion way -- we'r
EXTD=e now "blessed" with rotting inner-cities and a generation of deg
EXTD=enerate politicians, promising to do everything for us -- but the
EXTD=only outcomes are really just higher taxes and impossible servic
EXTD=es that can never be rendered (and never intended to be) by a rul
EXTD=ing elite. So, it's the baby boomer kids, grand-kids and great-gr
EXTD=and kids who get stuck with the MASSIVE bill, while the degenerat
EXTD=e baby boomer "grand" parents -- having already left the table --
EXTD=are off dancing in tie-dyed t-shirts reliving woodstock. They we
EXTD=re supposed to leave the tip, but they forgot. Again.\n\nThe Beac
EXTD=h Boys, and the wonderful music contained herein, does capture th
EXTD=e innocence and promise of America before it was weighted down by
EXTD=the bilge of glossy-eyed Marxism and a radical anti-American cit
EXTD=izenry mascarading as doves, that STILL prefers to "shock us" at 
EXTD=every turn and--to this day--enjoys aiming their guns and spite a
EXTD=t its own people, while physically disarming them at that! But, i
EXTD=t's a much different world today than it was in 1962, that's for 
EXTD=sure.\n\nThe Beach Boys were along for the ride, too. Brian Wilso
EXTD=n probably just as much a victim of all this as anybody. A young,
EXTD=somewhat naive kid who had a lot of doubt and fears. As fame and
EXTD=fortune struck him, he dove into the "hip" counter-culture of th
EXTD=e mid-60s to find and be accepted. While the promise of enlighten
EXTD=ment yielded amazing results at first in his brilliant, musical m
EXTD=ind, it quickly unraveled, leaving a shattered shell of a man beh
EXTD=ind.\n\nBut you get none of that shattered soul here. This is Bri
EXTD=an and his brothers in sunny Southern California, living a dream.
EXTD=just as it was supposed to be. Girls, cars, school and girls. Y
EXTD=oung people naturally worrying about the things in their world, r
EXTD=ather than artificially projecting and inflating their concerns t

EXTD=neration has to up the ante, to get attention -- so now it's the 
EXTD=pending Armageddon and how the teens riding around in their hybri
EXTD=d mystery van, with their messy hair and earth-toned clothing, ar
EXTD=e going to save the planet for future generations. Wow.\n\nAs for
EXTD=the box set itself, I suspect you could have gotten a better pro
EXTD=duct if it was $40, three or four CDs, with scans of all the 45s 
EXTD=covers, front and back, full-size, in a nice full color book (per
EXTD=haps coffee-table sized, or a little smaller) accompanied with al
EXTD=l sorts great details (like when a 45 was released, when and were
EXTD=it was recorded, who was on those recordings, how it charted, al
EXTD=ternate covers if need be, and perhaps some great essays on the r
EXTD=ecordings, the music and the impact a particular track had on the

EXTD=REVIEW\nEnough already!, July 4, 2008 \nBy  John Benevento\n\nIt
EXTD='s absolutely disgraceful how Capitol treats its Beach Boys fans 
EXTD=regarding the release of their stereo mixes. Every few years we h
EXTD=ave to purchase yet another redundant collection of songs just to
EXTD=get a few new songs in stereo. Last year it was "The Warmth of t
EXTD=he Sun" (You're So Good To Me, All Summer Long), in 2001 it was "
EXTD=Hawthorne,CA" (Heroes and Villains, Dance Dance Dance), in 1998 i
EXTD=t was "Endless Harmony" (California Girls), in 1996 it was "Pet S
EXTD=ounds", and on and on. This latest collection is the most absurd 
EXTD=yet: $132.98 for two new stereo mixes (When I Grow Up To Be A Man
EXTD=and She Knows Me Too Well). At this rate the stereo Good Vibrati
EXTD=ons will cost $10,000 in 2025!! There's no reason (other than gre
EXTD=ed) why they couldn't have included "I Get Around" and "Help Me R
EXTD=honda" in stereo here as well. Bootlegs of these recordings exist
EXTD=with just one or two overdubs missing. There are many good homem
EXTD=ade stereo versions of Good Vibrations out there on the web. PLEA
EXTD=SE, Capitol, release these recordings while we are all still aliv
