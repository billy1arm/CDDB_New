EXTD=A Little Touch Of Schmilsson In The Night (Remastered and Expanded]\n\nOrigi
EXTD=nally Released 1973\nCD Edition Released March 1988\nRemastered and Expanded
EXTD=CD Edition Released May 23, 2006\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Nilsson was nearly
EXTD=a decade ahead of Linda Ronstadt and other nouveau crooners in hiring a c
EXTD=onductor/arranger of the pre-rock era (in this case Gordon Jenkins) and re
EXTD=cording an album of standards before a full orchestra. And he did it bette
EXTD=r than most, proving to be a marvelous interpreter of songs like "What'll 
EXTD=I Do?" and "Makin' Whoopee!" His version of "As Time Goes By" became a min
EXTD=or hit. -- William Ruhlmann\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nHarry Nilsson 
EXTD=wrote hits for other people (including the Monkees, Three Dog Night, and t
EXTD=he Modern Folk Quartet) yet had his biggest hits with covers of other folk
EXTD=s' material (Fred Neil's "Everybody's Talkin'," Badfinger's "Without You")
EXTD=So it makes a perverse kind of sense that his most enduringly popular al
EXTD=bum is a collection of pre-World War II standards. With Sinatra arranger G
EXTD=ordon Jenkins on hand for traffic control, Nilsson wraps his lungs around 
EXTD=such time-honored classics as "Makin' Whoopee!," "It Had to be You," and "
EXTD=As Time Goes By." Although Aerial Ballet and Nilsson Schmilsson are his fi
EXTD=nest outings, this album is extremely enjoyable on its own terms. --Dan Ep
EXTD=stein \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nbreathtaking, August 20, 2005\nRevie
EXTD=wer: Haute Connoisseur\nThis album is charming and heartbreaking. Nilsson'
EXTD=s fondness for popular ballads was clear on the album "Harry," which I lis
EXTD=tened to over and over when I was a teenager. I'm just happening on "A Lit
EXTD=tle Schmilsson in the Night" now, and I'm happy to see that Nilsson's nost
EXTD=algic side was so fully realized before he died. As I listen to the album 
EXTD=today, I can't believe that it's ironic or condescending in the least. He'
EXTD=s so in the love with the music...\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nJust Per
EXTD=fect, July 3, 2002\nReviewer: Kenneth French (Montclair, NJ]\nThis is an a
EXTD=bsolutely perfect record. Harry's beautiful voice matched with stellar arr
EXTD=angements by Gordon Jenkins and the best songs imaginable. Probably the be
EXTD=st "As Time Goes By" there will ever be. "Touch of Schmilsson" has even mo
EXTD=re meaning for me because I met Harry and had him sign it for me about 20 
EXTD=years ago. He regaled me with stories of himself and Keith Moon carrying o
EXTD=n in the 70s (I was wearing a Who shirt, which sparked his memory), then h
EXTD=e mistakenly inscribed the record to Keith instead of Ken. An honest mista
EXTD=ke and I loved him all the more for it. A classy album from a very classy 
EXTD=guy. I miss him.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSimply brilliant, January 
EXTD=23, 2001\nReviewer: David Pearlman "sound fanatic" (Arlington, MA United S
EXTD=tates]\nWhen this album was released in the early '70s--a collection of so
EXTD=ngs that were already decades old, carefully arranged by Sinatra's best ba
EXTD=llad arranger Gorden Jenkins--it wasn't clear if this was intended as a lo
EXTD=ving tribute or an ironic statement. Coming from then poster boy for hip m
EXTD=usic lovers and years before this type of record would be popularized by p
EXTD=eople like Linda Ronstadt, and in light of Nilsson's well-known sense of h
EXTD=umor, it just seemed this couldn't be serious.\nOr could it? \n\nWell, the
EXTD=truth is, it doesn't matter. Because context becomes irrelevant over time
EXTD=, and what's left is the music. And, what beautiful music it is. Tremendou
EXTD=sly well-chosen standards from throughout the first half of the 20th centu
EXTD=ry, tremendously well orchestrated by a master, and sung with passion AND 
EXTD=precision by a man of great vocal talent. Who cares what anyone was thinki
EXTD=ng? All you ever need to know is on the record.\n\nTime has only been kind
EXTD=to this album, and to these ears it has dated not a whit in the more than
EXTD=quarter century since it was released. Perhaps because it was never of it
EXTD=s time in the first place. Lush romantic music from a happier, simpler tim
EXTD=e--something we all need.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nAn incomplete mas
EXTD=terpiece, July 31, 2000\nReviewer: Claster (Los Angeles, CA USA]\nThis alb
EXTD=um, featuring brilliant performances by both singer Harry Nilsson and arra
EXTD=nger Gordon Jenkins, was (for some reason) hacked up and only about 65% of
EXTD=it was released. As the entire album was conceived as a whole, with links
EXTD=bridging the songs, this was a real shame.\nHowever, the full album has r
EXTD=ecently been restored and released under the title "As Time Goes By: The C
EXTD=omplete Schmilsson in the Night," and so you should absolutely avoid "A Li
EXTD=ttle Touch" and make sure to get "As Time Goes By." You won't be sorry.\n

EXTD=rry Nilsson (vocals).\n\nTime will tell whether Harry Nilsson is remembere
EXTD=d most fondly for his songwriting or his singing. Throughout his career, h
EXTD=e covered outside material (two of his biggest hits were Fred Neil's "Ever
EXTD=ybody's Talkin'" and Badfinger's "Without You"), and even devoted an entir
EXTD=e album to songs by Randy Newman (NILSSON SINGS NEWMAN). After the rollick
EXTD=ing party of NILSSON SCHMILSSON and SON OF SCHMILSSON, he delivered this a
EXTD=lbum. It's a set of pre-rock-era, crooner-styled ballads, lushly arranged 
EXTD=and conducted by Gordon Jenkins (who achieved his greatest fame with Frank
EXTD=Sinatra). Nilsson handles the songs with grace and aplomb. He's never clo
EXTD=ying or maudlin, and demonstrates a deep understanding of material that cl
EXTD=early influenced much of his early development as an artist. He's a confid
EXTD=ent interpreter, making standards like "Makin' Whoopee!" and "As Time Goes
EXTD=By" his own. YEAR: 1973
