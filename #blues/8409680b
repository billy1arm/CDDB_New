EXTD="Take a Look" Aretha Franklin has simply been one of the greatest
EXTD=singers of the modern generation, and whether bringing her power
EXTD=ful, passionate voice to bear on gospel standards, songs from the
EXTD=Great American Songbook, jazz standards, pop ditties, or deep So
EXTD=uthern soul and R&B, she has always had the presence -- much like
EXTD=Ray Charles -- to make anything she touches unmistakably hers. F
EXTD=ranklin began her career in gospel when she was still a teenager,
EXTD=and her amazing vocal talents, coupled with her fine piano playi
EXTD=ng, marked her as a once-in-a-lifetime kind of artist, qualities 
EXTD=very apparent to legendary talent scout John Hammond, who signed 
EXTD=her to Columbia Records. The problem Hammond and Columbia immedia
EXTD=tely ran into, though, was how to best present that spirited voic
EXTD=e to the secular pop world. Between 1960 and 1969 (her first rele
EXTD=ase for the label was actually in 1961), Columbia tried Franklin 
EXTD=in a variety of styles and settings, and if none of them exactly 
EXTD=caught fire the way her legendary later sides for Atlantic Record
EXTD=s would, they still allowed Franklin to explore a lot of avenues,
EXTD=and she was too good a singer not to be at least memorable in al
EXTD=l of them. This wonderful box set includes CDs of Franklin's seve
EXTD=n full-length albums for the label, two CDs of her work with prod
EXTD=ucers Bobby Scott (in 1963) and Clyde Otis (in 1964), a CD of sin
EXTD=gles produced by Bob Johnston, plus rarities that were sweetened 
EXTD=and released after Franklin left Columbia for Atlantic and a DVD 
EXTD=featuring Franklin performing several songs at the piano on The S
EXTD=teve Allen Show in 1964. It's a tremendous set, and it portrays a
EXTD=n artist working her own way toward how to best present herself t
EXTD=o the world. We all know she got there.  -- Steve Leggett\n\nAMG 
EXTD=EXPERT REVIEW: ("Unforgettable: A Tribute To Dinah Washington")  
EXTD=N/A\n\nAmazon.com essential recording\nThe myth that Columbia Rec
EXTD=ords producers kept Aretha from finding her soul on disc has larg
EXTD=ely been discredited, and albums such as the 1964 Unforgettable a

EXTD=thm section, Franklin delivers highly personalized renditions of 
EXTD=10 songs associated with the great Dinah Washington, who'd passed

EXTD=ntion Washington's effortless sense of swing. Shortly before she 
EXTD=died, Washington took appreciate notice of her acolyte as well. S
EXTD=o Aretha's tribute to Washington is as logical as it is satisfyin
EXTD=g. Recorded when Aretha was just 21, UNFORGETTABLE is somewhat of
EXTD=a departure from her more R&B-oriented early work. However, the 
EXTD=string arrangements of Johnny Mersey adn the jazzy bass work of G
EXTD=eorge Duvivier mesh perfectly with Franklin's high-flying vocal f
EXTD=ireworks. From the slow, subtle caress of "What a Difference a Da
EXTD=y Made" to the organ-led blues of "Nobody Knows the Way I Feel Th
