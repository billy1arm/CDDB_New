EXTD=st\ngrandiloquent album EVER. \n\nTime and time again I've tried 
EXTD=to empathize with those who dislike\nthis album, thinking that pe
EXTD=rhaps their criticisms have some merit.\nStill, I can't get over 
EXTD=the fact that this is truly excellent work. I\nthink the music is
EXTD=simply sublime, many of the most wonderful passages\nthat Yes ev

EXTD=akes countless listens to fully appreciate. Even 25 years after i
EXTD=ts\nrelease, I'm still finding new elements to this richly absorb
EXTD=ing work.\n\nIt's all anchored by that awesome rhythm section of 
EXTD=Alan White's drums\nand Chris Squire's mammoth bass guitar, while
EXTD=Wakeman's lush\nsynthesizers add ambiance and depth, and Steve H
EXTD=owe's guitar artistry\nis sophisticated and engaging. Jon Anderso
EXTD=n's trippy lyrics and\nsoulful, radiant singing are topnotch. Alt
EXTD=hough the lyrics are mostly\nconfusing, I believe their meanings 
EXTD=are meant to be vague. They rely\non surreal and romantic imagery
EXTD=to generate feeling in the listener in\nmusical context. It does
EXTD=n't really matter because the lyrics attain an\nemotional connect
EXTD=ion regardless of what they are actually about. I've\nalways beli
EXTD=eved that Yes' individual elements are impressive, but less\nimpo

EXTD=nstruments. Lots of\nmemorable melodies here, and the song gets p
EXTD=retty intense at times\n(like the "Relayer" passages).\n\n"The An
EXTD=cient" is the most difficult song to appreciate. Because most\nof
EXTD=the vocals are relegated to the ending of this 18-minute beast, 
EXTD=its\nheavy focus on abstruse instrumentation bores many people. I
EXTD=can't help\nbut be captivated, however. I'm a huge fan of music t

EXTD=ge opens this one, and just when you think\nthe track is starting
EXTD=to meander, it gets back on track. This one\nnever gets too pret
