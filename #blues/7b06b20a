EXTD=opular within jazz and traditional pop audiences, yet Frank Sinat
EXTD=ra hadn't attempted any Brazil-influenced material. Sinatra decid
EXTD=ed to record a full-fledged bossa nova album with the genre's lea
EXTD=ding composer, Antonio Carlos Jobim. Arranged by Claus Ogerman an
EXTD=d featuring Jobim on guitar and backing vocals, Francis Albert Si
EXTD=natra and Antonio Carlos Jobim concentrated on Jobim's originals, a
EXTD=dding three American classics -- "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," "C
EXTD=hange Partners," and "I Concentrate on You" -- that were rearrang
EXTD=ed to suit bossa nova conventions. The result was a subdued, quie
EXTD=t album that used the Latin rhythms as a foundation, not as a foc
EXTD=al point. Supported by a relaxed, sympathetic arrangement of mute
EXTD=d brass, simmering percussion, soft strings, and Jobim's lilting 
EXTD=guitar, Sinatra turns in an especially noteworthy performance - he
EXTD=has never sounded so subtle, underplaying every line he delivers
EXTD=and showcasing vocal techniques that he never had displayed befo
EXTD=re. Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim doesn't reveal 
EXTD=its pleasures immediately - the album is too textured and understa
EXTD=ted to be fully appreciated within one listen. After a few plays,
EXTD=the album begins to slowly work its way underneath a listener's 
EXTD=skin, and it emerges as one of his most rewarding albums of the '
EXTD=60s.   -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com essential recor
EXTD=ding\nMultitalented Brazilian musician Jobim's talent was reveale
EXTD=d to a larger world in 1959 by his and Luis Bonfa's score for the
EXTD=film Orfeu Negro (Black Orpheus) in 1959. Songs such as "A Felic
EXTD=idade" and "Desafinado" generated the bossa nova movement of the 
EXTD=early '60s that inspired the likes of Stan Getz, Charlie Byrd, an
EXTD=d Miles Davis. This 1967 album features Jobim sharing vocals with
EXTD=Sinatra on "The Girl from Ipanema" and "How Insensitive." Three 
EXTD=standards--"Change Partners" by Irving Berlin - "I Concentrate on 
EXTD=You" by Cole Porter - and Robert Wright, George Forrest, and Alexa

EXTD=it, March 24, 2006 \nBy  Leonard Fleisig "Len" (Here, there and e
EXTD=verywhere]\n\nI purchased this album because the author (and Sina
EXTD=tra aficionado) Pete Hamill claimed in his book "Why Sinatra Matt
EXTD=ers" that it was one of Sinatra's best. Nevertheless I was skepti
EXTD=cal because quite often a record producer or performer will get t
EXTD=he idea that creating a 'super group' or pairing two very talente
EXTD=d musicians will create a record that is even greater than the su
EXTD=m of its parts. That usually doesn't happen. The usual result is 
EXTD=one in which each 'diva' takes a turn showcasing his or her talen
EXTD=ts. "Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim" is a rare and
EXTD=very pleasant exception. Although not a 50-50 blend, this album 
EXTD=really showcases Sinatra performing the great Jobim's music, the 
EXTD=result is virtually flawless. \n\nSinatra and Jobim was released in
EXTD=the U.S. in 1967 during the height of Brasil's bossa nova invasi
EXTD=on. Performers such as Jobim, Joao Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto, 
EXTD=enjoyed tremendous influence on U.S. pop music and jazz. Stan Get
EXTD=z, Charlie Byrd, Ella Fitzgerald and others all absorbed or colla
EXTD=borated in the bossa nova boom. This album and the later "Sinatra
EXTD=and Company" mark Sinatra's footprint in the bossa nova genre. \n
EXTD=\nThe CD opens with an excellent cover of The Girl from Ipanema w
EXTD=ith Sinatra taking verses in English and Jobim in Portuguese. As 
EXTD=others have noted, Sinatra's voice is quiet to the point of whisp
EXTD=ering. Those used to swing era Sinatra and his other full throttl
EXTD=e vocals may find is quiet, spare renditions different to say the
EXTD=least. It happens to work in the context of this and other track
EXTD=s such as Dindi, Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars and Meditation. Sina
EXTD=tra always had a great feel for interpreting a song and I think h
EXTD=is approach to Jobim's songs is dead solid perfect. Similarly, th
EXTD=e three non-Jobim songs arranged by the very talented Claus Ogerm
EXTD=an, "Change Partners", "I Concentrate on You", and "Baubles, Bang
EXTD=les and Beads", fit in nicely with Jobim's in terms of the mood a
EXTD=nd the music. \n\nAll in all this is an excellent CD and is one t
EXTD=hat I often turn to when I want music to whisper to me instead of
EXTD=shout. Highly recommended. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDou

EXTD=c (Tarpon Springs, Florida USA]\n\nThough this album clocks in at
EXTD=a measley 28:34, it may well be Sinatra's finest work of the 196
EXTD=0s, and song for song it is up to the quality of anything he ever
EXTD=did--including even his glorious prime period of the 1950s. Each
EXTD=song is a gem--a diamond on black velvet. Antonio Carlos Jobim, 
EXTD=who plays guitar and occasionally sings backup during the recordi
EXTD=ng sessions, was one of the greatest song writers of the past cen
EXTD=tury, easily in the class of Gershwin, Cole Porter, or Duke Ellin
EXTD=gton. Seven of his best songs grace this album, each lovingly fra
EXTD=med by atmospheric, beautiful Claus Ogerman arrangements. The rea
EXTD=l surprise comes when one hears the three non-Jobim songs: "Chang
EXTD=e Partners", "I Concentrate on You", and "Baubles, Bangles, and B
EXTD=eads." The bossa arrangements of these songs are just as stunning
EXTD=as the rest, and for my tastes (after more than two hundred list
EXTD=ens), possibly even more impressive than the others. This music s
EXTD=tands up to redundant play and never fails to impress and please.
EXTD=I only wish that Reprise would take the side from the deleted 19
EXTD=69 album (Sinatra and Company) that was recorded with Jobim and O
EXTD=german, and package it with this album to make it a 45 or 50 minu

EXTD=tion, July 30, 2005 \nBy  D. D. Fulton (Los Angeles, CA. USA]\n\n
EXTD=One reviewer of the Getz/Gilberto album says that album would be 
EXTD=one he'd take into the afterlife. For me, it is this collaboratio
EXTD=n between two of my favorite jazz artists of the 20th century - S
EXTD=inatra and Jobim. First there is the music itself... delicate, li
EXTD=ght as breeze across naked skin. There are a lot of layers here -
EXTD=guitar, percussion, delicate trumpet -all of which are arranged 
EXTD=superbly by Claus Ogerman to underscore rather than compete with 
EXTD=each other. It is cool jazz laid atop of shaved ice. \n\nThen, of
EXTD=course, there is Sinatra. A very different sort of Frank came to
EXTD=these sessions. Gone is the hyperbole and beloved histrionics th
EXTD=at made his "ring-a-ding" and crooner personas so endearing. But 
EXTD=Sinatra changes personas as surely as Ziggy became the Thin White
EXTD=Duke. He becomes "Francis." A liliting, delicate, but still supr
EXTD=emely masculine singer, navigating through Jobim's textures on a 
EXTD=glider rather than a Lear jet. This instinct for the material, so
EXTD=quiet, yet so clear, causes the listener to feel Sinatra effortl
EXTD=essly inhabit the material, not like a tourist, but as a native. 
EXTD=The visual on "Cocorvado"is one of a mature Frank under a tree, s
EXTD=hirtless, tan, in cargo-pants, strumming his ramshackle guitar wh
EXTD=ile local girls swoon nearby. \n\nI adore all of Sinatra's concep
EXTD=t albums, but this gem holds special place in my heart for it man
EXTD=ages to connect the cultures without being overly dear or condesc
EXTD=ending. There is the feeling of summer romance here. The feeling 
EXTD=of two men finding the right notes again and again. \n\n\nAMAZON.

EXTD=Ephraim Khalife (Southeastern USA]\n\nIt took me quite a while to
EXTD=get into this album. "The Girl from Ipanema" instantly struck me
EXTD=as one of the best songs I've ever heard, but the rest of the al
EXTD=bum took me a while to settle into. Being of a younger generation
EXTD=exposed to new wave, punk, heavy metal, etc...I think it takes a
EXTD=while to get used to the soft sounds of Sinatra. I'm sooooooo gl

EXTD=rl From Ipanema" instantly transports me to Brazil. You can tell 
EXTD=this song was written by someone surrounded by Brazilian beauty. 
EXTD=This collaboration was such a brilliant idea, Jobims' songs and a
EXTD=mazing guitar work with Sinatra's smooth vocals. "Dindi" is the s
EXTD=econd best tune on the record. There's something so beautiful abo
EXTD=ut a truly tender love ballad...this is the real thing, not that 
EXTD=watered down garbage "love pop" of today, these guys knew what th
EXTD=ey were doing. \n\nThe disc also includes the Burl Ives' classic 
EXTD="Change Partners" which is an innocently mischevious song (I know
EXTD=its a paradox.) Basically this record is a great collection of l
EXTD=aid back samba songs by Jobim (with a one or two exceptions) tran
EXTD=slated into English and sung by Sinatra. I think translating thes
EXTD=e tunes was a great idea, because they are instantly more accessi
EXTD=ble.\n\nI've always disliked "love songs" and "romantic music," b

EXTD=sun-drenched Brazilian jazz lyrics blended with equal parts of S
EXTD=inatra, Jobim, and Claus Ogerman equal one of the most interestin
EXTD=g and eclectic concept albums of the Sinatra canon. Antonio Carlo
EXTD=s Jobim has been referred to as the George Gershwin of Brazil. Hi
EXTD=s low-key romantic rhythms powered the 60's Bossa Nova craze and 
EXTD=impressed Sinatra sufficiently to commit to a truly experimental 
EXTD=album. There are only ten tracks, and only seven of them were wri
EXTD=tten by Jobim. The album is barely twenty-eight minutes in length
EXTD=, and it was arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman. His delicat
EXTD=e, string-drenched orchestrations provide the perfect canvas for 
EXTD=The Voice and Jobim to showcase their diametrically opposite but 
EXTD=complementary musical talents. Jobim's romantic guitar and unobtr
EXTD=usive vocals mesh effortlessly with the most deliberately restrai
EXTD=ned recording of Sinatra's entire career. This was a project that
EXTD=greatly interested Sinatra, and it shows in the terrific and suc
EXTD=cessful effort he made not to overpower the melody or the lyrics 
EXTD=or the emotional tone and feeling of the music. The result is one
EXTD=of the great, classic concept albums of the 20th century. It wor
EXTD=ks because Sinatra was a musical genius who could succeed in almo
EXTD=st any musical universe. In lesser hands this album would be noth
EXTD=ing more than mindless elevator music, but Sinatra and Jobim beco
EXTD=me musical soul-mates and create an album of great subtlety and d
EXTD=epth. The best track on the album is "Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars
EXTD=," but everything else is equally outstanding. Be sure to buy the
EXTD=1971 follow-up, "Sinatra and Friends." It's also outstanding, bu
EXTD=t not as well-known or revered as this 1967 effort. "Francis Albe

EXTD=y who listens to this could possibly doubt Sinatra's stature as o
EXTD=ne of the greatest vocalists of the twentieth century. This entir

EXTD=une" (Annapolis, MD USA]\n\nSuperlative recordings happen not pur
EXTD=ely by design, and not purely by inspiration or chance, but by a 
EXTD=rare combination of all these factors. Of course, it helps to hav
EXTD=e incomparable talent in the mix. When all this is in place, you 
EXTD=just might, once in a while, get results that rise to the level o
EXTD=f this record.\n\nSinatra the crooner met perhaps his greatest ch
EXTD=allenge in the making of this album. As the liner notes to the or
EXTD=iginal vinyl recording point out, this session was like a competi
EXTD=tion to see who could play/sing the softest. The challenge was re
EXTD=ndered manageable by two factors.\n\nFirstly, we are talking abou
EXTD=t the songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim, surely the greatest writer o
EXTD=f Brazilian popular music. His songs are so beautiful, so intimat
EXTD=e, that the voice just naturally tends towards mellowness. The th
EXTD=emes are timeless and the lyrics, even in English, sensual and im
EXTD=bued with the unique mixture of joy and sadness that only Brazili
EXTD=an music fully expresses. That is why we love it, and nobody writ
EXTD=es it like "Tom" Jobim.\n\nSecondly, we have the rich, moving arr
EXTD=angements of the great Claus Ogerman. Not exactly a household wor
EXTD=d, Ogerman has penned the most memorable arrangements for Brazili
EXTD=an music since the early 60's, including the quintessential Jobim
EXTD=recordings of that decade. When it comes to this kind of sound, 
EXTD=nobody else even comes close. Ogerman knows these songs so well h
EXTD=e could arrange for them in a coma. Fortunately, he was fully luc
EXTD=id for this session, and the results are, simply, magnificent.\n\n
EXTD=So, we have the best singer ever, singing the best Brazilian song
EXTD=s ever written, accompanied on guitar by the author himself, with
EXTD=a full orchestra conducted by the best arranger ever to inhabit 
EXTD=the genre. The recording quality is superb as well. Even the line
EXTD=r notes, reproduced for the CD release, are nicely written with m
EXTD=oments of real humor. What more could one ask for?\n\nI have thre
EXTD=e copies, in case I lose two. If I had to spend the rest of my li
EXTD=fe on a desert isle with only one record, this would be it. I nev
EXTD=er tire of it, it never lets me down, and it will, I believe, sta
EXTD=nd as one of the great recordings of the century. If you don't ow

EXTD=but he imbues the songs with real feeling: his vocals on this rel

EXTD=love, romance, all the typical topics, but his performance is ju
EXTD=st so deep that I can only describe it as being philosophical. Fr

EXTD=orcovado, October 7, 2008 \nBy  Eric J. Anderson (Ankeny, Iowa]\n
EXTD=\nSometimes the stars align for a recording date, and something i
EXTD=nexplicably perfect and right and synchronous occurs. On the evid
EXTD=ence, that appears to have happened when Frank Sinatra, Antonio C
EXTD=arlos Jobim, Claus Ogerman, and a small orchestra assembled one d
EXTD=ay in a recording studio to play the songs of Jobim and a few oth
EXTD=er American classic tunes given a similar "bossa nova with string
EXTD=s" re-working. \n\nFor virtually the entire album, the focus is o
EXTD=n softness and controlled intensity, which is very difficult for 
EXTD=musicians, especially vocalists and woodwinds. On this stereo rem
EXTD=ix of the four-track original tape you hear orchestra left, orche
EXTD=stra right (with drum kit). In the middle, slightly to the right,
EXTD=is Frank himself. In the middle, slightly to the left, we hear t
EXTD=he constant syncopation of Jobim's nylon-string guitar, and his P
EXTD=ortuguese and Portuguese-accented English vocal contributions, wh
EXTD=ich contribute to the atmosphere, but do not markedly steer the s
EXTD=potlight from Sinatra. The instrumental and vocal tone is rich, l
EXTD=iquid, with a sense of acoustic space around the instruments. The
EXTD=sound of the strings is sweet, and everything has warm, gorgeous
EXTD=tonal qualities. \n\nAlso, this is essentially a live-in-the-stu
EXTD=dio recording. All the musicians were playing and being recorded 
EXTD=at the same time. Sinatra was able to truly feed off what his pla
EXTD=yers were doing in the moment. I believe this adds to the holisti
EXTD=c "rightness" of the performance. (The vocals on Corcovado have a
EXTD=different sonic character. This vocal just might have been an ov
EXTD=erdub recorded after the backing tracks, but I cannot say with ce
EXTD=rtainty.) \n\nThe songs should be known by all lovers of the clas
EXTD=sic songbook and classic bossa nova. Ogerman's arrangements compl
EXTD=ement Frank's restrained gliding vocal lines, never calling undue
EXTD=attention to themselves. This is not an album that will make you
EXTD=want to twitch about or jump up and dance (unless it's a slow da
EXTD=nce). This album is as distinctly American as Sinatra himself, at
EXTD=the same time incorporating the classic elements of bossa nova, 
EXTD=even down to the "happy sadness" of the mood. In other words, the
EXTD=sadness of a song is presented with the lightest touch. That gir
EXTD=l from Ipanema, "she just doesn't see, she doesn't see me." But i
EXTD=t's a line that makes you smile, thinking that the guy will just 
EXTD=sigh and shrug it off, not veer into obsession or depression. \n\n
EXTD=Picture yourself on a beach, under the shade of a palm. You have 
EXTD=a cool drink. Temperature is a perfect 75. The gentlest of breeze
EXTD=s kiss the shore. And this short Sinatra-Jobim album is the sound
EXTD=track best fitting that scene. At 28 minutes, it is too short. Bu
