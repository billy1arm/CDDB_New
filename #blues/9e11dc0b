EXTD=EXPERT REVIEW:  Released in 2001, Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985 wa
EXTD=s a historically significant Stevie Ray Vaughan recording in pure
EXTD=ly audio form, but the 2004 DVD release ups the ante by providing
EXTD=video footage of both sets. The 1982 show is essentially the sho
EXTD=w that got his career started. He met both Jackson Browne and Dav
EXTD=id Bowie after his set, and they were so impressed that Browne vo
EXTD=lunteered use of his studio (for free!) for Stevie to record what
EXTD=would become his debut album, and Bowie recruited him as lead gu
EXTD=itarist for the Let's Dance album and tour (alas, the tour was no
EXTD=t to be). However, not everyone was so impressed. In fact, there 
EXTD=are choruses of boos that follow nearly every tune. Vaughan was b
EXTD=asically a nobody at the time, playing very electric blues at the
EXTD=end of a mostly acoustic program. But he had done enough bar gig
EXTD=s to completely rise above it, and he plays with the passion and 
EXTD=hunger of a young musician getting his big chance. He's not reall
EXTD=y an engaging frontman at this point in his career, but man, can 
EXTD=he play that guitar. And he simply never lets up. Even at this st
EXTD=age, his tone and style are pretty close to fully formed, and it'
EXTD=s easy to see how he could become the guitar hero he ended up bei
EXTD=ng. \n\nThe 1985 show is quite a contrast. Vaughan had become a s
EXTD=tar, and it shows in so many ways. He had developed more of a sta
EXTD=ge persona, with showier moves and infinitely more presence as a 
EXTD=frontman. He's also dressed to the hilt, looking like some sort o
EXTD=f '80s cowboy-pimp with a ridiculous hat, multiple scarfs, and gi
EXTD=gantic earring. Heck, even Whipper Layton is sporting fancier '80
EXTD=s pants and a big earring, and Tommy Shannon's hat is more extrav
EXTD=agant than the 1982 show as well. Double Trouble also now include
EXTD=d Reese Wynans on keyboards, which, along with Vaughan's addition
EXTD=of a wah-wah pedal, really expanded the sound. Vaughan has many 
EXTD=fiery moments on this set as well, but he also loses focus during
EXTD=several solos, and seems more than content to share or even hand
EXTD=over the spotlight to fellow Texas guitar legend Johnny Copeland
EXTD=Vaughan seems a bit worn out, and it wouldn't be long before he
EXTD=got sober. Even so, there are clear moments of brilliance and th
EXTD=is time the audience is fully behind him. Live at Montreux 1982 &
EXTD=1985 is a vital document for fans, showing the raw ingredients t
EXTD=hat would make him a star, then comparing it to what happened onc
EXTD=e he got there. The video is great, with multiple angles througho
EXTD=ut (except for the encore of the 1985 set) and there are many exc
EXTD=ellent close-ups of his playing. It's a great look at the rise of
EXTD=one of rock's most revered guitar players.  -- Sean Westergaard\n
EXTD=\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review (2CD+2DVD Edition]\nIt's not the 
EXTD=familiar, fiery playing of Stevie Ray Vaughan that tips listeners
EXTD=off that this set's first disc has captured an extraordinary mom
EXTD=ent in modern blues history - it's the jarring, rising chorus of b
EXTD=oos that accompanies it. As with previous musicians as disparate 
EXTD=as Dylan and Stravinsky, Vaughan's willful tweaking of staid genr
EXTD=e conventions initially infuriated purists. Though few could have
EXTD=imagined it at the time, Vaughan and company's July 17, 1982, sh
EXTD=ow at the Montreux Jazz Festival (included here in its entirety) 
EXTD=ignited not only a brilliant career, but a widespread revival of 
EXTD=the blues as well.\n\nDavid Bowie was there that night, but he wa
EXTD=s not booing. He secured the Texas guitarist's services for his s
EXTD=mash Let's Dance album on the spot, nearly a year before Vaughan 
EXTD=would make his major-label debut.\n\nStraight from the Austin clu
EXTD=b scene, the band displays their nervous energy in a set that con
EXTD=tains several previously unreleased/rare gems from SRV's early re
EXTD=pertoire, including the Hound Dog Taylor romp "Give Me Back My Wi
EXTD=g." By the time of this set's second disc, recorded just three ye
EXTD=ars later, SRV was a worldwide star, the boos had turned to rousi
EXTD=ng cheers, and Vaughan's nervousness was replaced by an incendiar
EXTD=y swagger he seemed all too happy to push into the crowd's faces.
EXTD=With the band (drummer Chris Layton, bassist Tommy Shannon) now 
EXTD=augmented by Reese Wynans on organ and guest guitarist Johnny Cop
EXTD=eland sitting in on "Tin Pan Alley," the triumphant show (11 of t
EXTD=he 15 songs are included here) centered on the cream of SRV's fir
EXTD=st three studio albums. While some of these tracks have found the
EXTD=ir way onto other releases (Live Alive, Blues at Sunrise), the sh
EXTD=ow's "Scuttle Buttin'," "Voodoo Chile," "Gone Home," and "Couldn'
EXTD=t Stand the Weather" are released here for the first time. The se
EXTD=t's comprehensive liner notes contain new commentary from the ban
EXTD=d's Shannon and Layton, David Bowie, early confidant Darryl Pitt,
EXTD=and many quotes from the guitar legend himself. All history less
EXTD=ons should be this riveting. --Jerry McCulley\n\n\nAmazon.com Edi

EXTD=est in Stevie Ray Vaughan's peerless mastery of urban blues guita
EXTD=r, you must own Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985. Spaced almost exact
EXTD=ly three years apart, these concerts (60 and 93 minutes, respecti

EXTD=e Trouble (drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon) laying
EXTD=the solid foundation upon which SRV built a Fender-driven sound 
EXTD=as fierce as it was perfectly refined. The '82 show was truly "su
EXTD=ccess in disguise," because despite booing from a festival audien
EXTD=ce lulled by a day of acoustic blues, and the stunned dejection t
EXTD=hat SRV felt after persevering through a uncompromising set, this
EXTD=was the turning point in SRV's career, leading to post-show enco
EXTD=unters with Jackson Browne and David Bowie, who proved instrument
EXTD=al in bringing Stevie's music to an appreciative global audience.
EXTD=\n\nWhen Stevie, Chris, and Tommy returned to Switzerland three y
EXTD=ears later, with organist Reese Wynans adding rich new dimension 
EXTD=to the Double Trouble sound, the Montreux crowd was primed for a 
EXTD=rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubilant response is a joyous thing t
EXTD=o witness. One of SRV's favorite bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appea
EXTD=rs for a three-song triumph in a set that's uniformly superior an
EXTD=d ecstatically energized. Basic three-camera coverage is all you 
EXTD=need, although guitar students--for whom this DVD is a godsend--w
EXTD=ill surely wish for more emphasis on SRV's picking and fretwork. 
EXTD=Recording quality is superb in the Montreux tradition, with 5.1-c
EXTD=hannel remixes that surpass the original masters. A splendid 23-m
EXTD=inute documentary features retrospective interviews with Layton, 
EXTD=Shannon, Browne, and John Mayer, and the accompanying booklet inc
EXTD=ludes a heartfelt reminiscence from Bowie. Stevie Ray may be gone
EXTD=, but Live at Montreux ensures that his gold-standard legacy will
EXTD=endure. --Jeff Shannon
