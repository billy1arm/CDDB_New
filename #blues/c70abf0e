EXTT0=I waited 'til I saw the sun\nI don't know why I didn't come \nI left y
EXTT0=ou by the house of fun \nI don't know why I didn't come \nI don't know
EXTT0=why I didn't come \n\nWhen I saw the break of day \nI wished that I c
EXTT0=ould fly away \nInstead of kneeling in the sand \nCatching teardrops i
EXTT0=n my hand \n\nMy heart is drenched in wine \nBut you'll be on my mind 
EXTT0=\nForever \n\nOut across the endless sea \nI would die in ecstasy \nBu
EXTT0=t I'll be a bag of bones \nDriving down the road alone \n\nMy heart is
EXTT0=drenched in wine \nBut you'll be on my mind \nForever \n\nSomething h
EXTT0=as to make you run \nI don't know why I didn't come \nI feel as empty 
EXTT0=as a drum \nI don't know why I didn't come \nDon't know why I didn't c
EXTT0=ome \nI don't know why I didn't come
