EXTD=© 2005 Capitol Records, Inc.\n\nOriginally Released September 13,
EXTD=2005\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Souls Alike is the first album in Bo
EXTD=nnie Raitt's 18-disc catalog to bear her own name as producer wit
EXTD=h some assistance from Tchad Blake. It is also the first album in
EXTD=her career absent a 12-bar blues. Gone are the big washes of sou
EXTD=nd that Don Was added to her Grammy-winning recordings, and the s
EXTD=ound Raitt has chosen for herself is a bit edgier, far more adven
EXTD=turous than Silver Lining, her last studio offering produced by B
EXTD=lake. Guitars -- courtesy of the artist and George Marinelli -- d
EXTD=ominate, and are accented by Jon Cleary's Hammond B3, which paint
EXTD=s the entire proceeding with a solid, somewhat funky yet outsider
EXTD=soul feel. Raitt keeps everything close to the vest this time ou
EXTD=t. Her road band and a handful of guests who include Mitchell Fro
EXTD=om, Maia Sharp, David Batteau, and Sweet Pea Atkinson carried thi
EXTD=s project to fruition. What's most remarkable about Souls Alike i
EXTD=s its songs and their focus on broken love, acceptance of respons
EXTD=ibility, and the willingness to transcend. Cleary, Sharp, and Bat
EXTD=teau wrote a number of tracks, as did John Capek, who provides dr
EXTD=um loops on some cuts. It's all in the family for the most part. 
EXTD=The songs themselves reflect on self-determination (the gorgeous 
EXTD=title cut) in Raitt's trademark rock ballad style, Randall Brambl
EXTD=ett's greasy, dark and slinky "God Was in the Water," the angular
EXTD=, ultra-modern "Crooked Crown," the grimy New Orleans second-line
EXTD=groove of Cleary's "Unnecessary Mercenary" with a killer slide b
EXTD=reak by Raitt and an off-the-rails piano by Cleary. Then there's 
EXTD=the near-trip-hop of "Deep Water," a deeply sensual tune that is 
EXTD=a shock on first listen but infectious thereafter. "The Bed I Mad
EXTD=e," by Sharp and Batteau is the album's closer. With a shimmery l
EXTD=oop and Raitt's finest vocal on the set, it's a faux jazz-ballad 
EXTD=that is unsettling, full of bittersweet regret and the willingnes
EXTD=s to embrace the face in the mirror and the mistakes as a way of 
EXTD=moving through pain. It's a rather unsettling way to end an album
EXTD=, but then, this entire disc is brave and sharp. It marks a new t
EXTD=urn for Raitt and offers her and her fans an entirely new road to
EXTD=go down -- this one deep into the heart.  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAma
EXTD=zon.com Editorial Review\nAfter almost 35 years of recording, Bon
EXTD=nie Raitt knows exactly who she is and what she wants, as Souls A
EXTD=like, the first self-produced album of her career, attests. Thoug
EXTD=h Raitt wrote none of the material, the selection bears her impri
EXTD=nt and highlights both her strengths and her range. The album's o
EXTD=pening "I Will Not Be Broken" provides the sort of signature, sti
EXTD=ck-to-your-guns affirmation for Raitt that "My Way" did for Frank
EXTD=Sinatra and "I Won't Back Down" did for Tom Petty. Two songs wri
EXTD=tten by pianist Jon Cleary, "Love on One Condition" and "Unnecess
EXTD=ary Mercenary," reflect the Little Feat-in-New Orleans side to Ra
EXTD=itt's music, while the reggae underpinnings of "God Was in the Wa
EXTD=ter," the electro-worldbeat of "Deep Water," and the slide-guitar
EXTD=funk of "Trinkets" find her settling naturally into a variety of
EXTD=grooves. Though she makes a sharp left turn into the sonic surre
EXTD=alism of "Crooked Crown," she returns to the reflective balladry 
EXTD=that has marked her musical maturity with "So Close," "I Don't Wa
EXTD=nt Anything to Change," and the jazzy sophistication of the closi
EXTD=ng "The Bed I Made." While there are few surprises here, the albu
EXTD=m ranks with the most soul-satisfying of Raitt's career. --Don Mc

EXTD=he most significant change on SOULS ALIKE is its lack of overtly 
EXTD=bluesy numbers. Although Raitt's emotive singing and guitar playi
EXTD=ng almost always feature an element of the blues, that vibe is do
EXTD=wnplayed here in favor of a mellower rock atmosphere exemplified 
EXTD=by opening track "I Will Not Be Broken," a laid-back tune with a 
EXTD=deceptively defiant message. Other standouts are the dreamy "God 
EXTD=Was in the Water" and the funky, loop-laden "Deep Water," as well
EXTD=as the gorgeous closer, "The Bed I Made," which carries a light,
EXTD=jazzy feel and showcases the more delicate side of Raitt's vocal
EXTD=s. Though SOULS ALIKE does mark a bit of a departure for Raitt, i
EXTD=t's true enough to her style and strengths to retain her old fans

EXTD="Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do." Bonnie nails the 
EXTD=track, assuring a long stay in my personal top ten! Gordon Kenned

EXTD=s are among my favorites co-wrote three of the tracks on this dis

EXTD=a smoky neo-torch song that Bonnie enhances with her aching voca

EXTD=E is Bonnie Raitt at the top of her game. All the maturity and ex
EXTD=perience of this talented performer is on display here. Her vocal
EXTD=s are the right blend of worldliness and emotion and her guitar p
EXTD=laying is just stellar. The songs chosen here are a fine balance 
EXTD=of softer ballads like the pretty "So Close," to the quirky "Trin
EXTD=kets" that sounds more like one Sheryl Crow would pick, but Bonni
EXTD=e has fun with it. Even when things get funky on songs like "Croo
EXTD=ked Crown" and "Unnecessarily Mercenary," the feeling is not forc
EXTD=ed - the songs flow along. They don't sound like they were put her
EXTD=e just because something upbeat was needed. Even when the sound i
EXTD=s very different like on "Deep Water," something that almost soun

EXTD=Souls Alike" is an interesting and usually fun CD. Sure, it repre
EXTD=sents a departure from Bonnie's earlier music, but hey - after 35
EXTD=years I think a new direction can be understood. It's not like s
EXTD=he pulled a total switch here - the amazing slide guitar work, bl
EXTD=uesy rhythms and of course Bonnie's matchless vocals are all here
EXTD=To me the biggest differences are the addition of Jon Cleary's 
EXTD=brilliant, rollicking keys (Unnecessarily Mercenary and Love on O
EXTD=ne Condition) and the opening up of several songs into sparser, m
EXTD=ore groove oriented tracks (the opening track and the three softe
EXTD=r ballads). This is a rather disjointed CD, and song to song it t
EXTD=ends to throw a few curves, but that's just fine. I don't really 
EXTD=like my music too predictable, and songs like "God..." and "Love.
EXTD=" are not predictable - not to mention "Crooked Crown", a dirty
EXTD=groove if ever there was such a thing. This is a solid CD, and r
EXTD=eally blends several basic styles - blues, straight ahead rock, C
EXTD=ajun swamp music and even a little funk. I really enjoy this CD.

EXTD=ember 21, 2005 \nBy  Eric J. Anderson (Ankeny, Iowa]\n\nI'm not r
EXTD=eally sure why Bonnie Raitt continues to make studio albums. Apar
EXTD=t from the title track, I thought the last record was a dud. This
EXTD=one? Some pleasant tunes are covered here (nothing but covers, B
EXTD=onnie composed none of the songs), but only two or three that I m
EXTD=ight consider listening to more than once. \n\nRoad Tested was/is
EXTD=an amazing album. Get the DVD if you can. Preceding it, you have
EXTD=Bonnie's classic 1970's work, Nick of Time, and a few tunes on t
EXTD=he albums that followed it, which stand the test of time. \n\nCle
EXTD=arly, she continues to be a compelling performer, but she's at th
EXTD=e mercy of the material. Most of these songs do not inspire me or
EXTD=even entertain me that much. None can in any way be compared to 
EXTD=the bumping, grinding Love Letter, the raucous Thing Called Love,
EXTD=or the gut-wrenching I Can't Make You Love Me. \n\nThe recording
EXTD=quality and production on this disc are excellent. Better, in fa
EXTD=ct, than on Nick of Time. But production cannot turn a mediocre s
EXTD=ong into a classic. My advice is to listen to a stream of this al
EXTD=bum somewhere on the internet if you can find it, or check out a 
EXTD=copy from your library to preview it. Make sure you know what you
EXTD='re buying. \n\nI would love to purchase a Bonnie Raitt CD of new
EXTD=material that met the standards of her older work. This is not t
EXTD=hat CD. When I want a dose of Bonnie, I'll have to content myself
