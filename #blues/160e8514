EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nYazoo offers up another classic collection of mountain b
EXTT0=allads and old-timey heartbreakers from the '20s and '30s on Man of Co
EXTT0=nstant Sorrow. Chestnuts like "Ommie Wise," "John Hardy," "Darling Cor
EXTT0=a," and the title track are interspersed with lesser-known recording
EXTT0=s from B.F. Shelton, Grayson and Whitter, Charlie Poole, and Ernest Ston
EXTT0=eman. The Blue Sky Boys' contribution, "In the Hills of Roane County,
EXTT0=" is a chillingly beautiful high lonesome murder ballad highlighting E
EXTT0=arl and Bill Bolick's fraternal harmonies, and the youthful Cousin Emm
EXTT0=y's stark "Pretty Little Miss Out in the Garden" is accompanied intima
EXTT0=tely by her own gentle banjo picking. Surprisingly, the only clunker
EXTT0=s on the album come from the usually spectacular Eck Robertson, whos
EXTT0=e singing fiddle is unusually out of tune and he spends both of the tr
EXTT0=acks competing with a female vocalist who shouts over the top of him (
EXTT0=pre-dating Audrey Williams' offenses by a couple of decades). These 2
EXTT0=0 tracks were taken directly from rare old 78s, so some pops and crack
EXTT0=les are to be expected, but anyone with a worn-out copy of The Antholo
EXTT0=gy of American Folk Music won't mind a bit.  Zac Johnson
