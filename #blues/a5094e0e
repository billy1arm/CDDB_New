EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nMusically this a great batch of stuff, the equivalent o
EXTT0=f tuning in somebody's really fantastic rootsy radio show. It is als
EXTT0=o a bit like 14 strangers, some of who have nothing in common, acciden
EXTT0=tally meeting in a random location and deciding they all get along jus
EXTT0=t fine together. Anyone with a bit of intelligence might begin nitpick
EXTT0=ing about the philosophy of how this album has been compiled. There i
EXTT0=s obvious indecision about whether the focus is blues or bottleneck gu
EXTT0=itar. Or a third interpretation is that this is supposed to be a colle
EXTT0=ction of masterpieces. By putting The Voice of the Blues out front i
EXTT0=n the title, an immediate blues emphasis is established. That is awkwa
EXTT0=rd for some of the material that is included here, including ragtime
EXTT0=, old-time country, and Hawaiian. What everything does have in commo
EXTT0=n is the bottleneck guitar, but this may have become a peg to hang th
EXTT0=e collection of tracks on simply because it is so popular amongst blue
EXTT0=s listeners, continually being discovered with much enthusiasm by eac
EXTT0=h new generation. Because masterpiece or not, each track has a differe
EXTT0=nt degree of involvement with the bottleneck, sometimes major and some
EXTT0=times minor. "Ground Hog Blues" by Rambling Thomas is for sure a bottl
EXTT0=eneck blues, with the sound of the quavering slide licks totally domin
EXTT0=ating the proceedings. "Decatur Street 81" by the Georgia Browns is so
EXTT0=mething of an instrumental masterpiece, but the bottleneck is there on
EXTT0=ly as a hard-working member of the trio, adding simple and carefully w
EXTT0=orked-out parts to the overall sound. This track could have just as ea
EXTT0=sily been folded into a compilation of hot harmonica music. If this i
EXTT0=s taken as some kind of overview of bottleneck guitar techniques, it i
EXTT0=s haphazard and incomplete. Most of the music is from the '20s and '30
EXTT0=s, yet there is also one track from the '50s, and it is a gospel guita
EXTT0=r number at that. Is this on the album just because it was lying aroun
EXTT0=d, or because it was the only bottleneck guitar masterpiece recorded i
EXTT0=n the '50s? The answer is surely no to the latter question, but it i
EXTT0=s great to have Sister O.M. Terrell on hand anyway, playing a wrist-cr
EXTT0=acking, jumping National steel style that brings to mind Mississippi F
EXTT0=red McDowell a few years prior to puberty. This track combined with th
EXTT0=e excellent Irene Scruggs track on the flip side provides an extra att
EXTT0=raction within this collection of songs. Material by female country bl
EXTT0=ues artists is rare, and listeners will certainly be interested in hea
EXTT0=ring more by both gals. The second side does have a slight problem i
EXTT0=n the overwhelming quality of one particular track, Roy Smeck's "Laugh
EXTT0=ing Rag." This is guitar playing of such outrageous virtuosity that th
EXTT0=e songs before and after would limp off with their heads between thei
EXTT0=r hands if they were able to assume human form. The worst hit is the t
EXTT0=rack immediately before, because despite the lack of much interestin
EXTT0=g slide work other than a bit of mild chording, it is hyped as "one o
EXTT0=f the rare ragtime works ever attempted by a bottleneck guitarist." Uh
EXTT0=, what is it that Roy Smeck is doing, then? Hint: It is called "Laughi
EXTT0=ng Rag." Sam Butler kicks off the side with another fine example of th
EXTT0=e kind of playing consumers who think this is all going to be slide bl
EXTT0=ues are probably looking for. These same listeners should still enjo
EXTT0=y the cornpone "She's a Hum Dum Dinger From Dingersville" by Jimmie Da
EXTT0=vis, as it has an especially sweet bottleneck guitar part to it an
EXTT0=d a tempo change to boot. The conclusion is a version of "When the Sai
EXTT0=nts Go Marchin' In" by Blind Willie Davis that works beautifully.  Eu
