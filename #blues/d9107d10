EXTD=Live In Boston 1970 - Disc 2 of 3 (Second Show]\n2007 Bright Midnight Archives/Rhino\n\nOriginally Released July 24, 2007\nRecorded April 10, 1970\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  Several 1970 Doors concerts were officially recorded for use on the Absolutely

EXTD=Door Man"). There are also a bunch of unexpected covers that, as enticing as they look on paper, are rather fragmentary and half-developed (and sometimes thrown in the middle of another tune), like "Mystery Train," "Fever," "Rock Me," "Crossroads,"

EXTD=represents all the different facets of Morrison's personality and his soul: the charming poet, shy schoolboy, redneck, exhibitionist, lovable rogue, class clown and drunk. I find it funny that people love Morrison for his words and his insight, but
EXTD=they can't deal with the reality of what shaped his vision and altered his perception. It's kinda like saying..."William S. Burroughs is a great writer and I love his books, but I saw him at a reading and he was strung out on heroin." DUH... \n\n\n

EXTD=y sloppy. Krieger is having a bad night. Densmore's timing is shakey. And the usually reliable Manzarek stumbles through out. There are some technical problems, but that's not an excuse, they're all off. \n\nHowever, at times Morrison's heart is in 
EXTD=the right place. He just can't deliver. He's bombed and just wants to talk to the crowd. They lifted the "Astrology" rap from the second show for the American Prayer album. But, very few people buy a live album because of the between songs chatter.

EXTD=(Chicago]\nLive In Boston is easily the weakest live Doors album yet. Jim is drunk and his performance seriously suffers. I was able to tolerate (and even enjoy) most of it, but I would not be surprised if someone shut this off after a few songs. S
EXTD=adly, Jim only gets worse as the show goes on. A lack of pro-recorded shows and the ability to market this as "Jim Morrison at his wildest!" are the only reasons why this show is being released. If you have all the previous live Doors releases and d
