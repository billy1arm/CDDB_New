EXTD=93\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This two-CD box set includes all of the top singl
EXTD=es and many of the flip sides that Martha Reeves and the Vandellas cut for M
EXTD=otown. All the hits are here, of course - the collector will be especially 
EXTD=interested in the B-sides and non-hit singles, many of which employed the 
EXTD=songwriting talents of Motown regulars like Holland-Dozier-Holland and Mic
EXTD=key Stevenson. There's also the rare single (featuring Gloria Williamson o
EXTD=n lead vocals) cut by the Vells in 1962, before Reeves took top billing an
EXTD=d the group changed their name. Eight of these cuts have never been releas
EXTD=ed on album before. Among the non-hits, there isn't anything to match "Hea
EXTD=t Wave" or "Dancing in the Street," but Reeves' astonishingly powerful voi
EXTD=ce never falters. She was arguably Motown's most talented female singer, b
EXTD=ut the label's investment in her seemed to flag as the decade progressed. 
EXTD=The later material lacks the distinction of her classic period, though the
EXTD=1970 album track "I Should Be Proud" is a little-known (if somewhat heavy
EXTD=handed) protest against the Vietnam War. -- Richie Unterberger\n\nAmazon.

EXTD=jewels are all great on this set, however what really makes this release

EXTD=re in Amazon-com a single day longer devoid of even the least praise. That
EXTD='s almost as much a shame as the fact that Motown hasn't kept this superb 
EXTD=set in print. I see also that the track listings aren't posted as I write 
EXTD=this, so let me address that first.\n\nThe set contains 43 selections on t

EXTD=dy For Love - if you've read this far, you know this list. Even latter day
EXTD=sides that were, frankly, relative commercial stiffs are here: I Should B
EXTD=e Proud, Sweet Darling', Taking My Love And Leaving Me. What's new here is
EXTD=the instances where very rare 'B' sides that never (or almost never) made
EXTD=it to LP or CD are included. Remember 'Darling I Hum Our Song,' 'Never Le
EXTD=ave Your Baby's Side,' 'A Tear For The Girl' and the unforgettable 'Third 
EXTD=Finger, Left Hand'? They're here. The only items I found missing - and it'
EXTD=s hardly a major complaint - were a couple of 'B's' like 'Old Love Let's T
EXTD=ry It Again' and 'Dancing Slow.' But, without question, this is (was) the 
EXTD=most satisfying collection of Martha and the Vandellas Motown EVER offered t
EXTD=heir fans. I bought it on August 1, 1994 and, for now, you have to settle 
EXTD=for it used if you want it. I sure WOULD.\n\nBy a few weeks Steve Wonder b

EXTD=the year I was nine. But between his "Fingertips" and their "Heat Wave" th
EXTD=e beginning of my lifelong love of Motown was born. And I think I'm as 'br
EXTD=and loyal' a consumer as they come. Martha and Stevie had me well primed for
EXTD=when the Supremes, Four Tops and Temptations broke through big-time the fol
EXTD=lowing year. But I didn't leave anyone behind. It had no impact on me, for
EXTD=instance, to learn later that Vandellas' sides "Live Wire" and "In My Lonel
EXTD=y Room" were poorer chart entries than "Heat Wave" and "Quicksand," which 
EXTD=preceded them. All I needed to know is that they were Martha and the Vandell
EXTD=as records. For the rest of my life, I never left one of their 45s sitting
EXTD=in any record store if it was one I didn't have. That ought to give you a
