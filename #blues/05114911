EXTD=s it is with the multiple Woodstock soundtrack albums, it's hard 
EXTD=to keep up with what's on the soundtrack discs bearing the name W
EXTD=attstax in the title, counting the two initial volumes that came 
EXTD=out in the 1970s, and now this three-CD package. Making matters m
EXTD=ore confusing is how, as the title of this set infers, the albums
EXTD=mix music from the festival with music from, or somehow associat
EXTD=ed with, the film Wattstax (which had some scenes, musical and ot
EXTD=herwise, that actually didn't take place at the Wattstax festival
EXTD=itself). And to make matters yet more confusing, Music from the 
EXTD=Wattstax Festival and Film, for all its generous length, isn't simp
EXTD=ly a combination of the Wattstax music that appeared in the '70s 
EXTD=on either Wattstax, The Living Word: Live Concert Music from the 
EXTD=Original Movie Soundtrack or Wattstax: The Living Word, Vol. 2. A
EXTD=lot of tracks from those albums do appear on these three CDs, bu
EXTD=t some don't - plus, Music from the Wattstax Festival and Film adds 
EXTD=17 previously unreleased songs, as well as one (Isaac Hayes' "The
EXTD=me from Shaft") that previously appeared on Isaac Hayes at Wattst
EXTD=ax. It's something of a head-hurting exercise to keep it all stra
EXTD=ight. But ultimately, the most important thing to bear in mind is
EXTD=that Music from the Wattstax Festival and Film is the best, and ce
EXTD=rtainly most bountiful, of the Wattstax-spawned discs, though it'
EXTD=s marred by the exclusion of some previously issued tracks from t
EXTD=he other Wattstax releases.\n\nMost of this was indeed recorded a
EXTD=t the Wattstax festival on August 20, 1972, featuring live soul f
EXTD=rom many artists on the Stax label. Most of the best performances
EXTD=from the previous Wattstax iterations were retained, among them 
EXTD=well-recorded selections by the Staple Singers (whose four songs 
EXTD=include "Respect Yourself" and "I'll Take You There"), Eddie Floy
EXTD=d (doing "Knock on Wood"), the Bar-Kays (whose nine-minute "Son o
EXTD=f Shaft/Feel It" is a highlight), Albert King, Carla Thomas, John
EXTD=nie Taylor (with an eight-minute "Steal Away"), the Emotions, and
EXTD=Rufus Thomas. Some of the best cuts, however, are found in the d
EXTD=ynamic previously unreleased material by lesser-known Stax artist
EXTD=s, like Louise McCord's "Better Get a Move On," Lee Sain's "Them 
EXTD=Hot Pants," Little Sonny's funk-blues "Wade in the Water," the Ne
EXTD=wcomers' Jackson Five-like "Pin the Tail on the Donkey," and Mel 
EXTD=& Tim's hit "Backfield in Motion." The addition of some gospel so
EXTD=ngs also reflects the breadth of music at the festival, though th
EXTD=e gospel tunes aren't as inspiring as the soul ones. On the whole
EXTD=, it's an important document of some of the better, live-'70s sou
EXTD=l recordings. Arguably, however, some of the less interesting, pr
EXTD=eviously unissued songs, should have been excluded to make room f
EXTD=or some tracks by Albert King, Johnny Taylor, and Little Milton t

EXTD=m. -- Richie Unterberger\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\nCalling 
EXTD=this August 1972 concert comprised exclusively of Stax artists "W
EXTD=attstock" or even the "black Woodstock" pushes the boundaries of 
EXTD=the day-long event past its breaking point. But there is no doubt
EXTD=that Wattstax, held in a jittery post-riot Watts atmosphere, was
EXTD=an iconic cultural milestone deserving of a better recorded lega
EXTD=cy than the two double albums that initially emerged from it, bot
EXTD=h of which were surreptitiously padded with studio tracks to enha
EXTD=nce the roster. This three-disc, nearly four-hour-long deluxe 35t
EXTD=h anniversary edition gets it right--or more right--by excluding 
EXTD=the bogus material, adding a over an hour of previously unrelease
EXTD=d music, and presenting it in an expanded package that includes a
EXTD=detailed essay by Stax historian Rob Bowman. The show's gospel a
EXTD=spect is further highlighted with plenty of Staple Singers, the a
EXTD=mazing Rance Allen Group, and obscure blues harp player Little So
EXTD=nny ripping into an instrumental version of "Wade in the Water." 
EXTD=Comedy snippets from a young Richard Pryor and Jesse Jackson's op
EXTD=ening speech, which appeared in the associated film, could have b
EXTD=een excised, but nearly entire sets from Carla and Rufus Thomas, 
EXTD=the Bar-Kays, and David Porter are worthy additions. Only the ubi
EXTD=quitous "Theme from Shaft" remains from Isaac Hayes's hour-long c
EXTD=losing, but his full performance is available separately. The Emo
EXTD=tions, Johnny Taylor, Little Milton, and a few others who didn't 
EXTD=play the actual festival were recorded at other L.A. venues in th
EXTD=e days around the concert, bringing a bit of a spurious element t
EXTD=o this otherwise classy souvenir from a historically important an

EXTD=EW\nblown away..., October 10, 2007 \nBy  Eddie Landsberg "jazz o
EXTD=rganist and Jazz/Soul ... (Tokyo, Japan]\nThis album is unbelieva
EXTD=ble and the epitome of a one-of-a-kind/no other like it listening
EXTD=experience... \n\nI remember coming across the original WATTSAX 
EXTD=album back in the 80's when I was a 70's soul collector in HS... 
EXTD=and for the next several years it became staple listening via the
EXTD=tape copies I'd carry around visa vis my Sony Walkmans... Needle
EXTD=ss to say, the discovery of a second volume of the "mythical" con
EXTD=cert blew me away, and I liked it just as much if not more... I l
EXTD=oved the album not only because of all the great music... but the
EXTD=way it really took you back to a lost world... at a time when pe
EXTD=ople were celebrating a very vibrant musical and artistic culture
EXTD=Not to over romantisize... the community had been through a lot
EXTD=of pain, and were healing and rebuilding from the Watts riots...
EXTD=Rather than focusing, however, on what had been "burnt down", th
EXTD=e concert was a celebration of what was being built up... and wow
EXTD=imagine what it must have been like to be at that cocnert... 
EXTD= As for the film... you know something: I never even DREAMED o
EXTD=f being able to see it, because I assumed it was probably one of 
EXTD=those lost things... Needless to say, when it came out almost 20 
EXTD=years later after I heard the album the first time, I was definit
EXTD=ely THRILLED... (especially after people taunted me of having sup
EXTD=posedly seen it on PBS... "Yeah really, anybody got a copy?" I'd 
EXTD=ask...) Wishful thinking... \n\nO.K. now... look at this: Now onl
EXTD=y is a three box set out... but tracks that never made the origin
EXTD=al album, and with the sound cleaned up. - - As Jesse Jackson poi
EXTD=nts out the concert had everything... Gospel, Funk, Blues, Soul, 
EXTD=R&B... Listening to the tracks I never heard before is definitely
EXTD=a thrill, though in retrospect I can tell why some were left off
EXTD=the original album... a lot of the performances were POWERFULLY 
EXTD=GREAT... but some of the smaller groups sounded like some of the 
EXTD=other groups... so the big groups had to take priority. \n\nIn co
EXTD=nclusion - - Just as WOODSTOCK was the big "party like its the en
EXTD=d of the world" goodbye to the 60's, WATTSTAX was also somewhat o
EXTD=f a final goodbye too, as even that empire would crumble shortly 
EXTD=after... Also gone is much of the culture and spirit of the era..
EXTD=The only catch is, I think this was actually filmed and recorde
EXTD=d WAY BETTER than WOODSTOCK, and far from being lost in time, its
EXTD=a gift passed through time... \n\nRegarding my favorite tracks..
EXTD=Back in the day I leaned towards RUFUS THOMAS and the DRAMATICS
EXTD=(omitted)... as well as the EMOTIONS unbelievably riveting perfo
EXTD=rmance... but I'm also majorly digging the newly added stuff... i
EXTD=n particular Louis McCord's "Do Your Thing'ish" Better Get a Move
EXTD=On... as well as Lee Sain's THEM HOT PANTS. \n\nOf course, STAX 
EXTD=in the '60s were the epitome of classic soul... however, this rec
EXTD=ord as well as the (hard to find) SON OF STAX compilation is a gr
EXTD=eat reminder that the label definitely didn't fall short when it 
EXTD=came to funk as well... \n\nFor the complete story read "Soulsvil
EXTD=le U.S.A.: The Story Of Stax Records" by Rob Bowman. \n\nO.K. the
EXTD=big question: When's some more SHACK going to get unearthed? \n\n
