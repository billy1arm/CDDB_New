EXTD=EW: Ray Charles' seminal recordings for Atlantic have been boxed 
EXTD=once before, as the triple-disc 1991 set The Birth of Soul. That 
EXTD=box contained 53 tracks, the best moments of what is arguably the
EXTD=best period of Charles' career, but Rhino/Atlantic's 2005 seven-
EXTD=disc sequel, Pure Genius, doesn't bother with merely the highligh
EXTD=ts: as its subtitle makes clear, this is The Complete Atlantic Re
EXTD=cordings (1952-1959). This is undeniably a major historical relea
EXTD=se, since it gathers all of the recordings Charles made at his cr
EXTD=eative peak, not just as a leader, but as a sideman for his saxop
EXTD=honist David "Fathead" Newman and sides he recorded with jazz vib
EXTD=raphonist Milt Jackson. Also, it's not limited to studio recordin
EXTD=gs -- live sessions, later issued on the LPs Ray Charles in Perso
EXTD=n and Ray Charles at Newport, are here too. Despite the abundance
EXTD=of music here, there's not much that hasn't seen the light of da
EXTD=y before. It may not seem that way at first glance, since the sev
EXTD=enth disc contains nothing but unreleased material, but the great
EXTD=majority of that is devoted to a full-length rehearsal session w
EXTD=ith producer Ahmet Ertegun from 1953 -- something that is interes
EXTD=ting to hear once, since it does give some insights into Ertegun 
EXTD=and Charles' working relationship and how Ray acted in the studio
EXTD=, but even then, it's not exactly revelatory. So, apart from that
EXTD=rehearsal, outtakes of "(Night Time Is) The Right Time" and "Tel
EXTD=l Me How Do You Feel" and an excellent DVD of Ray live at Newport
EXTD=from 1960, Pure Genius is devoted to material that has been reis
EXTD=sued extensively during the CD era -- which is another way of say
EXTD=ing that most fans will have this music already. Still, presented
EXTD=here in chronological order according to recording sessions, it'
EXTD=s hard not to marvel at Charles' development as an artist and be 
EXTD=astonished by his range. That is what makes this set worthwhile a
EXTD=s something more than a library piece -- listening to the first s
EXTD=ix discs from beginning to end reveals exactly how restless and c
EXTD=reative Ray was during this period. Most listeners will be satisf
EXTD=ied by more concise collections of this period -- and even those 
EXTD=who truly love the hard R&B and soul of Charles' Atlantic hits wi
EXTD=ll likely find The Birth of Soul a more satisfying box, since it 
EXTD=is devoted to that sound, whereas the rest of the music here that
EXTD='s not on the 1991 box is largely devoted to jazz sides and live 
EXTD=performances -- but any serious fan or historian of American musi
EXTD=c will find this set essential. (Nevertheless, they may find the 
EXTD=packaging of the set somewhat infuriating: it's a clever, well-de
EXTD=signed replica of an old-fashioned, all-in-one record player, wit
EXTD=h the hardcover book and eight discs stored inside. It's a nice p
EXTD=ackage, but a bit impractical, particularly for those who just wa

EXTD=While the singer's recorded output for the label was typically

EXTD=ormances that range from a lengthy 1953 rehearsal tape to a handf

EXTD=ly gives you a sense of how Ray Charles grew as an artist and set
EXTD=the stage for Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, Wils
EXTD=on Pickett, etc. Ray starts as a great boogie piano artist - "Mes
EXTD=s Around" is his finest early moment, but then, on track 18 of Di
EXTD=sc 1, he explodes with "I've Got A Woman," the blueprint for his 
EXTD=style and the "feel" of much of Atlantic's soul and R&B artists. 
EXTD=It's a driving track that sounds as vibrant today as it did back 
EXTD=then. \nRay Charles was a master of both jumping R&B ("What'd I S
EXTD=ay") and soulful ballads ("Lonely Avenue,""Don't Let The Sun Catc
EXTD=h You Crying") and nearly every cut is a polished jewel. Since th
EXTD=is is a "Complete" release of Ray's Atlantic sides, it includes h
EXTD=is jazz outings with David Newman and Milt Jackson. They are fine
EXTD=, but interrupt the flow of the soulful vocals. \nHis live work i
EXTD=s well represented with a live set from 1958 and on the DVD with 
EXTD=a rocking set at the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival. \nDisc 7 is an u
EXTD=nreleased "rehearsal Session" with Ahmet Ertegun and shows what a
EXTD=n amazing pianist Ray Charles was. I hope there is more of this "
EXTD=acoustic" Ray material in the vault that will get official releas
EXTD=e. It's like being a fly on the wall at a recording session and I
EXTD=compulsively played the session 3 times in a row when I first go
EXTD=t to it. The sound quality is first-rate across all 8 discs - the
EXTD=brilliant Raylettes, Ray's backup singers, never sounded so good
EXTD=\nI've docked the set one star because of the lack of any finis
EXTD=hed unreleased material from the Atlantic years. There have to be
EXTD=numerous unreleased numbers, instrumentals, and outtakes in the 
EXTD=Atlantic vaults and the many Ray Charles fans anxiously await the
EXTD=next box set: "The Complete Unreleased Atlantic Recordings." \n\n
