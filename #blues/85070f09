EXTD=oration between Al Green and producer Willie Mitchell, Have a Goo
EXTD=d Time found the dynamic duo in the midst of a creative crossroad
EXTD=s. Green had just purchased a church and was looking to pour his 
EXTD=energies into his congregation and his newly appointed title of R
EXTD=everend. While the message and tones of religion aren't as obviou
EXTD=s on Have a Good Time as they were on Full of Fire, they still do
EXTD=make appearances here and there. But it wasn't just a change in 
EXTD=Green's life that made Have a Good Time so distinct from the earl
EXTD=ier classics - it was also the changing shift in cultural tastes (
EXTD=thanks in no small part to the emergence of disco to the forefron
EXTD=t of America's collective dance consciousness). With style shifts
EXTD=and members of a once solid backing band going their own way, th
EXTD=e writing on the wall couldn't have been any clearer to both Gree
EXTD=n and Mitchell. With Have a Good Time they recapture moments of c
EXTD=lassic collaboration, the wonderful "Nothing Takes the Place of Y

EXTD=of "Keep Me Cryin'," Green's latest single and a song from Have a
EXTD=Good Time: "Well I pleased all the people/But I couldn't please 
EXTD=the crowd/So I got down on my knees and said/Father, wouldn't you
EXTD=clear my head/They keep me crying all the time." What makes the 
EXTD=thing even stranger is the song's foundation: a sprightly rhythm 
EXTD=topped by a sweet alto, and brassy trumpet fanfares replacing the
EXTD=usually dark and moody Memphis horns. Somehow the apparent contr
