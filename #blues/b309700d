EXTD=Just Roll Tape: April 26, 1968\n2007 Eyewall Records/Rhino Entertainment Company\n\nOriginally Released July 10, 2007\nOriginally Recorded April 26, 1968\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:  When listening to this rather remarkable document, it becomes alarmingly
EXTD=clear what the post-Buffalo Springfield Stephen Stills brought to the partnership of Crosby, Stills and Nash. This 13-song set was recorded solo with an acoustic in a recording studio in 1968, preceding by a few months the first CS&N recording (he br
EXTD=ibed a recording engineer after a Judy Collins session). According to Stills' brief liner notes, the tape had been lost for nearly 40 years, until the release of this edition. Meaning, of course, that these versions of these songs haven't been widel
EXTD=y available on the bootleg circuit, either. The tracks contain early versions of cuts recorded in the trio such as "Suite: Judy Blues Eyes," "Helplessly Hoping," and "Wooden Ships." But these are near the very end of the collection. There are also a
EXTD=number of cuts here that Stills recorded on his solo records such as "Black Queen," from his self-titled debut, "Change Partners" and "Know You Got to Run" from Two Originals, "So Begins the Task" from Manassas, and even a very earlier and much lon
EXTD=ger version of "Treetop Flyer" with Stills playing dobro. In addition to the better-known material are the haunting "The Doctor Will See You Now," the melancholy yet tender melodrama of "Dreaming of Snakes," and "Judy," a short tune that is, coincid
EXTD=entally and perhaps, a precursor to the "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes." These are demos, unpolished, unfinished, sketches -- albeit most of them fully realized -- of classic material. It's unexplainable as to why some of the unreleased material didn't ulti
EXTD=mately make it onto finished records: quality is not the issue. The sound is a little distorted and uneven but the quality is very good considering this tape sat basically neglected for nearly four decades. Sadly, the sheer quality of the material, 
EXTD=even in this raw state, also brings into the glaring light of day the fact that Stills is now but a ghost of his former self creatively. His reunion appearances with CS&N and CSN&Y, and latter recordings reveal his songwriting well to be run dry. On
EXTD=e has to wonder if he could ever again be so inspired and what it might take. (Many still wonder what inspired Dylan to scale the heights once more after a long period of lackluster recordings.) Nonetheless, Stills' lack of good material in later ye
EXTD=ars doesn't diminish his lasting contribution. The work from those early years is so substantial that his songs remain a watermark for anyone who aspires to be a songwriter. [A U.K. version of the CD was also released.]  -- Thom Jurek\n\n\nAmazon.co
EXTD=m Editorial Review\nThe title and cover art effectively tell the story of this dusty gem. Captured fly-on-the-wall style in an impromptu live-in-the-studio burst after a Judy Collins session on which the 23-year-old Stephen Stills played, the soon-t
EXTD=o-be ex-leader of Buffalo Springfield (and Collins's ex-boyfriend) unleashes unplugged, occasionally incomplete versions of songs he had recently written and wanted to get on tape. Discovered in 1978 and nearly discarded, the reels found their way t
EXTD=o Graham Nash in 2003, who encouraged Stills to release them. He finally did so in 2007, nearly 40 years after the original session, and the result is the most revelatory album in Stills's bulging catalog. Even with remastering, the sound is on the 
EXTD=crude side. Nevertheless, early takes of "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," "Helplessly Hoping," and "Wooden Ships," all of which would appear in far more polished versions on Crosby, Stills and Nash's self-titled debut, are sung with a passion and honesty seld
EXTD=om exposed by the singer/songwriter. Stills's voice sometimes cracks, his guitar work intermittently sounds muddy, and these are definitely works in progress, some of which never appeared on an official release. Yet the artist is caught arguably at 
EXTD=the peak of his substantial talents, laying down soon-to-be-classic melodies while they were fresh in his head. Folk/rock historians and Stills fans will surely be thrilled with this nascent, unvarnished set. Though Just Roll Tape may be too raw for
EXTD=some, it finds Stills at the crucial stage right before superstardom changed his--and popular music's--future forever. --Hal Horowitz \n\nAmazon.com Product Description\nStephen Stills found himself in a New York recording studio, laid down a few h
EXTD=undred dollars, told the engineer to roll tape, and this collection of songs is what came about. Finally remastered and released to the public, this album shows the beginnings of Crosby, Still, and Nash. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nThrilled St

EXTD=as good as I had hoped for., August 9, 2007 \nBy  R. S. Chance "Bob" (Adelaide Australia]\nRhino's latest offering from Stephen Stills has been rated very high for what is basically a demo session. This over rates the album compared with Stills prev

EXTD=and hope future releases will be of better quality. On the positive side there are three good versions of previously released tracks "Black Queen", "Wooden Ships", "Tree Top Flyer" (nice dobro but the track is a much later recording). The unrelease

EXTD=ecordings of both guitar and vocals are dismal. In conclusion I would have preferred to see the better tracks in a box set, Stephen Stills is a fine artist and these demos don't seem to do him justice. Recommend for Fans. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER R

EXTD=A Master at Work, July 29, 2007 \nBy  Michael DENNISUK (trenton, michigan USA]\nWOW!! This is truly a long lost treasure! An acoustic studio session recorded after a Judy Collins recording session. Stills is just beginning to reach the height of his

EXTD=thing you never thought you'd be able to experience. At this point Stills was creating some of the most finely-crafted stuff around, in full and remarkable voice, and better still, was completely uninhibited by the demands of an audience or stardom.

EXTD=been supremely frustrated by so much of the over produced crap that has come out over the years. The irony is that a lot of the studio manipulation was at the hands of Stills who could apparently not leave well enough alone. Neil has been much bett

EXTD=2007 \nBy  o dubhthaigh (north rustico, pei, canada]\nespecially for Stills. Most of the material has appeared elsewhere, but there is an unpretentious charm to these quick takes by Stills. The unfamiliar pieces will have bits and pieces reshaped i
EXTD=n later tunes, but it is an honest effort by Stills to preserve some moments of genuine inspiration before he awoke from their spell. \nWhat amazes me as well is that listening to Stills sing on these and miss on more than once is that it is likely 
EXTD=only Crosby who can hit a melody and keep it in tune on the first go and every go thereafter. Stills frequently misses by a country mile. Tha rawness of these efforts though compensates for the errors. That he can run through BLACK QUEEN so selfless
EXTD=ly and with such a simplified honesty somehow makes it a different, if not stronger song than the version on his first solo record. The two songs for Judy Collins are touching. For all the bravado he too often succumbs to, Stills at this point must 
EXTD=still have been smarting from the break-up. At this point in his career he was without a girlfriend, without a contract and without his compadre Young. This is a Stills with his tail between his legs. I believe this also represents the first recordi

EXTD=otably Elvis Costello, it's enough already - you get the sense it was a bloody miracle that a song happened. In the case of Stills, the raw material is compelling in its own right and knowing what you do of his golden period from CSN through the fir
EXTD=st Manassas record, you have to admire the level of inspiration and craftsmanship on display. \nAnd then there is the guitar playing - Stills is actually more impressive when he is not showing off, and thus this record is a keeper for any Stills fan
EXTD=The only negative elements of this release are that some of the songs are second tier, and the sound quality is very hissy. Very. Given that these takes exist at all, it is a small price to pay to catch a glimpse of someone on the cusp of incredib

EXTD=our spine. \n\nStephen might disagree, but this man was born to be an acoustic player. The moment he picks up an electric, forget it. This album is all acoustic and completely unmolested. Perfect natural sound. Very well worth your greenbacks, folks

EXTD=the opposite, it's a godsend. It's unbelievable that some of these (like "Change Partners") were held back for years and others ("All I Know Is What You Tell Me," "The Doctor Will See You Now," "Judy" and "Dreaming of Snakes") were left behind. \n\n
