EXTD=the packaging is excellent, with a five page biography by Colin E

EXTD=ider", "Hang Up My Rock 'n' Roll shoes' and perhaps "What Am I Li
EXTD=ving For?" and "It's Too Late", be prepared to become slowly but 
EXTD=surely enamored with the genius of Chuck Willis, both as his gene
EXTD=ration's premiere songwriter and as a remarkably appealing and ve
EXTD=rsatile singer. His voice, his phrasing, his lyrics and above all
EXTD=his sincerity were matchless in the fifties, and it came across 
EXTD=in every conceivable style of song. The pure blues delivery of "W
EXTD=hatcha Gonna Do When Your Baby Leaves You" is in marked contrast 
EXTD=to the sweetly sung "You'll Be My Love" or the bouncy shuffle of 
EXTD="From The Bottom Of My Heart" but he could pull each mood off bri
EXTD=lliantly. In between he could rock, roll, moan and stroll with eq
EXTD=ual aplomb. The session players, typically for Atlantic were the 
EXTD=best in the business with the rough and tumble sax players, eithe
EXTD=r "Daddy" Gene Barge, Sam "The Man" Taylor or King Curtis, partic
EXTD=ularly standout. The Atlantic staff's production with Willis was 
EXTD=often adventurish, utilizing everything from mirambas to steel gu
EXTD=itars, and he was often backed by the Cookies who Ray Charles lat
EXTD=er copped from him and redubbed the Raelettes. All told, Willis c
EXTD=ut a heckuva lot of gems in just six officially logged sessions o
EXTD=ver these two years.\n\nWithout question the single most talented
