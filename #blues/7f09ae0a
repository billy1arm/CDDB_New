EXTD=Various Artist - Carnegie Hall presents Lift Every Voice [Honoring The A
EXTD=frican American Musical Legacy]\n\n(2009]\n\n-- liner notes --\n\n
EXTD=For over 100 years, Carnegie Hall has been a showcase for the glo
EXTD=be's finest Musicians.  \nPart of its venerable lore is that a ma
EXTD=n was once walking the streets of Manhattan in search\n of the ve
EXTD=nue.  He asked a passing stranger, "How do I get to Carnegie Hall
EXTD=?"  The other \nman deadpanned, "Practice, practice, practice."  
EXTD=African-American performers as diverse as \nsoprano Jessye Norman
EXTD=and folk maven Odetta to Ray Charles's swamp blues and James \nD
EXTD=ePreist's swirling classical baton have graced that hallowed stag
EXTD=e.\n\nFunded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1890, Carnegie H
EXTD=all is to the U.S. what the \nPalladium is to London and the Acro
EXTD=polis is to Athens.  Until Congress passed the Civil \nRights Act
EXTD=of 1964, most of America's preeminent concert locales were segre
EXTD=gated in \npractice if not in principle.  However, Carnegie Hall 
EXTD=has always held its doors open to \nblack artists, and this CD "L
EXTD=ift Every Voice A Celebration of the African American Cultural \n
EXTD=Legacy" shines as an audible light on this stellar history.\n\nSi
EXTD=ssieretta Jones was the first African-American to perform at Carn
EXTD=egie.  Discovered by \nthe manager of opera diva Adelina Patti, J
EXTD=ones sang there with the World Fair's Colored \nOpera Company in 
EXTD=February 1892 and then headlined later that year.  A scribe for "
EXTD=The \nNew York Echo" newspaper wrote, "If Madame Jones is not the
EXTD=equal of Adelina Patti, \nshe at least can come nearer [to] it t
EXTD=han anything the American public has heard.  Her \nnotes are as c
EXTD=lear as a mockingbird's and her enunciation is perfect."\n\nBegin
EXTD=ning in 1910, the Music School Settlement for Colored People and 
EXTD=the Clef Club \nsponsored five years of annual concerts, featurin
EXTD=g artists such as Roland Hayes.  Hayes, \nthe world's highest-pai
EXTD=d tenor in the 1920s, returned on February 5, 1924 to make histor
EXTD=y \nas the first black to give a full-length recital at Carnegie.
EXTD=Included here is his previously \nunreleased recording of "Du b
EXTD=ist die Ruh'" (You Are Peace), which was recorded in April \n1942
EXTD=a few months before he made national headlines for being beaten 
EXTD=by Georgia police \nbecause his daughter sat in a whites-only sec
EXTD=tion of a shoe store.\n\nSoprano Leontyne Price is also among the
EXTD=black classical artists featured on this CD, in \na recording of
EXTD="Un bel dì" from Puccini's "Madama Butterfly."  Price was a freq
EXTD=uent visitor \nto Carnegie Hall in her long and storied career - e
EXTD=lsewhere, she enjoyed a level of glamorous \nsuccess and acceptan
EXTD=ce that had been denied to earlier generations of black performer
EXTD=s.  \nContralto Marian Anderson and baritone Paul Robeson were al
EXTD=ways welcomed at Carnegie \nHall, even when they were barred from
EXTD=performing in other venues.  Anderson was not \ninvited to sing 
EXTD=at the Metropolitan Opera until 1955, when she was well past her 
EXTD=vocal prime.  \nShe had made her Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1
EXTD=928, over a decade before her dramatic \nperformance in Washingto
EXTD=n on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, after the Daughters of \n
EXTD=the American Revolution refused to allow her to perform in the ca
EXTD=pital's Constitution Hall.  \nShe chose Carnegie Hall for her con
EXTD=cert farewell, in a performance on Easter Sunday 1965.  \nAccused
EXTD=of being a communist because of his outspoken advocacy of civil 
EXTD=rights, Robeson \nmade his Hall debut in 1929 and was a frequent 
EXTD=return artist.  "Ol' Man River" from Show \nBoat was always one o
EXTD=f his crowd-pleasers, in which his resounding baritone boomed as 
EXTD=if \nit were the voice of God.\n\nTalent scout John Hammond, who 
EXTD=discovered Billie Holiday, had an ear for sacred music.  \nIn the
EXTD=1938-39 season, he staged two "From Spirituals to Swing" concert
EXTD=s that brought \ngreat recognition to the gospel idiom and introd
EXTD=uced it to the Hall's urbane audience.  Over \nthe years, the hal
EXTD=l's gospel alumni club has included Mahalia Jackson, who first he
EXTD=adlined \nthere in 1950, the a cappella group Sweet Honey in the 
EXTD=Rock, and gospel godfather \nAndrae Crouch.\n\nOne rarely thinks 
EXTD=of gospel music and jazz in the same breath, but there have been 
EXTD=some \nsublime collaborations of the two at Carnegie Hall.  In Ja
EXTD=nuary 1943, bandleader Duke \nEllington debuted his ambitious jaz
EXTD=z suite, "Black, Brown and Beige" at the hall.  Out of \nthat Sui
EXTD=te came the majestic piece, "Come Sunday."  Included here is the 
EXTD=1958 re-creation \nof the song with the Duke conducting and Mahal
EXTD=ia Jackson singing.  Another monumental \nunion showcased here is
EXTD=that of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and soprano Kathleen Battle \n
EXTD=on Handel's beloved aria of "Let The Bright Seraphim" from his sa
EXTD=cred oratorio "Samson."\n\nIn many ways, jazz is America's classi
EXTD=cal music and contained within this set are two \ntrumpet masterp
EXTD=ieces by jazz virtuosos Miles Davis on "So What?" (from his "Kind
EXTD=of Blue" \nmasterpiece) and Dizzy Gillespie's hypnotic "Night In
EXTD=Tunisia."  First Lady of Song Ella \nFitzgerald rounds out the j
EXTD=azz set with her trademark tune "A-Tisket A-Tasket."\n\nCarnegie 
EXTD=Hall has hosted the leading pop artists too.  Although he had bee
EXTD=n a star since \n"Chances Are" shot to No. 1 on the pop charts in
EXTD=1957, Johnny Mathis did not perform at \nCarnegie Hall until Oct
EXTD=ober 1993.  One of the songs he sang that evening was the dreamy 
EXTD=\n"99 Miles from L.A."  A song that Nancy Wilson has sung at ever
EXTD=y one of her Carnegie \nHall performances is her 1960 signature t
EXTD=une "Guess Who I Saw Today," while Calypso \nKing Harry Belafonte
EXTD=always garners a standing ovation with his 1954 hit "Matilda," a
EXTD=\nshowstopper in which a man sings about a woman who flees to Ve
EXTD=nezuela with his last \n$500 and his heart.\n\nSoul music has als
EXTD=o found a friend in Carnegie.  Bill Withers recorded a stellar li
EXTD=ve album \nthere in 1972.  Included here is his amorous hymn "Ain
EXTD='t No Sunshine."  The original \nrecording budget for it was so s
EXTD=mall that Withers joked to popmatters.com that producer \nBooker 
EXTD=T. Jones put the album together with "chewing gum and Scotch tape

EXTD=Nina Simone, who is featured here on Billy Taylor's \ncivil righ

EXTD=wingly, Simone summed up the meaning of "Honor!" when discussing 
EXTD=her own \nmusic with author Phyl Garland in 1969.  "There's no ot

EXTD=the times, the situations around us and the things \nwe're able t
EXTD=o say through our art, the things that millions of people can't s

EXTD=of course, those of us who are lucky leave a \nlegacy so that whe
