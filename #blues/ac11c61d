EXTD=The Complete Specialty Recordings Of Sam Cooke With The Soul Stir
EXTD=rers \n- Disc 1 of 3\n2002 Specialty Records, Inc.\n\nOriginally 
EXTD=Released October 15, 2002\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: They were known a
EXTD=s the Soul Stirrers when they did \nthe 1951-1957 recordings on t
EXTD=his three-CD, 84-song collection. It's billed \nto Sam Cooke with
EXTD=the Soul Stirrers, though, as it's the ultimate collection \nof 
EXTD=sides he recorded as a member of the group for Specialty Records,
EXTD=along \nwith seven tentative secular pop/rock sides he did for t
EXTD=he label as a \nsolo singer in 1956. Cooke doesn't sing lead on a
EXTD=ll of the Soul Stirrers' \ntracks, though there are plenty of his
EXTD=leads to hear throughout the set - \nhe shares lead duties with P
EXTD=aul Foster, although by the end of his time \nin the outfit, Cook
EXTD=e was taking most of the solo leads. There's also one \ncut, "All
EXTD=Right Now," on which Cooke shares lead with Rev. Julius Cheeks \n
EXTD=(two alternate versions of the song are also on the set). Even if
EXTD=Cooke \nisn't always the solo lead, however, he's a big presence
EXTD=on all of these \nsides, which represent both an important summa
EXTD=ry of his career prior to \nachieving pop stardom and a major bod
EXTD=y of gospel music. While much of \nthe material is traditional (w
EXTD=ith Cooke contributing some originals), \nthe arrangements do evo
EXTD=lve, including some drums, organ, piano, bass, \nand electric gui
EXTD=tar at various points. The link between gospel, R&B, and \nrock &
EXTD=roll becomes evident to more secular-minded listeners, sometimes
EXTD=\nstrikingly so in Cooke's phrasing, which, even on songs as far
EXTD=back as \n1953 ("I'd Give up All My Sins and Serve the Lord"), c
EXTD=ontained clear antecedents \nto his vocals on his first breakthro
EXTD=ugh pop hit, "You Send Me." Naturally \nthose antecedents are hea
EXTD=rd strongest on the seven 1956 solo cuts that \nrepresented his f
EXTD=irst pop ventures, and although these are on the innocuous \nside
EXTD=, they're enjoyable foreshadowings of his rock and roll years. Nume
EXTD=rous \nalternate takes and three 1955 live songs (with good sound
EXTD=) complete the \nmost comprehensive portrait of Cooke's gospel ye
EXTD=ars. Note, though, that \nthe version of "I'll Come Running Back 
EXTD=to You" -- a Top 20 entry in the \nwake of "You Send Me" -- lacks
