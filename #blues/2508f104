EXTD=AMG EXPERT REVIEW: Though Booker T. and the MG's had always been mo

EXTD=endary Stax studios. Most of the songs are arranged in a fluidmed

EXTD=, if you will, the sort of tunes you might have heard piped into 
EXTD=the Stax offices or renditions offered up by a late-night lounge 
EXTD=act. Following the introductory pairing of "Golden Slumbers"and "
EXTD=Carry That Weight," the quartet flexes its combined muscle on "Th
EXTD=e End," a performance complete with soloing from Cropper andheate
EXTD=d organ bursts from Jones. It's all over far too quickly, however

EXTD=and "Here Comes the Sun" with the tougher grooves of "TheEnd" and
EXTD="Come Together": songs that lend themselves much betterto the MG
EXTD='s' approach. The quartet may have been better off stretching out
EXTD=on a few of these tracks, rather than rendering the bulk of the 
EXTD=album. As it is, McLemore Avenue remains a curio for Booker T. an

EXTD=Francisco, CA USA) \nThis is an oddball, clearly a product of the
