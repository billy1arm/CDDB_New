EXTD=, 1993\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: Rather than aping the grandiose rock
EXTD=and roll style pioneered by Jim Steinman and Todd Rundgren on Meat
EXTD=Loaf's landmark Bat out of Hell album, German producer Frank Far
EXTD=ian opts for a standard-issue heavy metal approach on Blind Befor
EXTD=e I Stop, emphasizing a heart-stoppingly loud rhythm section (som
EXTD=etimes playing at Eurodisco tempo), icy keyboards in the mid-rang
EXTD=e, and endlessly diddling high-pitched guitar solos on a series o
EXTD=f forgettable tunes. Somewhere in the back of the mix, Meat Loaf 
EXTD=exercises his adenoids, but all of his usual distinctiveness is l
EXTD=ost in the sludge.  -- William Ruhlmann\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER RE
EXTD=VIEW\nI'll go Blind before I stop enjoying this..., April 12, 200
EXTD=4\nReviewer: Braeden P. Jeffery (Melbourne, VIC Aus]\nI know a lo
EXTD=t of people hate this album, but I can't seem to bring myself to 
EXTD=do the same. I got it relatively recently (compared to much of my
EXTD=Meat Loaf collection) and there's certainly something about it t
EXTD=hat's infectious and enjoyable.\nThough it was ill recieved in th
EXTD=e US (and, surprisingly, the UK) this is still one of Meat's fine
EXTD=r moments and includes some real classics. A surprising amount of
EXTD=singles were lifted, beginning with the pre-release "Rock and Ro
EXTD=ll Mercenaries". This stunning duet with British rocker John Parr
EXTD=is the standout of the album, and in fact settles itself as one 
EXTD=of the best tracks of Meat's career.\n\nOther top tracks include 
EXTD="Execution Day", which completely blew me away with it's dark und
EXTD=ertones and incredible guitar riffs - "One More Kiss", a Meat Loaf
EXTD=/John Golden collaboration with some surprisingly beautiful lyric
EXTD=s, considering the song content - "Standing On The Outside", which
EXTD=surprised me somewhat by being a perfect mix of soft-rock music 
EXTD=and lyrics - and of course, "Blind Before I Stop" itself, which is
EXTD=a fast-paced rocker.\n\nI think that "Blind" is hugely underrate
EXTD=d because of a few bad songs. Judging this LP on the basis of son
EXTD=gs like "Burning Down", "Special Girl" and (in my opinion) "Rock 
EXTD=n' Roll Hero" is being to harsh. Though the latter half of the al
EXTD=bum suffers, the majority is top class, and no Meat Loaf collecti
EXTD=on should be without it.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nStop Befo
EXTD=re I'm Deaf!, October 29, 2003\nReviewer: Kevin Stafford (Warwick
EXTD=, RI]\nI have every Meatloaf CD including this sad effort. There 
EXTD=are NO stand out tracks on this CD and I LOVE Meatloaf. It's seem
EXTD=s that Marvin tried to sound too much like the era music and that
EXTD='s not what he is loved for. Proof positive on the less thatn slt
EXTD=ellar writing of this album is the exclusion of any of these song
EXTD=s on his "Very Best Of.." CD. Buy any other Meatloaf Cd, just not
EXTD=this one! His latest to date "Couldn't Have Said It Better" is a
EXTD=masterpeice and without the help of Jim writing the songs! I am 
EXTD=here to review this CD though. His only album on Atlantic Records
EXTD=and I wonder why they never let him do another? Hmm..\n\nMeatloa
EXTD=f is one of the most underrated Rock and Roll gems but this album
EXTD=is a poor example of that. Try "Bad Attitude" or "Dead Ringer" i
EXTD=f your looking for the more unknown Meatloaf. Even "Midnight at t
EXTD=he Lost And Found" Is better. His best are "Bat Of Ouf Hell", "Ba
EXTD=t Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell", "Welcome To The Neighborhood" 
EXTD=and his latest I already mentioned.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW
EXTD=\nThe forgotten Meat album that SHOULD'VE been a hit, March 24, 2
EXTD=003\nReviewer: Justin Dillihay "darkpowrjd" (Ohio]\nMeat has had 
EXTD=his share of ups and down, from one of the best selling albums EV
EXTD=ER, Bat Out Of Hell, to his "worst" album which marks the most un
EXTD=derrated Meat effort EVER, Midnight At The Lost And Found (why no
EXTD=one like it, I'll never know). Then, after Meat knew about the U
EXTD=K loving him to death, he decided to cater more to them and relea
EXTD=sed Bad Attitude, which was received VERY well there and exceptio
EXTD=nally well here. Meat then needed a follow up to Bad Attitude. En
EXTD=ter Blind Before I Stop.\nBlind continues where Bad Attitude leav
EXTD=es off, and this is probably what Attitude would've had if it was
EXTD=allowed to have 11 more tracks to it, as it continues with the 8
EXTD=0's-style euro-pop sound. It didn't do well here, but one has to 
EXTD=wonder why it didn't once listening to it, as it was the most for
EXTD=gotten Meat successes. Although this album didn't get received we
EXTD=ll here, the UK showed us that they have better tastes in music t
EXTD=han us.\n\nThe album starts up with the excellent Execution Day, 
EXTD=and with the rock ballad that Meat gives here, it's hard to not l
EXTD=isten to it. Excellent lyrics and a great guitar riff does it jus
EXTD=tice.\n\nRock N' Roll Mercenaries is EASILY the best track on thi
EXTD=s CD, and one of the better Meat duets that he as done. British r
EXTD=ocker John Parr helps Meat out on this one, and he sounds as good
EXTD=as ever here. There are lyrics that tell a lot about the music i
EXTD=ndustry as of late, and they tell their case perfectly, and the q
EXTD=uote "Money is power, and power is fame," is one of the best I've
EXTD=heard in a long time. If for nothing else, get this CD just for 
EXTD=this track. \n\nAs well as for the highlight track, Getting Away 
EXTD=With Murder. This is the only single that came off of Blind, and 
EXTD=it's a wonder why neither Murder nor Mercenaries made it onto the
EXTD=Very Best Of CD. Murder tells of a guy who's juggling two lovers
EXTD=, trying to love them both. It's also one of Meat's better vocal 
EXTD=attempts, and the lyrics tell the story very well.\n\nOne More Ki
EXTD=ss is taking a bit from Paradise By The Dashboard Light, being cu
EXTD=t into three separate parts. It goes into a soft rock ballad, to 
EXTD=a hard rock one, then back again. It's a unique sound, and good d
EXTD=isplay of creativity.\n\nBlind Before I Stop is a very good hard 
EXTD=rock song that got overlooked. Meat's basically saying how much h
EXTD=e wants to dance (that would be interesting to see. Meat dancing)
EXTD=It's cool, and easy to get down to.\n\nBurning Down is a bad so
EXTD=ng, but you may not care, since it's one of those bad songs that 
EXTD=you sing along with anyway, because it still has a pretty good ri
EXTD=ng to it, and the riffs are perfect.\n\nStanding On The Outside i
EXTD=s an EXCELLENT soft rock song, and one of my favorites. Meat is a
EXTD=t his best when he goes soft, and this is a highlight of that res
EXTD=pect. I don't know why this one wasn't a hit, because it needed t
EXTD=o be. It's one of Meat's better songs of his career.\n\nMasculine
EXTD=is slightly humorous by it's chorus and some of it's other lyric
EXTD=s, and the riffs are decent to accommodate those lyrics, but what
EXTD=was with that answering machine message at the beginning of this
EXTD=one? Made no sense to have it in there, as it didn't have a plac
EXTD=e with the rest of the song.\n\nA Man And A Woman is a good balla
EXTD=d, but failed to capture what Standing On The Outside did before.
EXTD=Still, even when compared with that excellent track, this one st
EXTD=ands firm. \n\nSpecial Girl is the only slightly redundant song o
EXTD=n the CD. It doesn't really succeed in making you get into the so
EXTD=ng much, and it's a disappointment, because it could've been bett
EXTD=er.\n\nRock And Roll Hero is one of the best closers to a Meat CD
EXTD=I have EVER heard yet. Although just slightly edged by Rock N Ro
EXTD=ll Mercenaries as the best song on the CD and one of the best one
EXTD=s in his career, Hero is easily a track that should be responsibl
EXTD=e in you getting this CD. Meat rocks hard here, and really let's 
EXTD=you know the reason for this CD.\n\nIt's hard to really see a bad
EXTD=Meat CD, since his worst is EASILY better than some best efforts
EXTD=of some artists these days. Meat's worst albums are still great,
EXTD=and this one is VERY overlooked (not as much as Midnight was, bu
EXTD=t it comes close). If you need more convincing in getting this CD
EXTD=, two of the songs from this one (the two I said should've been o
EXTD=n Meat's Very Best Of CD) appeared on the import greatest hits al
EXTD=bum Prime Cuts.\n\nI recommend this CD for anyone who likes to he
EXTD=ar just Meat being Meat. This is proof that the UK knows a lot mo
EXTD=re about good music than the US could ever know.\n\nAMAZON.COM CU

EXTD=ch of a 'Bad Attitude', July 5, 1999\nReviewer: A music fan\nMeat
EXTD=Loaf seems to have trouble following up his great albums. Such i
EXTD=s the case with Blind Before I Stop, the album after the 'comebac
EXTD=k' Bad Attitude which was suprisingly good, considering Steinman'
EXTD=s absence from the studio. Blind Before I Stop departs from the p
EXTD=seudo-Steinman bombast Bad Attitude ventured into, and heads down
EXTD=the road of 80's metal. Not to knock 80's metal but this is not 
EXTD=Meat Loaf's style. The album really shines in some points, though
EXTD=, Execution Day, the opener, is easily Meat's best non-Steinman p
EXTD=enned song. The title track delivers great basic 80's rock at a t
EXTD=empo most bands didn't attempt, Rock and Roll Mercenaries was a m
EXTD=oderate hit in the UK, and One More Kiss is an attempt to recreat
EXTD=e Steinman's varying, unpredictable style, going from ballad to r
EXTD=ocker to ballad again. The trouble is, those tracks are 4 of the 
EXTD=first 5 on the album. After the title track (5) the only song wor
EXTD=th hearing is the slightly humorus Masculine. The rest is a poor 
EXTD=attempt by Meat and Frank Farian, later of Milli Vanilli fame, to
EXTD=be contemporary, with songs like 'Special Girl' making me want t
EXTD=o wretch. This album isn't essential unless you like paying full 
EXTD=price for an album that's half good, half crap. Thankfully, Meat 
EXTD=would finally realize his mistake and reunite with Jim Steinman a
EXTD=fter this effort.\n\nHalf.com Album Notes\nThe mid-1980s spelled 
EXTD=doom for most champions of '70s pomp rock, as MTV and radio fans 
EXTD=seemed to be mesmerized by concise, synth-based pop ditties. Perh
EXTD=aps sensing that his sound had become passe, Meat Loaf attempted 
EXTD=to keep pace with the current pop scene for his fifth solo album,
EXTD=1986's BLIND BEFORE I STOP. He enlisted the services of Euro-dan
EXTD=ce king Frank Farian (whose name would be tossed around in the ta
EXTD=bloids years later due to his involvement in the Milli Vanilli sc
EXTD=andal). Farian lets Meat Loaf rock out on a few tracks, but also 
EXTD=helps him experiment with dance sounds, something that most longt
EXTD=ime Meat Loaf fans weren't exactly expecting.\nThe self-explanato
EXTD=ry "Rock N' Roll Mercenaries" is a pure-blooded rocker, but selec
EXTD=tions such as the title track are a good example of Farian's newl
EXTD=y proposed dance direction. BLIND BEFORE I STOP failed to reach t
EXTD=he top of the charts in Europe (where Meat Loaf remained a hot co
EXTD=mmodity), proving that his new direction wasn't the answer to his
EXTD=problems. Meat Loaf wouldn't release another new studio album fo
EXTD=r seven years (until his 1993 worldwide comeback smash BAT OUT OF
EXTD=HELL II), concentrating instead on road work.\n\nIndustry Review
