EXTD=in a style of sultry soul that Green inherited from Cooke. \n\nYet, Green's style owed as much to producer Willie Mitchell's delicate production as it did to the singer's pure falsetto. While not inclined to use the vast numbers of musicians that Phi

EXTD=cally, listening to GREATEST HITS is like thumbing through a primer on the evolution of a relationship, and the ups and downs that come with it. The despair of "Tired Of Being Alone" gives way to a fleeting affair in "Call Me (Come Back Home)." The j
EXTD=oy Green finds in "Love And Happiness" is temporary before the pleading begins anew with "Let's Stay Together," then gets tied up with a declaration ("L-O-V-E (Love)") and a proposal ("Let's Get Married"). \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nWoefully I
