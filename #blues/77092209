EXTD=EXPERT REVIEW:  Starting in 1971 with Al Green Gets Next to You,
EXTD=Al Green albums became necessities. Livin' for You is Green's si
EXTD=xth album, and the fourth to be certified gold. (Its predecessor,
EXTD=the classic Call Me, was still on the charts when this was relea
EXTD=sed.) Each of Green's albums with Willie Mitchell are singular, w
EXTD=ith their own distinct style, and Livin' for You is no exception.
EXTD=It takes a more relaxed approach and offers some of his best bal
EXTD=lads - the title track is Green at his most engaging, even when he
EXTD=sang potentially mood-interrupting lines like "I'm tired of your
EXTD=bright ideas about leaving me." "Home Again" and "So Good to Be 
EXTD=Here" are romantic if not hypnotic, offering subtle drumming, eco
EXTD=nomical keyboards, and gentle vocals. The biggest track here, the
EXTD=proficient and smooth "Let's Get Married," has Green being a lit
EXTD=tle wishy-washy as he sings, "I didn't mean to say all the things
EXTD=I said/The way I felt in my heart it came out that way." Althoug
EXTD=h the originals here rank with his best, Green also did good cove
EXTD=r work too. The often useless "Unchained Melody" shows up and ben
EXTD=efits from Green's methodical delivery. In many ways, Livin' for 
EXTD=You is the perfect, intimate album for his fans.  -- Jason Elias\n
