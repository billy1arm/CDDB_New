EXTD=what's wrong? Well, I'm surethat many collectors miss the in-depth booklets from the 1997 reissues with a comprehensive and lucid soundtrack annotation and full-colour photo stills from the three films. This would mean thatthose who listen to the mu
EXTD=sic might not be able to follow what happens. At least the music is presented in chronological order, which is a tremendous asset. In its place we get a fold-out posterfor a CD insert, which is in itself as useless as the 3-D covers. Also, the Enhanc
EXTD=ed CD features are perhaps junk, because the screensavers and book covers are not entirely necessary on soundtrack reissues. They are merely a marketing gimmick so that fans canspend more money, despite the fan requests. But even though these two gri

EXTD=4.) A Boxset combining the soundtracks of the classic Star Wars Trilogy.In 1977, George Lucas took the world by storm with A New Hope, the first film in the Star Wars series. The film became known as a science fiction masterpiece in a relatively shor

EXTD=e, if you're a fan of the Star Wars movies, the soundtracks are an essential purchase. Whenthe soundtracks were rereleased on CD in 1997 and again in 2004,the tracklists were upgraded over the original vinyl versions. Each of the soundtracks from the
EXTD=classic trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi) is now a dual-disc set, which features every piece of music from the entire film it represents, from start to finish. Hell, they've even got the TwentiethCentury Fox Fanfare i
EXTD=ntro! Each soundtrack has the complete musical score from its respective film, in the order each piece appeared in the film. Furthermore, each soundtrack adds an alternate version bonus track. Even further adding to the greatness is that many of the 
EXTD=pieces of music are the full-length complete versions.Because of this, you get the complete piece of music, meaning you'll even hear portions of some pieces that didn't even appear inthe films (because the versions in the films were cut short in some
EXTD=cases.) My lone complaint is that some songs that should havebeen divided into separate tracks weren't (for instance, on eachsoundtrack, the opening theme fades right into the first uniquepiece of music to eachfilm, and it's ALL ONE TRACK, meaning y
EXTD=oucan't skip right past the inro to the first unique piece of music. On the flip side, the end credits are directly connected to theLAST unique piece of music from each film, meaning you can't skip directly tothe end credit theme (and this is sure to
EXTD=disappoint some listeners.)) Despite that little flaw, these are still great soundtracks. Every piece of music on here is excellent, proving John Williams to be one of the greatest composers who ever lived.The soundtracks not only show off his music
EXTD=al ability, but also his diversity musically. To put it simply, if you liked the movies, the soundtracks are an essential buy. The soundtracks got rereleased in 2004, obviously to cash in on the rerelease of the classic trilogy of films on DVD. In ad
EXTD=dition to remastering thesound and revamping the cover art of the soundtrack CDs, the record company gives this alternative option - the box set of all three soundtracks from the classic trilogy. If you purchase the boxset, you'll save a few bucks, s
EXTD=o I recommend getting it rather than buying them separately. If you liked the classic Star Wars Trilogy (and honestly, who didn't?), the soundtracks are well worth adding to your CD collection. Whenever John Williams does the music for a film, his sc
EXTD=ore NEVER fails to please - and his abilities aren't limited to just the Star Wars series. I also strongly recommend the soundtracks to any other films he has scored. For all you classic Star Wars fans - the soundtracks are essentialpurchases.AMAZON.
