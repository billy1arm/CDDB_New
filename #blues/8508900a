EXTD=As such, it is difficult to avoid comparisons with their landmark debut. Third Stage has some strong moments, especially the number one hit "Amanda" where the band blends acoustic and electric guitars to complement the layered vocals. However, the

EXTD=ebut. -- Vik Iyengar\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\n4.5 stars - Boston's comeback, March 25, 2005 \nReviewer: Darth Kommissar (Las Vegas, NV (USA)]\nIn the mid-late seventies, Boston fast became one of the most popular classic rock groups of the day.
EXTD=Their 1976 debut album held the record for the best-selling debut album of all time (the record wouldn't be broken for many years), and their follow-up album, 1978's Don't Look Back, was also well-received. And then, Boston faded away. The musical m
EXTD=astery of guitar genius Tom Scholz and the awesome vocals of Brad Delp became forgotten, amidst a sea of hair metal and new wave. The fact that they hadn't released an album in years didn't help things either. But little did people know, the band was
EXTD=working on a new record. By the time Third Stage hit stores in 1986, it was a project EIGHT YEARS in the making. Many legal issues, as well as Tom Scholz's perfectionistic production style, caused the delay. How does the band's comeback measure up? 
EXTD=Read on for my review of Third Stage. \n\nUltimately, Third Stage was a good album. The band's third record features that forgotten classic rock sound they had used earlier, but at the same time throws just enough new elements into the mix that it so
EXTD=unded fresh, even in the eighties when bands were attempting innovations around every corner. The band scored a huge charting hit with the classic Amanda. The song continues to get plenty of classic rock airplay, even to this day, and it remains this
EXTD=album's most popular song. But like with most albums, there are a plethora of underrated songs that are not to be missed. The classic power rock of songs like We're Ready and Cool The Engines will certainly appeal to those who enjoyed the group's cl
EXTD=assic albums. There are also some excellent, melodic rockers, including Hollyann and Can'tcha See - both of which are excellent songs that never got the proper credit. Admittingly, I don't particuarly think this album was worth an eight year weight (
EXTD=that's not to say it's not a good album), but most of that weight was due to legal troubles, so I can't really blame the band there. This isn't my favorite Boston album (I'll always like the debut best), but it's very close to the top. No fan of the 
EXTD=group should be without it. \n\nBoston's albums really need to be remastered and rereleased. They were only released on CD once, and these older issues are fading away and becoming tough to find in stores. Only the band's greatest hits compilation se

EXTD=c producer (one of the big delay-causers between Boston albums), but ultimately his taking so long to produce this one paid off - it sounds great. Following 1978, an unofficial Boston tradition started - ten years between each studio album. This mean
EXTD=t that they didn't release a follow-up to Third Stage until 1994! This means Boston albums are a rarity, but when they come out, they're great (most of them.) New to the band? Start with the band's self-titled debut and get every album in order (they
EXTD=don't have many albums, so it's worth it to buy them all.) Third Stage is a great addition to the catalogue, but newbies should start at the beginning.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nGuilty pleasure, October 31, 2000 \nReviewer: Brian Rubendall (Oak
EXTD=ton, VA) \nBy the mid 1980s, most of the 70s arena rock bands (Foreigner, Journey, Styx, Kansas, etc.) had called it a day. Then along comes Boston's ever unpredictable Tom Shultz to reemerge from wilderness with his band's third album to breathe a l

EXTD=Synthesised sounds are all over this record from start to finish. Tom made his guitar sound like a frigging violin for gods sake. And he thinks thats not a synthesised sound? \n\nNow, on to the music. If you've worn out your copy of "Don't Look Bac
EXTD=k" or the debut, Third Stage is practically interchangable with those two records - multi octave tenor vocals, layers of heavilly reverbed guitars, and lots of fancy studio wizardry all around. \n\nAnd lets not forget the incredible amount of synthesi
EXTD=sers Mr. Scholz used. Sure he SAYS there were no synthesisers used, but we all know better than that. This record is LOADED with synthesised sounds. When the listener hears a violin that is actually a guitar, than that is a synthesised sound, weather
EXTD=Tom wants to admit it or not. So yes Tom, your record DOES use synthesisers. Only in your case they're modified guitars as opposed to keyboards.\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nNot The Old Boston - 2.5 stars, July 14, 2005 \nReviewer: New Kiddintoun 
EXTD=(Someplace Elsewhere]\nNOTICE: If you do not have this record, do not buy it without finishing reading this review. \n\nTHIRD STAGE is not near as good a record as the band's previous two (DON'T LOOK BACK and BOSTON). The main reason for this is more
EXTD=than likely that the band is gone. Brad Delp (mainly lead and harmony vocals) and Tom Scholtz (mainly guitar) were the only band members left at that point, leaving Boston in a dark spot - Tom Scholtz covered most of the music (shining a light on his
EXTD=almost overly-apparent talent), but he overdid it - far too many overdubs (even for Boston) were added, and more than 80% of the record's drums are recreated through keyboards (drum simulators, if you may). There is hardly any natural sound - the aco
EXTD=ustic twelve-string guitars are essential to the album. Without them, this album would be blow-dried, air-conditioned claustrophobia wrapped into a circle.......in other words, a record. \n\nTHIRD STAGE gets an overall 3 stars from me, the result of 
EXTD=disappointment and a reverse effect: certain things can 'grow on you' over time, but this seemed to 'grow off me' over time. It might seem great when you buy it, but that will change. \n\nDO NOT EXPECT THE BOSTON FROM THE 70'S - YOUR EXPECTATIONS WIL

EXTD=k. \n\nBased on the perfectionist ways of Tom Scholz's production and guitar skills, and the multi-layered harmonies of Brad Delp's soaring vocals, Boston had come virtually out of no where in 1976 to define a genre- AOR- with one of the biggest-sell

EXTD=lodic guitar-based music is what you want to call faceless and corporate, fine. Just because it wasn't punk, California soft rock, singer/songwriter or New Wave doesn't mean it was invalid. \n\nFollowed up in 1978 by the rushed if still attractiv Don
EXTD='t Look Back- an album that honorably aped their debut- Boston toured into 1979 then took a break. \n\n1980 saw the release of guitarist Barry Goudreau's solo album which was really a Boston album in all but name, lacking only Sholz's production and

EXTD=ngines are good rockers with rocket ride imagery - I Think I Like It and #20 Cantcha Say are decent pop rock - and Holly Ann is a wistful, nostalgic look back for Scholz to his youth in the peace and love 60s. \n\nBut this album is not without its flaw
EXTD=s. As other reviewers have mentioned, this (and the first 2 albums as well) really needs a remaster. I would also do a re-mix. The production is a victim of its mid-80s vintage as well as Scholz's blind faith in 80s technology. The sound is a bit col
EXTD=d, drenched in echo. Even if the debut album itself has a certain sterile perfection, it still sounds much warmer than Third Stage. The 80s electronic drums should be replaced by the real deal. And Brad Delp's voice should be brought more to the fore
EXTD=The liner notes should also be updated, and maybe some unreleased tracks added. \n\nLead by the Amanda single, Third Stage shot to number one and sold millions, and Boston would go on an extremely succesful arena tour with only Delp and Scholz left
EXTD=from the original band. I had the pleasure of seeing them on their home turf in 1988 at a benefit show at the old Boston Garden, and it was a blast. Even got to meet Brad and Tom by the artist entrance in the back of the Garden after the show, and t
EXTD=hey were really cool. As a 19 year old college sophomore heavily into classic rock and WZLX at the time, it blew my mind to actually stand face-to-face and meet the guys behind this great music. Boston, thanks for the memories!\n\nAmazon.com Customer
EXTD=Review\nIt took 6 years to write the same song twice?!?, April 22, 2005\nReviewer: Greg Brady "columbusboy" (Capital City) \nThe worst tragedy of this album isn't so much that it's resolutely awful. I've certainly heard worse albums. It's that clear
EXTD=ly Tom Scholz believes he's made a significant artistic statement. \n\nHe proudly boasts (twice!) that "it took nearly six years to conceive and complete this album" (in his home studio in his garage). He spends a full page of the liners explaining e
EXTD=xactly how it was recorded (all-analog), with what instruments (he goes so far as to tell you type of pickup on the guitars), what effects ("No those aren't violins, they're electric guitars through a Rockman") and when he wrote them (he was scroungi

EXTD=cked up with great art, but that's in little evidence here. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: \n"Amanda", the album's only hit, was a deserved one. It's a catchy well-produced hummable ballad. Outside of that, the only other one that really made me take notice was roc
EXTD=ker "Cool the Engines". \n\nLOWS: \n"My Destination" is completely derivative of "Amanda". Compare them and tell me they're not the same song with different lyrics. (And you can't get away with telling me it's a "reprise" as part of a concept album. 
EXTD=You don't change lyrics on a reprise. This is Scholz trying to pull a fast one.) "The Launch" was an overblown attempt at creating the sound of a "liftoff" as a pre-amble to "Cool the Engines". It doesn't work. It's nowhere near as great a lead-in as
EXTD="Foreplay" was for "Long Time". "Hollyann" is a self-congratulatory backslap to aging hippies.("Hollyann/We made the dark into the light/We saw the wrong and the right/We were for life/And we would never concede it") It leaves a bad taste in your mo
EXTD=uth. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: \nThe songs are mostly faceless. I hope during the 6 years Scholz spent in the garage he was able to find time to tuneup the vehicles and clean up the room in general. If not, he pretty much has nothing to show for all that time
EXTD=\n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\nScholz's Last Masterpiece, November 5, 2004\nReviewer: Gregory S. Standard (Manassas, Va United States]\nMost Boston fans would agree that Scholz takes much too long to put out an album - 8 years on average. However, 
EXTD=if it were not for this fact, Boston's Third Stage (released in 1986) would probably not have been the great album that it is. Here's my reasoning: \n\nTom Scholz's song writing ability was probably depleted by the beginning of the 1980's. Most of th
EXTD=e songs on the Third Stage album were conceived of during Tom's "period of creativity", which spanned the entire decade of the 70's. For example, Amanda was really an old song, first conceived of in late 1978. Likewise, most of the songs from the deb
EXTD=ut album were written years before their release date as well. \n\nTherefore, although the album was a "modern" 1986 work of art, it still sounded a lot like the "old" Boston of the 70's. The only thing that changed at all was the electronic tone of 
EXTD=Tom's guitar (still the best sound in electric guitar history). Of course, we'll ignore the fact that the only other original member of the band that was left was Brad Delp. \n\nSo, what we have are old songs that took eight years to record. This is 
EXTD=a good thing, because once Scholz starting writing material in the mid 1980's, it is clear that he had tapped out his well of musical creativity. \n\nJust look at the Walk On CD (his last gasp) and the latest Corporate America CD (mostly written by o
EXTD=ther people). \n\nI look at Third Stage as the final sequel to a great Trilogy. Good things seem to come in threes. \n\nIt's a shame it had to end there, even though Scholz's "Boston" is still alive and kicking. \n\nI guess original members like guit
