EXTD=zing piece of work -- a massive eight-disc boxed set that contain
EXTD=s every one of Fats Domino's 1949-1962 Imperial waxings. That's a
EXTD=tremendous load of one artist, but the legacy of Domino and his 
EXTD=partner Dave Bartholomew is so consistently innovative and infect
EXTD=ious that it never grows tiresome for a second. From the clarion 
EXTD=call of "The Fat Man," Domino's 1949 debut, to the storming "Danc
EXTD=e with Mr. Domino" in 1962, he typified everything charming about
EXTD=Crescent City R&B, his Creole patois and boogie-based piano a no
EXTD=n-threatening vehicle for the rise of rock and roll. A thick, photo
EXTD=filled book accompanies the disc, and there's an exhaustive disc
EXTD=ography that makes sense of Domino's many visits to Cosimo Matass
EXTD=a's studios. If you care about Fats Domino, this is the package t
