EXTT0=Lightnin' Hopkins \n\nAKA  Sam Hopkins \nBorn  Mar 15, 1912 in Centervill
EXTT0=e, TX \nDied  Jan 30, 1982 in Houston, TX \n\nwas a Texas country bluesma
EXTT0=n of the highest caliber whose career began in the 1920s and stretched al
EXTT0=l the way into the 1980s. Along the way, Hopkins watched the genre change
EXTT0=remarkably, but he never appreciably altered his mournful Lone Star soun
EXTT0=d, which translated onto both acoustic and electric guitar. Hopkins' nimb
EXTT0=le dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy, and his fascinating p
EXTT0=enchant for improvising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made
EXTT0=him a beloved blues troubadour.\nHopkins' brothers John Henry and Joel w
EXTT0=ere also talented bluesmen, but it was Sam who became a star. In 1920, he
EXTT0=met the legendary Blind Lemon Jefferson at a social function, and even g
EXTT0=ot a chance to play with him. Later, Hopkins served as Jefferson's guide.
EXTT0=In his teens, Hopkins began working with another pre-war great, singer T
EXTT0=exas Alexander, who was his cousin. A mid-'30s stretch in Houston's Count
EXTT0=y Prison Farm for the young guitarist interrupted their partnership for a
EXTT0=time, but when he was freed, Hopkins hooked back up with the older blues
EXTT0=man.\n\nThe pair was dishing out their lowdown brand of blues in Houston'
EXTT0=s Third Ward in 1946 when talent scout Lola Anne Cullum came across them.
EXTT0=She had already engineered a pact with Los Angeles-based Aladdin Records
EXTT0=for another of her charges, pianist Amos Milburn, and Cullum saw the sam
EXTT0=e sort of opportunity within Hopkins' dusty country blues. Alexander wasn
EXTT0='t part of the deal - instead, Cullum paired Hopkins with pianist Wilson "
EXTT0=Thunder" Smith, sensibly re-christened the guitarist "Lightnin'," and pre
EXTT0=sto! Hopkins was very soon an Aladdin recording artist.\n\n"Katie May," c
EXTT0=ut on November 9, 1946, in L.A. with Smith lending a hand on the 88s, was
EXTT0=Lightnin' Hopkins' first regional seller of note. He recorded prolifical
EXTT0=ly for Aladdin in both L.A. and Houston into 1948, scoring a national R&B
EXTT0=hit for the firm with his "Shotgun Blues." "Short Haired Woman," "Abilen
EXTT0=e," and "Big Mama Jump," among many Aladdin gems, were evocative Texas bl
EXTT0=ues rooted in an earlier era.\n\nA load of other labels recorded the wily
EXTT0=Hopkins after that, both in a solo context and with a small rhythm secti
EXTT0=on: Modern/RPM (his uncompromising "Tim Moore's Farm" was an R&B hit in 1
EXTT0=949) - Gold Star (where he hit with "T-Model Blues" that same year) - Sitti
EXTT0=n' in With ("Give Me Central 209" and "Coffee Blues" were national chart 
EXTT0=entries in 1952) and its Jax subsidiary - the major labels Mercury and Dec
EXTT0=ca - and, in 1954, a remarkable batch of sides for Herald where Hopkins pl
EXTT0=ayed blistering electric guitar on a series of blasting rockers ("Lightni
EXTT0=n's Boogie," "Lightnin's Special," and the amazing "Hopkins' Sky Hop") in
EXTT0=front of drummer Ben Turner and bassist Donald Cooks (who must have had 
EXTT0=bleeding fingers, so torrid were some of the tempos).\n\nBut Hopkins' sty
EXTT0=le was apparently too rustic and old-fashioned for the new generation of 
EXTT0=rock and roll enthusiasts (they should have checked out "Hopkins' Sky Hop")
EXTT0=He was back on the Houston scene by 1959, largely forgotten. Fortunatel
EXTT0=y, folklorist Mack McCormick rediscovered the guitarist, who was dusted o
EXTT0=ff and presented as a folk-blues artist - a role that Hopkins was born to 
EXTT0=play. Pioneering musicologist Sam Charters produced Hopkins in a solo con
EXTT0=text for Folkways Records that same year, cutting an entire LP in Hopkins
EXTT0=' tiny apartment (on a borrowed guitar). The results helped introduced hi
EXTT0=s music to an entirely new audience.\n\nLightnin' Hopkins went from giggi
EXTT0=ng at back-alley gin joints to starring at collegiate coffeehouses, appea
EXTT0=ring on TV programs, and touring Europe to boot. His once-flagging record
EXTT0=ing career went right through the roof, with albums for World Pacific - Ve
EXTT0=e-Jay - Bluesville - Bobby Robinson's Fire label (where he cut his classic 
EXTT0="Mojo Hand" in 1960) - Candid - Arhoolie - Prestige - Verve - and, in 1965, th
EXTT0=e first of several LPs for Stan Lewis' Shreveport-based Jewel logo.\n\nHo
EXTT0=pkins generally demanded full payment before he'd deign to sit down and r
EXTT0=ecord, and seldom indulged a producer's desire for more than one take of 
EXTT0=any song. His singular sense of country time befuddled more than a few un
EXTT0=seasoned musicians - from the 1960s on, his solo work is usually preferabl
EXTT0=e to band-backed material.\n\nFilmmaker Les Blank captured the Texas trou
EXTT0=badour's informal lifestyle most vividly in his acclaimed 1967 documentar
EXTT0=y, The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins. As one of the last great cou
EXTT0=ntry bluesmen, Hopkins was a fascinating figure who bridged the gap betwe
EXTT0=en rural and urban styles. \n\nby Bill Dahl
