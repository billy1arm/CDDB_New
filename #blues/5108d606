EXTD=having the entire Tommy rock opera intact. While impressive, tha

EXTD=nto the second disc, "Shakin' All Over," "My Generation," and "Ma

EXTD=at the end of the entire show and relocated to the end of the fi
EXTD=rst (read: non-Tommy disc). Even though drastic improvements augm
EXTD=ented the 1995 release, time considerations meant that some ambie
EXTD=nce and stage dialogue between the band and the audience was stil
EXTD=l missing. With the expansion to a two-CD format, much of the pre
EXTD=viously edited material has been reinstated to reflect the actual
EXTD=pacing of the show more accurately. This new mix ... supervised 
EXTD=by Pete Townshend (guitar/vocal) ... is an all-encompassing stere
EXTD=oscape which has never felt more intimidating. Although no mentio
EXTD=n is made in the information- and memorabilia-laden 28-page liner
EXTD=notes booklet, vocalist Roger Daltrey performed several vocal ov
EXTD=erdubs during Tommy which are unique to this release. Although no
EXTD=t impossible to locate, they blend surprisingly well with a recor
EXTD=ding that is fairly old. Live at Leeds (Deluxe Edition) is a must

EXTD=nformation About 2001 Deluxe Edition\nAmazon.com Editorial Review
EXTD=\nLong considered one of the greatest live albums ever recorded, 
EXTD=the Who's Live at Leeds was originally edited and packaged to res
EXTD=emble the haphazard state of early-'70s bootlegs, then expanded a
EXTD=nd sonically upgraded in the mid-1990s. But this deluxe edition f
EXTD=inally restores the blistering February 1970 Leeds University con
EXTD=cert to its full running length by adding the band's earliest off
EXTD=icially available live rendition of the then-fresh Tommy in its e
EXTD=ntirety. And while it isn't perfect (the Tommy tracks have been m
EXTD=oved from their original slot in the show and resequenced to fit 
EXTD=onto disc 2 here), this album now takes its place as the best ava
EXTD=ilable document of the Who in their truly ferocious prime, trumpi
EXTD=ng the previously available Isle of Wight show (recorded some six
EXTD=months later) in both performance level and sound quality. It al
EXTD=so begs a little revisionist pondering: Are these the true godfat
EXTD=hers of punk? Pete Townshend's music and chord structures may hav
EXTD=e often been jazz-based, but they careen with an energy that seem
EXTD=s at once feral and superhuman. Roger Daltrey's vocals snarl with
EXTD=palpable grit, while the rhythm section of John Entwistle and Ke
EXTD=ith Moon thunders menacingly along like an overheated locomotive.
EXTD=The Tommy heard here is still vital and alive, played by a band 
EXTD=whose fervent, in-the-moment abandon is a wonder to behold. --Jer

EXTD=, September 24, 2001 \nReviewer: krkalino from Southwest Michigan
EXTD=\nWhat a let down! There is a good reason the Who never released
EXTD=the Tommy set performed at Leeds - It's simply substandard compa
EXTD=red to the rest of the material! Its unfortunate because the two 
EXTD=Tommy cuts available on the 95 remastered Leeds certainly fueled 
EXTD=the hunger for the whole set to be released. If you want a great 
EXTD=live performance of Tommy, pick up the Isle of Wight CD. That per
EXTD=formance of Tommy, done six months later is FAR superior. The sub
EXTD=telty and wit essential to pulling off a live performance of the 
EXTD=Who's rock opera seems to be lost in the Leeds bombast. The packa
EXTD=ging for the deluxe edition is horrendous as well. It is impossib
EXTD=le to not rip the corners of the cover when placing in the plasti
EXTD=c slip case. MCA should have included some new goodies inside as 
EXTD=well, but instead rehashed the same pictures and narrative of the
EXTD=95 CD. Don't waste big bucks on this set! Stick with the five st
EXTD=ar 95 Leeds remaster and pick up Isle of Wight (four and three qu
EXTD=arters stars!) while you're at it. \n\nAmazon.com Customer Review

EXTD=ng is, I'm not complaining. Sure, I would have liked to have the 
EXTD=complete concert when they expanded Leeds in '95, but I really en
EXTD=joyed that version. The improved sound was a revelation.\n\nThey 
EXTD=have certainly done a nice job on this Deluxe Edition. The sound 
EXTD=is, if anything, even better. Unbelievable. And I hardly notice t
EXTD=he spots where Daltry has overdubbed his voice. The thing is, he 
EXTD=really didn't need to. I've got the bootleg of the complete conce
EXTD=rt and, though his voice is tired and at spots he is struggling, 
EXTD=unsuccessfully, to reach the notes, it's not that bad or that not
EXTD=icable. But really, considering he's now well into his 50s, his o
EXTD=verdubs match incredibly well. You have to listen closely to noti
EXTD=ce it.\n\nGreat to have the complete concert - great to have Tommy
EXTD=at Leeds. Great to have this document from the band who, at the

EXTD=ock Gods At Their Eternal Best, November 1, 2001 \nReviewer: Alan
EXTD=Caylow from USA \n\n"Live At Leeds" is the immortal live album b
EXTD=y The Who, recorded at Leeds University on February 14, 1970, and
EXTD=it still remains the most important live document of this legend
EXTD=ary band, showing for all the world to hear just how monstrous Pe
EXTD=te Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Keith Moon could be
EXTD=live in concert in their 1969-1970 heyday. It's a ferocious, wal
EXTD=lpaper-shredding performance that gives the listener a truly spec
EXTD=ial "You Are There" experience, and it perfectly captures the ban
EXTD=d at the peak of their live powers, playing each number with a fi
EXTD=ery intensity as if their lives depended on it. (The album also f
EXTD=eatures some very funny inbetween-song banter as well, primarily 
EXTD=from Townshend and Moon, which only adds even more value to this 
EXTD=already superb live recording.) The "Live At Leeds" album had bee
EXTD=n brilliantly expanded once before in 1995, but was still incompl
EXTD=ete with the ommission of the band's performance of "Tommy" that 
EXTD=night, apart from the "Amazing Journey/Sparks" extract. But now, 
EXTD=finally, 31 years after it's original release, this Deluxe Editio
EXTD=n of "Live At Leeds," now including the "Tommy" performance, rest
EXTD=ores this landmark Who concert to it's virtual entirety. I say vi
EXTD=rtual because the "Spoonful" segment of "Shakin' All Over" has NO
EXTD=T been restored for some reason (reportedly due to Townshend's di
EXTD=ssatisfaction with the band's rendition of it that night, if such
EXTD=a thing is actually possible). But everything else from the show
EXTD=is now here at last, for which Who fans all over the world can b
EXTD=e very grateful.Listening to the band's slightly-abridged live ve
EXTD=rsion of "Tommy" here (minus "Cousin Kevin," "Underture" and "Wel
EXTD=come," and with a few songs shuffled around in different order), 
EXTD=it goes without saying that it's just as thunderous and brilliant
EXTD=ly performed as the rest of the band's set that historical night 
EXTD=at Leeds University. However, one wishes that "Tommy" had been le
EXTD=ft in the correct performance order on this Deluxe Edition---as t
EXTD=he liner notes reveal, "Tommy" came between "A Quick One While He
EXTD='s Away" and Summertime Blues," but for this special 2-CD set, "T
EXTD=ommy" has been snipped from the performance on CD One and given i
EXTD=t's own showcase on CD Two. But this is an extremely minor quibbl
EXTD=e. I'm just happy to have the live Leeds "Tommy" at all, finally 
EXTD=alongside with the rest of the band's magnificent performance at 
EXTD=last.The surviving members of The Who, now in their fifties, tour
EXTD=ed the U.S. during the summer of 2000, and although I would've lo
EXTD=ved to have seen them, I simply wasn't willing to fork out [amt] 
EXTD=a pop for the best seats. With this outstanding Deluxe Edition of
EXTD="Live At Leeds", a one-time fee of approx. [amt] gets you the gr
EXTD=eatest live recording of the band in their prime that has ever be
EXTD=en made, AND when Keith Moon was still alive and bashing away behin
EXTD=d the drumkit for them, yours to enjoy for all eternity. THAT, my
EXTD=friends, is truly a bargain. :-) \n\nAmazon.com Customer Review\n

EXTD=rom Los Angels \n\nThe playing is incredible, no doubt. No other 
EXTD=band in rock history even comes close to blending musicianship wi

EXTD=s so sophisticated, innovative and original that he reminds you h
EXTD=ow uninspiring most other rock drummers are. The first disc shoul
EXTD=d have its own museum it's so damn hot. However, I have heard bet
EXTD=ter versions of Tommy (Tanglewood 1970 is the best). Roger Daltre
EXTD=y, who is my all time favorite vocalist, seems tired in parts and
EXTD=it's so obvious he re-recorded the vocals for "Listening to You 
EXTD=. ." It's a shame, because his singing at Tanglewood was specta
EXTD=cular. Why release the one version of Tommy where he Daltrey isn'
EXTD=t at his best? And if you are going to re-record his vocals, take
EXTD=his vocals off of another concert from that era when his voice d
EXTD=idn't sound completely different that it does today. Not only did
EXTD=he lay on new vocals, but Pete and John's background vocals have
EXTD=disappeared. And are we ever going to get the full version of "Y
EXTD=oung Man Blues? The complete version includes portions of a Pete 
EXTD=Townshend solo. I love these guys so much I would buy an eight tr

EXTD=tter, September 22, 2001 \nReviewer: Joe from Wayne, New Jersey \n
EXTD=\nThis concert never ceases to amaze me. I first bought Live at L
EXTD=eeds when I was 15 years old and almost wore the vinyl out. The l
EXTD=iner notes (in the 1995 re-issue) say it all about The Who that n
EXTD=ight: "They played like they had a sixth sense". In 1970, it was 
EXTD=the best live album ever put out and it still is. So, imagine how
EXTD=happy I was when it was reissued with additional songs in 1995. 
EXTD=The additions sounded as great as the original album.\n\nSometime
EXTD=thereafter I found bootlegs at cd shows which touted it as the "
EXTD=Complete Live at Leeds" but I wouldn't buy because I feared the u
EXTD=sual poor sound quality of a bootleg. I had also read that Pete T
EXTD=ownshend didn't approve of adding the "Tommy" portion to the 1995
EXTD=release because he believed the sound quality was poor.\nTownshe
EXTD=nd couldn't be more wrong. If the quality was poor, they did a he
EXTD=ll of a job remixing the Deluxe Edition. All instruments and voca
EXTD=ls are as exceptional as the previous releases. The Who themselve
EXTD=s couldn't have planned the way they played that night any better
EXTD=than they did. (In fact, Keith Moon didn't miss a beat the entir
EXTD=e night. He was simply incredible and the Deluxe Edition does him
EXTD=justice.) The Isle of Wight cd, which contained the only availab
EXTD=le entire live performance of "Tommy" when it came out, now sound
EXTD=s like a cover band in comparison. Only a video of this concert c
EXTD=ould top this. This cd was always considered one of the best live
