EXTD=James Brown's two-CD 40th Anniversary Collection gathered 40 of the so
EXTD=ul-funk giant's biggest hits, and in keeping with its title, The 50t
EXTD=h Anniversary Collection is just that little bit bigger and better, wi
EXTD=th (could you guess?) 50 of his most famous tracks. From 1956's "Pleas
EXTD=e, Please, Please" to 1988's "Static, Pts. 1 and 2," it has almost all o
EXTD=f his biggies, though the absence of the 1986 Top Five hit "Living i
EXTD=n America" is puzzling indeed. But that's a minor quibble given the do
EXTD=zens of classics onboard, which taken as a whole not only represent th
EXTD=e best Brown compilation on the market, but also make a plain case fo
EXTD=r the singer as one of the major talents of 20th century American musi
EXTD=c. It's not wholly redundant on the off-chance that you're willing t
EXTD=o replace 40th Anniversary Collection, mopping up a few hits of note (
EXTD="Bewildered," "Bring It Up," "Let Yourself Go," "I Can't Stand Mysel
EXTD=f [When You Touch Me], Pt. 1," "It's a New Day, Pt. 1," "The Popcorn"
EXTD=) that didn't make the cut the previous time around. If you're keepin
EXTD=g score, it does lose a couple minor goodies from 40th Anniversary Col
EXTD=lection ("Money Won't Change You," "King Heroin"). Also, the '70s fun
EXTD=k years might be given too much emphasis and his R&B-soul beginnings s
EXTD=hortchanged, though there are plenty of other reissues of his '50s/'60
EXTD=s material out there if you want to investigate further. Want anothe
EXTD=r minor quibble on what is nonetheless a superb anthology? 40th Annive
EXTD=rsary Collection came out in 1996 - The 50th Anniversary Collection cam
EXTD=e out in 2003. Now that's the sort of creative accounting only a marke
