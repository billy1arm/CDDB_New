EXTD=retha Franklin has simply been one of the greatest singers of the
EXTD=modern generation, and whether bringing her powerful, passionate
EXTD=voice to bear on gospel standards, songs from the Great American
EXTD=Songbook, jazz standards, pop ditties, or deep Southern soul and
EXTD=R&B, she has always had the presence -- much like Ray Charles --
EXTD=to make anything she touches unmistakably hers. Franklin began h
EXTD=er career in gospel when she was still a teenager, and her amazin
EXTD=g vocal talents, coupled with her fine piano playing, marked her 
EXTD=as a once-in-a-lifetime kind of artist, qualities very apparent t
EXTD=o legendary talent scout John Hammond, who signed her to Columbia
EXTD=Records. The problem Hammond and Columbia immediately ran into, 
EXTD=though, was how to best present that spirited voice to the secula
EXTD=r pop world. Between 1960 and 1969 (her first release for the lab
EXTD=el was actually in 1961), Columbia tried Franklin in a variety of
EXTD=styles and settings, and if none of them exactly caught fire the
EXTD=way her legendary later sides for Atlantic Records would, they s
EXTD=till allowed Franklin to explore a lot of avenues, and she was to
EXTD=o good a singer not to be at least memorable in all of them. This
EXTD=wonderful box set includes CDs of Franklin's seven full-length a
EXTD=lbums for the label, two CDs of her work with producers Bobby Sco
EXTD=tt (in 1963) and Clyde Otis (in 1964), a CD of singles produced b
EXTD=y Bob Johnston, plus rarities that were sweetened and released af
EXTD=ter Franklin left Columbia for Atlantic and a DVD featuring Frank
EXTD=lin performing several songs at the piano on The Steve Allen Show
EXTD=in 1964. It's a tremendous set, and it portrays an artist workin
EXTD=g her own way toward how to best present herself to the world. We
EXTD=all know she got there.  -- Steve Leggett\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:
