EXTD=Originally Released October 1995\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: This seven
EXTD=CD set is remarkable in several ways. The packaging is quite uni
EXTD=que for the box is a plastic reproduction of a 1940s radio. Subti

EXTD=iving listeners the complete Mercury output of several top artist
EXTD=s. There are 34 songs from pianist Albert Ammons (two featuring b
EXTD=lues singer Sippie Wallace) which find Ammons turning everything 
EXTD=(including "Red Sails in the Sunset," "Roses of  Picardy" and "Ma
EXTD=rgie") into boogie-woogie - a session with his son, tenor-saxophon
EXTD=ist Gene Ammons, is a highpoint. Singer Helen Humes is showcased 
EXTD=on 16 stomps and ballads, pianist Jay McShann (often with vocalis
EXTD=ts Jimmy Witherspoon or Walter Brown) has 24 songs and Eddie "Cle
EXTD=anhead" Vinson (on alto and vocals) is heard in a variety of sett
EXTD=ings on 30 selections. In addition there are nine tunes featuring
EXTD=R&B pianist/singer Professor Longhair, four songs apiece from si
EXTD=ngers Julia Lee, Myra Taylor and cornetist Rex Stewart, 12 pieces

EXTD=RT REVIEW: If the exquisitely packaged - the box is shaped like a
EXTD=n old-time radio - limited-edition The 1940s Mercury Sessions is 
EXTD=too extravagantly priced or simply unobtainable, this single-disc
EXTD=sampler is the next best thing. For all of the diverse backgroun
EXTD=ds and destinations of Mercury's artists, the music on this CD ha
EXTD=s a distinct identity, conjuring a  forgotten time when swing and
EXTD=bop mixed easily with emerging rhythm and  blues in bite-sized, un
EXTD=der-three-minute slices suitable for every jukebox in every juke 
EXTD=joint in the land. The CD leads off with a sampling  of the super
EXTD=charged Albert Ammons piano boogie sessions with a tight  little 
EXTD=rhythm section (there are more madly swinging choices than these,
EXTD=but you'll get the idea). We hear a pair of Helen Humes blues cu
EXTD=ts  with loose Buck Clayton-led backup groups, a neat Jay McShann
EXTD=sextet with vintage blues shouting by Jimmy Witherspoon, Eddie "
EXTD=Cleanhead" Vinson's exuberantly bright blues vocals and alto sax,
EXTD=Professor Longhair 's early blues-drenched incarnation as plain 
EXTD=old Roy Byrd, and Cootie  Williams leading a hot jump sextet with
EXTD=tenor Willis Jackson blowin' his fool head off. Only the ornery 
EXTD=Buddy Rich defies the Mercury jump-blues sound with two unrepenta
EXTD=nt sides of big-band swing. Above all, this is a most entertainin
EXTD=g souvenir of a time when jazz was still a form of popular music.
