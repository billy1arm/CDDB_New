EXTT0=Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear. And
EXTT0=I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take 
EXTT0=the wheel and steer. It's driven me before, and it seems to h
EXTT0=ave a vague, haunting mass appeal. But lately I am beginning 
EXTT0=to find that I should be the one behind the wheel. Whatever t
EXTT0=omorrow brings, I'll be there with open arms and open eyes. S
EXTT0=o if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive will 
EXTT0=I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive? It's driv
EXTT0=en me before and it seems to be the way that everyone else ge
EXTT0=ts around. But lately I'm beginning to find that when I drive
EXTT0=myself my light is found. So whatever tomorrow brings, I'll 
EXTT0=be there with open arms and open eyes. Yeh. Would you kill th
EXTT0=e Queen to crush the hive? Would you choose water over wine..
EXTT0=hold the wheel and drive?
EXTT1=You saw me lost and treading water\nI looked pathetic\nI look
EXTT1=ed as helpless as a stinger without a bee\nBut underneath my 
EXTT1=presentation, yea\nI knew the walls were coming down\nAnd the
EXTT1=stones that fell were aiming away from me\nHey what would it
EXTT1=mean to you\nTo know that it'll come back around again\nHey 
EXTT1=whatever it means to you\nKnow that everything moves in circl
EXTT1=es\nI saw you standing in my headlights (blink, blink, blink)
EXTT1=\nI thought I'd run you down for the weight you left on me\nI
EXTT1=nstead I pushed rewind, reversed and drove away\nAnd seeing y
EXTT1=ou disappear in my rearview\nBrought to me the word reciproci
EXTT1=ty\nHey what would it mean to you\nTo know that it'll come ba
EXTT1=ck around again\nHey whatever it means to you\nKnow that ever
EXTT1=ything moves in circles\nRound and round we go\nWho would've 
EXTT1=known it'd end so well\nWe fall on and we fall off\nexistenti
EXTT1=al carousel
EXTT2=I'd like to close my eyes and go numb but there's a cold wind
EXTT2=coming from the top of the highest high-rise today. It's not
EXTT2=a breeze cause' it blows hard. Yes and it wants me to discar
EXTT2=d the humanity I know, watch the warmth blow away. Don't let 
EXTT2=the world bring you down. Not everyone here is that fucked up
EXTT2=and cold. Remember why you came and while you're alive exper
EXTT2=ience the warmth before you grow old.  Do you think I should 
EXTT2=adhere to that pressing new frontier? And leave in my wake a 
EXTT2=trail of fear(?) Or should I hold my head up high and throw a
EXTT2=wrench and spokes by leaving the air behind me clear? 
EXTT3=\n\nBlink and you miss a beat. Keep one of your eyes open at 
EXTT3=all times. Think that you're on the brink? The shit hasn't ev
EXTT3=en begun to hit the fan. Consequence you'll see will be stran
EXTT3=ger than a gang of drunken mimes. Situation has a stink. Bett
EXTT3=er clear the air before your son becomes a man. Blink. Everyt
EXTT3=hing's been augmented, you've been left so far behind. Think,
EXTT3=for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the ba
EXTT3=ck of your head. Consequence you've seen has been stranger th
EXTT3=an sci-fi of any kind. Situation baffles me. I guess it's tru
EXTT3=e you too are one of the walking dead. You better think fast!
EXTT3=Cause' you never know what's comin' around the bend. You bet
EXTT3=ter not blink! For Consequence is a bigger word than you thin
EXTT3=k. It's bigger than you or me.
EXTT4=Bat your eyes girl\nBe otherworldly\nCount your blessings\nSe
EXTT4=duce a stranger\nWhat's so wrong with\nBeing happy\nKudos to 
EXTT4=those who\nSee through sickness\nWhen she woke in the morning
EXTT4=\nShe knew that her life had passed her by\nAnd she called ou
EXTT4=t a warning\nDon't ever let life pass you by\nI suggest we\nL
EXTT4=earn to love ourselves before it's\nMade illegal\nWhen will w
EXTT4=e learn?\nWhen will we change?\nJust in time to\nSee it all f
EXTT4=all down\nThose left standing...will make millions\nWriting b
EXTT4=ooks on the way it should have been\nWhen she woke in the mor
EXTT4=ning\nShe knew that her life had passed her by\nAnd she calle
EXTT4=d out a warning\nDon't ever let life pass you by\nFloating in
EXTT4=this\nCosmic jacuzzi\nWe are like frogs oblivious\nTo the wa
EXTT4=ter\nStarting to boil\nNo one flinches\nWe all flow face down
EXTT4=\nWhen she woke in the morning\nShe knew that her life had pa
EXTT4=ssed her by\nAnd she called out a warning\nDon't ever let lif
EXTT4=e pass you by
EXTT5=You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches, you can't make
EXTT5=me think like you, mundane. I've got a message for all those
EXTT5=who think that they can etch his words inside my brain T.V.,
EXTT5=what do I need? Tell me who to believe! What's the use of au
EXTT5=tonomy when a button does it all? So listen up, glisten up cl
EXTT5=osely all, who've seen the fuckin eye ache too. It's time to 
EXTT5=step away from cable train And when we finally see the subtle
EXTT5=light, this quirk in evolution will begin to let us live and
EXTT5=recreate T.V., what do I need? Tell me who to believe! Whats
EXTT5=the use of autonomy when a button does it all? T.V., what sh
EXTT5=ould I see? Tell me who should I be? Lets do our mom a favor 
EXTT5=and drop a new god off a wall. Let me see past the fatuous kn
EXTT5=ocks. I've gotta rid myself of this idiot box! Let you see pa
EXTT5=st the feathers and flocks, and help me plant a bomb in this 
EXTT5=idiot box! From the depths of the sea to the tops of the tree
EXTT5=s to the seat of a lazy boy... staring at a silver screen!! 
EXTT6=I dig my toes into the sand\nThe ocean looks like a thousand 
EXTT6=diamonds strewn across a blue blanket\nI lean against the win
EXTT6=d\nPretend that I am weightless\nAnd in this moment I am happ
EXTT6=y...happy\nI wish you were here\nI lay my head into the sand\n
EXTT6=The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it\n
EXTT6=I'm counting UFO's\nI signal them with my lighter\nAnd in thi
EXTT6=s moment I am happy...happy\nI wish you were here\nThe world'
EXTT6=s a roller coaster and I am not strapped in\nMaybe I should h
EXTT6=old with care but my hands are busy in the air
EXTT7=Today, everything was fine. Until roundabout, quarter to nine
EXTT7=, I suddenly found myself in a bind. Was it something I said?
EXTT7=Something I read and manifested that's getting you down. Don
EXTT7='t you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in you eye, 
EXTT7=I'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried. Say what 
EXTT7=you will, say what you mean. You could never offend, your dir
EXTT7=ty words come out clean. Tomorrow, what price will I pay? Cou
EXTT7=ld I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed? 
EXTT7=Would you then gimme the time of day? I need a map of your he
EXTT7=ad, translated into English so I can learn to not make you fr
EXTT7=own. You'd feel better if you'd vent, put your frustrations i
EXTT7=nto four letter words and let them out on mine, the most weat
EXTT7=hered ears in town. Say what you will, say what you mean. You
EXTT7=could never offend, your dirty words come out clean.
EXTT8=Meet me in outer space. WE could spend the night - watch the e
EXTT8=arth come up. I've grown tired of that place - won't you come 
EXTT8=with me? WE could start again. How do you do it? Make me feel
EXTT8=like I do. How do you do it? It's better than I ever knew. M
EXTT8=eet me in outer space. I will hold you close, if you're afrai
EXTT8=d of heights. I need you to see this place, it might be the o
EXTT8=nly way that I can show you how it feels to be inside of you.
EXTT8=How do you do it? Make me feel like I do. How do you do it? 
EXTT8=It's better than I ever knew. You are stellar.\n

EXTT9=that every line drawn reflected a life that you loved not an
EXTT9=existence that you hated So, must we demonstrate that we can
EXTT9='t get it straight? We've painted a picture, now we're drowni

EXTT11=st fear will be the rescue of you\nStrange how it turns out t
EXTT11=hat way\nCould you show me dear...something I've not seen?\nS
EXTT11=omething infinitely interesting\n\n
EXTT12=To see you when I wake up is a gift I didn't think could be r
EXTT12=eal. To know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold, 
EXTT12=utopian dream. You do something to me that I can't explain. S
EXTT12=o would I be out of line if I said, I miss you.(?) I see your
EXTT12=picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine.
EXTT12=You have only been gone ten days, but already I'm wasting aw
EXTT12=ay. I know I'll see you again whether far or soon. But I need
EXTT12=you to know that I care and I miss you.
EXTT13=If I hadn't made me, I would've been made somehow. If I hadn'
EXTT13=t assembled myself, I'dve fallen apart by now. If I hadn't ma
EXTT13=de me, I'd be more inclined to bow. Powers that be would have
EXTT13=swallowed me up, but that's more than I can allow. If you le
EXTT13=t them make you, they'll make you papier-mache. At a distance
EXTT13=you're strong, until the wind comes then you crumble and blo
EXTT13=w away. If you let them fuck you, there will be no foreplay. 
EXTT13=But rest assured, they'll screw you complete til' your ass is
EXTT13=blue and grey. You should make amends with you. If only for 
EXTT13=better health. But if you really want to live, why not try an
EXTT13=d Make Yourself? If I hadn't made me, I'dve fallen apart by n
EXTT13=ow. I won't let em' make me, it's more than I can allow. So w
EXTT13=hen I make me, I won't be papier-mache. And if I fuck me...I'
EXTT13=ll fuck me in my own way. You should make amends with you. If
EXTT13=only for better health. But if you really want to live, why 
EXTT13=not try and Make Yourself? Make Yourself.
EXTT14=I'm home alone tonight. Full moon illuminates my room, and se
EXTT14=nds my mind aflight. I think I was dreaming up some thoughts 
EXTT14=that were seemingly possible...with you. So I call you on the
EXTT14=tin can phone. We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure
EXTT14=we're alone. I may have found a way for you and I to finally
EXTT14=fly free. When we get there, we're gonna go far away. Making
EXTT14=sure to laugh - while we experience anti-gravity. For years, 
EXTT14=I kept to myself. Now potentialities are bound, and sleeping 
EXTT14=under my shelf. Simply choose your destination from the diamo
EXTT14=nd canopy, and we'll be there. So I call you on the tin can p
EXTT14=hone. We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure we're alo
EXTT14=ne. I may have found the way for you and I to finally be free

EXTT15=that were seemingly possible...with you. So I call you on the
EXTT15=tin can phone. We rendezvous a quarter-two, and make sure we

EXTT16=Better than watching Gellar bending silver spoons\nBetter tha
EXTT16=n witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom\nShe who sees from up h
EXTT16=igh smiles and surely sings\nPerspective pries your once weig
EXTT16=hty eyes and it gives you wings\nI haven't felt the way I fee
EXTT16=l today\nIn so long it's hard for me to specify\nI'm beginnin
EXTT16=g to notice how much this feels\nLike a waking limb, pins and
EXTT16=needles, nice to know you\nGoodbye, nice to know you\nGoodby
EXTT16=e, nice to know you\nDeeper than the deepest Cousteau would e
EXTT16=ver go\nAnd higher than the heights of what we often think we
EXTT16=know\nBlessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees\nT

EXTT16=en't felt the way I feel today\nIn so long it's hard for me t

EXTT16=a waking limb, pins and needles, nice to know you\nGoodbye, n
EXTT16=ice to know you\nGoodbye, nice to know you\nSo could it be th
EXTT16=at it has been there all along?\n\n
EXTT17=Will I ever get to where I'm going? Will I ever follow throug
EXTT17=h with what I had planned. I guess it's possible that I have 
EXTT17=been a bit distracted and the directions for me are a lot les
EXTT17=s in demand. Will I ever get to where I'm going? If I do, wil
EXTT17=l I know when I'm there? If the wind blew me in the right dir
EXTT17=ection would I even care? I would. I take a look around - it's
EXTT17=evident the scene has changed. And there are times when I fe
EXTT17=el improved upon the past. Then there are times when I can't 
EXTT17=seem to understand at all and yes it seems as though I'm goin
EXTT17=g nowhere... really fucking fast.
EXTT18=A decade ago, I never thought I would be, at twenty three, on
EXTT18=the verge of spontaneous combustion. Woe-is-me. But I guess 
EXTT18=that it comes with the territory - an ominous landscape of nev
EXTT18=er ending calamity. I need you to hear, I need you to see tha
EXTT18=t I have had all I can take and exploding seems like a defini
EXTT18=te possibility to me. So pardon me while I burst into flames.
EXTT18=I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless game
EXTT18=s. So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame. Pardon
EXTT18=me, pardon me....I'll never be the same. Not two days ago, I
EXTT18=was having a look in a book and I saw a picture of a guy fri
EXTT18=ed up above his knees. I said, "I can relate," cause' lately 
EXTT18=I've been thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation f
EXTT18=rom the burdens of the planet earth. Like gravity, hypocrisy,
EXTT18=and the perils of being in 3-D... and thinking so much diffe
EXTT18=rently. So pardon me while I burst into flames. I've had enou
EXTT18=gh of the world and it's people's mindless games. So pardon m
EXTT18=e while I burn and rise above the flame. Pardon 
EXTT19=Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy? Isn't it weir
EXTT19=d that a privilege could feel like a chore? Maybe it's me but
EXTT19=this line isn't going anywhere, maybe if we looked hard enou
EXTT19=gh, we could find a backdoor. (Find yourself a backdoor.) I s
EXTT19=ee you in line, dragging your feet you have my sympathy. The 
EXTT19=day you were born, you were born free. That is your privilege
EXTT19=Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me doesn
EXTT19='t have a clue why he's waiting, or what he's waiting for? Ma
EXTT19=ybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy. Maybe if I look 
EXTT19=in my heart I could find a backdoor. (Find yourself a backdoo
EXTT19=r.) I see you in line, dragging your feet you have my sympath
EXTT19=y. The day you were born, you were born free. That is your pr
EXTT19=ivilege.\n
