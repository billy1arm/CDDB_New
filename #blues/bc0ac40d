EXTD=pletes the transition away from her smooth cabaret beginnings and
EXTD=toward a mellowly arty, modern singer/songwriter. Jones began th
EXTD=is shift on 2007's Not Too Late, an album that gently rejected he
EXTD=r tendencies for lulling, tasteful crooning, but The Fall is a st
EXTD=ronger, more cohesive work, maintaining an elegantly dreamy state
EXTD=that's faithful to the crooner of Come Away with Me while feelin

EXTD=Jones' choice of producer, Jacquire King, best-known for his work

EXTD=call attention to themselves, the way that some Jon O'Brien prod
EXTD=uctions do. Instead, the focus is always on Jones' voice and song
EXTD=s, which are once again all originals, sometimes composed in conj
EXTD=unction with collaborators including her longtime colleagues Jess
EXTD=e Harris, Ryan Adams, and Will Sheff of Okkervil River. In additi
EXTD=on to King's pedigree, the latter two co-writers suggest a slight
EXTD=indie bent to Jones' direction, which isn't an inaccurate impres
EXTD=sion -- there's certainly a late-night N.Y.C. vibe to these songs
EXTD=- but it's easy to overstate the artiness of The Fall, especial
EXTD=ly when compared to Not Too Late, which wore its ragged ambitions
EXTD=proudly. Here, Jones ties up loose ends, unafraid to sound smoot
EXTD=h or sultry, letting in just enough dissonance and discord to giv

EXTD=m\n\nNorah Jones: The Fall \nGrade: B \nby Don Leibold November 1
EXTD=7, 2009   \n \nOverwhelming popularity can do a number on an arti
EXTD=st. Nirvana's success resulted in what is arguably the band's bes
EXTD=t album, In Utero, but also likely hastened Kurt Cobain's downwar
EXTD=d spiral. Like Nirvana, jazz singer Norah Jones is the rare diamo
EXTD=nd-selling artist: Her 2002 debut, Come Away With Me, has sold mo
EXTD=re than 10 million copies. Unlike Cobain, Jones has found success
EXTD=liberating. She has been prolific, releasing two albums under he
EXTD=r own name and forming two bands, the country-minded Little Willi
EXTD=es and the more raucous El Madmo. She's even tried acting. All of
EXTD=this speaks to a desire for experience and experimentation. With
EXTD=her latest, The Fall, Jones makes her biggest push to brush away
EXTD=the coffeehouse connotations of her early work. The Fall is a co
EXTD=ncept album with a punchline, with most of the songs detailing th
EXTD=e push and pull of a faltering relationship. Several, including t
EXTD=he first single, "Chasing Pirates," explore confusion and uncerta
EXTD=inty. Others celebrate reconciliation. In "I Wouldn't Need You," 
EXTD=Jones implores her lover to return - then in "Back To Manhattan," 
EXTD=she's the one returning. By the penultimate song, "Tell Yer Mama,
EXTD=" Jones has cut her man loose, her kiss-off made bitterer by her 
EXTD=critique of his parents. The album's punchline is "Man Of The Hou
EXTD=r," a cute, spare song about how the only man for her is her dog.

EXTD=y Leah Greenblatt | Nov 04, 2009 Leah Greenblatt\n\n''The reports
EXTD=of my death are greatly exaggerated,'' Mark Twain famously quipp
EXTD=ed. So too are reports of Norah Jones' rock conversion. True, the
EXTD=Grammy-festooned pop-jazz chanteuse has largely forsaken her tra
EXTD=ditional post at the piano for a six-string on her fourth album (
EXTD=out Nov. 17), and she's roped in a passel of collaborators (inclu
EXTD=ding Ryan Adams and frequent Beck sideman Smokey Hormel) not nece
EXTD=ssarily known for catering to the quiet-storm set. She's also got
EXTD=a voice that seems made to jump genres: supple, mellifluous, eff
EXTD=ortlessly sexy. But even when Jones lets it rip, so to speak, as 
EXTD=on The Fall's moderately rollicking saloon stomper ''It's Gonna B
EXTD=e,'' she remains, at heart, a girl gone mild.\n\nWhich is not to 
EXTD=say she can't rustle up ? a fire -- just that it's more candlelig
EXTD=ht than call-the-FDNY blaze. The rainy-day requiem ''Light as a F
EXTD=eather'' and bluesy swooner ''I Wouldn't Need You'' exude an eleg
EXTD=ant sort of speakeasy allure, and studio pros like Hormel and dru
EXTD=mmer Joey Waronker (Beck, R.E.M.) make it all run with the soothi
EXTD=ng sweep of a Swiss timepiece. Still, even her most upbeat number
EXTD=s seem designed specifically to keep some choleric CEO's high blo
EXTD=od pressure in check. On the Wurlitzer-steeped lead single ''Chas
EXTD=ing Pirates,'' when she croons ''And I don't know how, to slow it
EXTD=down/My mind's racing,'' it sounds not so much rushing as recumb
EXTD=ent. One wishes that just once, Jones would goose her adult-conte
EXTD=mporary golden-girl status -- and let it race for real. B-\n\n\n-

EXTD=r 15, 2009 \n\nNorah Jones isn't quite so serene or folky anymore
EXTD=On her fourth album, "The Fall," she moves away from both a rom
EXTD=ance and the sound that made her one of this decade's few consist
EXTD=ent million-sellers.\n\nMs. Jones still mostly writes ballads and
EXTD=waltzes, and still lingers over their melodies in long, breathy 
EXTD=phrases. She's still willing to sing lines as plain spoken as "I 
EXTD=need you to love me." But now the guitars backing her are usually
EXTD=electric, the drums aren't shy, and there's an anxious, wounded 
EXTD=undertone to her voice. It's the sonic and emotional expansion he
EXTD=r music needed, and its tied to some of her most unguarded songs.
EXTD=\n\n"The Fall" is the first solo album Ms. Jones has made withou
EXTD=t Lee Alexander, her former boyfriend, bassist, songwriting colla
EXTD=borator and producer. Many of her new songs revolve around a brea
EXTD=kup that she presents as protracted, tangled and ambivalent. "Why
EXTD=can't it be easy? Easy? Why don't you leave me?," she sings in "
EXTD=Stuck," a song she wrote with Will Sheff of Okkervil River that s
EXTD=uggests both Neil Young and the Beatles.\n\nMs. Jones stays more 
EXTD=pensive than angry -- she's no vengeful emo wailer -- and aching 
EXTD=loneliness is still her element, particularly in songs like "Wait
EXTD=ing" and "I Wouldn't Need You." But she gets in some digs with "T
EXTD=ell Yer Mama," in which she thanks her ex's parents for raising h
EXTD=im "so damn wrong."\n\nFor this album Ms. Jones set aside most of
EXTD=her usual coterie of tiptoeing acoustic sidemen. "The Fall," pro
EXTD=duced by Jacquire King -- an engineer for Tom Waits, Modest Mouse
EXTD=and Kings of Leon -- plugs her in.\n\nHer own guitar, usually el
EXTD=ectric, is abetted by selectively noisy guitarists like Marc Ribo
EXTD=t and Smokey Hormel (both sometime Waits sidemen). She brought ba
EXTD=ck Jesse Harris, who wrote her career-making hit "Don't Know Why,
EXTD=" to collaborate on "Even Though," a reggae-tinged song, with spl
EXTD=ashes of distorted guitar, about temptation: "I know trouble will
EXTD=follow, but I have to go."\n\nThe arrangements are sparse and na
EXTD=turalistic but more dimly lighted than on previous albums - they h
EXTD=ave shadowy, echo-y fringes. Some songs, like the waltzing "You'v
EXTD=e Ruined Me" -- "Thought I liked it, but I'm ruined/My whole worl
EXTD=d's now turned upside-down" -- are easy to imagine with her old b
EXTD=and playing them just a little more quietly. But Ms. Jones approa
EXTD=ches the heft of roots-rock in songs like "Young Blood" and "Ligh
EXTD=t as a Feather," while the opening chords, backbeat and programme
EXTD=d drums of "Chasing Pirates" hint distantly at Madonna's "Like a 
EXTD=Virgin." Cautiously but deliberately Ms. Jones is making a new st

EXTD=it from her comfort zone, but Mayer goes more mainstream\nBy Alli
EXTD=son Stewart\nTuesday, November 17, 2009 \n\nAt this point in thei
EXTD=r careers, John Mayer and Norah Jones, the reigning King and Quee
EXTD=n of Minivan Rock, need to make peace with their amiable dullness
EXTD=, or do something about it. Both artists specialize in good-but-n
EXTD=ot-interesting discs that prize virtuosity (Jones's voice, Mayer'
EXTD=s guitar playing) over innovation. Both artists, who are releasin
EXTD=g their fourth solo studio discs on the same day, try for modest 
EXTD=makeovers - only Jones succeeds. \n\nSince releasing her platinum-
EXTD=times-infinity debut, "Come Away With Me," Jones has slowly, judi
EXTD=ciously tweaked her sound, moving from mild brunch-friendly jazz 
EXTD=to mild, brunch-friendly country-jazz to the mild, brunch-friendl
EXTD=y rock of "The Fall." Jones picks her way carefully through the d
EXTD=isc's decorous tracks, investing her usually unruffled sound with
EXTD=just enough rough-and-tumble to suggest she has heard, and agree
EXTD=s with, every S'Norah Jones joke ever made. \n\nPopulated by midt
EXTD=empo guitar ballads and produced by Tom Waits collaborator Jacqui
EXTD=re King, "The Fall" is extravagantly pretty and inevitably famili
EXTD=ar, even as it takes nominal detours into lite funk (the breakup 
EXTD=ballad "Back to Manhattan") and lite soul (the fine first single,
EXTD="Chasing Pirates"). Jones wisely pairs with unthreatening eccent
EXTD=rics like Ryan Adams (who co-wrote the sleepy, lovely "Light as a
EXTD=Feather") and, on the atmospheric "Stuck," Okkervil River's Will
EXTD=Sheff, who has enough quirk to supply a dozen Starbucks divas an
EXTD=d still have enough left over for Feist. \n\nJones has always app
EXTD=eared genuinely torn between the adventurous artist she seems to 
EXTD=want to be and the immaculate, unthrilling albums she actually ma
EXTD=kes. On "The Fall," that gulf narrows, but only slightly. On the 
EXTD=opening ballad, "Chasing Pirates," she addresses a lover who want
EXTD=s to call it an evening, complaining that she's "not done with th
EXTD=e night." Because this is a Norah Jones album, it's not a night o
EXTD=f wild debauchery she has in mind - she just wants to finish her b
EXTD=ook. \n\nJones may want to be edgier, but John Mayer wants to be 
EXTD=Sting. Even worse: He's succeeding. Sting at least had a good run
EXTD=as a post-punk icon before settling down to a life of castles an
EXTD=d fustiness and earnest adult contemporary songs about nuclear wa
EXTD=r. But since his debut, the 32-year-old Mayer has aimed for the m
EXTD=iddle of the road like a lukewarm-seeking missile. \n\n\n"Battle 
EXTD=Studies" is a loosely woven concept album about relationships as 
EXTD=a form of combat, land so well-tilled by Pat Benatar in the early
EXTD='80s that it need never be revisited. Mayer is a dead-on singer 
EXTD=and a peerless guitarist, but he can be a lackadaisical songwrite
EXTD=r. "Battle Studies" bogs down under the weight of too many toothl
EXTD=ess sound-alike ballads about the futility of love, too many song
EXTD=s with their title repeated over and over, in place of an actual 
EXTD=chorus. \n\nThere are exceptions: "Half of My Heart" is a great '
EXTD=70s-throwback duet with an under-deployed Taylor Swift - "Who Says
EXTD=" is an everydude defense of herb-smoking cloaked as a libertaria
EXTD=n broadside that makes his not-that-bad-in-retrospect "Waiting on
EXTD=the World to Change" sound like "All Along the Watchtower" by co
EXTD=mparison. \n\nJones, at least, seems as endearingly snoozy off-re
EXTD=cord as on. But for Mayer, whose whip-smart interviews and richly
EXTD=documented dating life suggest that an actual interesting person
EXTD=resides underneath all that hair, teeth and fondness for metapho
EXTD=rs, such musical innocuousness is unforgivable. Merely by existin
EXTD=g, "Battle Studies" violates Internet Rule 17: Never let your Twi
