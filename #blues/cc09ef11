EXTD=REVIEW: John Denver's music always had a warm, home-spun quality 
EXTD=to it, so it isn't surprising that his 1975 holiday effort, Rocky
EXTD=Mountain Christmas, is a wonderfully low-key and friendly Christ
EXTD=mas album. Divided between classic carols and new numbers, such a
EXTD=s the fine "Aspenglow" and "Christmas for Cowboys," the album is 
EXTD=an appealing, pretty record, perfect for late nights by the fires
EXTD=ide. The 1998 CD reissue adds five bonus tracks: "Jingle Bells," 
EXTD="White Christmas," "The Music is You," "Perhaps Love," and "Dream
EXTD=land Express." -- Rodney Batdorf \n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\n
EXTD=John Denver's folk music couldn't hide the fact that he was a dee
EXTD=ply spiritual man. The reverence with which he imbues Rocky Mt. C
EXTD=hristmas is equally obvious, even when the songs have a more secu
EXTD=lar theme. The standards like "What Child Is This" and "Silent Ni
EXTD=ght" are moving pieces of inspiration. However, "Please Daddy (Do
EXTD=n't Get Drunk This Christmas)" is a painful inclusion, whether it
EXTD='s intended to be autobiographical or not. But hey, holiday memor
EXTD=ies aren't always happy ones. "Aspenglow" is Denver's tribute to 
EXTD=his beloved Colorado, while his decision to throw in "Rudolph the
EXTD=Red-Nosed Reindeer" seems to have been a perfunctory one. It's f
EXTD=orgivable, though, especially after hearing his charm-laden "Chri
EXTD=stmas Song." --Steve Gdula \n \nHalf.com Album Notes\nThis 1998 r
EXTD=eissue contains 5 bonus tracks (including the previously\nunrelea
EXTD=sed "White Christmas") not included on the original release.\nPro

EXTD=e a "Rocky Mountain Christmas" more because John Denver is singin

EXTD=ains. Only the opening track, "Aspenglow," would suggest the late
EXTD=r, but I know I am not alone in associating Denver's music with t
EXTD=hat western mountain chain (I always listen to his first greatest
EXTD=hits album why driving through the Rockies). Besides that first 
EXTD=track Denver also had a hand in writing "A Baby Just Like You" an
EXTD=d the last three bonus tracks on the album, but the chief charm h
EXTD=ere is hearing songs like "Silver Bells" turned into John Denver 
EXTD=songs. \n\n"Rocky Mountain Christmas" is ideal for quiet nights i
EXTD=n front of the fire. Most of the songs rely on simple accompanime
EXTD=nt by acoustic guitars, although sometimes an entire country band
EXTD=shows up for the likes of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and a
EXTD=harpsichord pops up as well. But clearly the effort here is to k
EXTD=eep things simple. There is a nice trio of traditional carols in 
EXTD=the middle of the album with "Away in a Manger," "What Child is T
EXTD=his?" and "Coventry Carol," which makes up for having "Please Dad
EXTD=dy (Don't Get Drunk This Christmas)" intruding in the lineup (for
EXTD=me it stands out like a sore thumb). Fortunately in between the 
EXTD=two is Eric Weisberg's "Christmas for Cowboys," which serves as a
EXTD=nice transition. \n\nActually the songs that impressed me the mo
EXTD=st were the ones where Denver tackles something different, which 
EXTD=would be "Coventry Carol" and "O Holy Night." The accompaniments 
EXTD=are more formal and so is his singing, but still with his distinc
EXTD=tive tenor voice. This is the 1998 reissue of the CD and as such 
EXTD=adds five bonus tracks to make it even better: "Jingle Bells," "W
EXTD=hite Christmas," "The Music is You," "Perhaps Love," and "Dreamla
EXTD=nd Express." The last three are not exactly Christmas songs and g
EXTD=ive the end of the album a decidedly different feel, so you may a
EXTD=ctually just want the CD with 14 tracks and not this one with 17 
EXTD=(I do not believe you can get a CD with just the 12 tracks from t
EXTD=he original album). Or else you can just program this one to end 
EXTD=the way you want.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nJust like the 
EXTD=LP, December 18, 2005\nReviewer: Sidney A. Meyer "treighnor" (Flo
EXTD=rida]\nApparently this album has been released in at least three 
EXTD=different formats. One contains two extra tracks and another even
EXTD=more. Perhaps they are a better bargain and you get to hear more
EXTD=John Denver, but this CD remains true to the original album and 
EXTD=concept. Somehow having tracks after "A Baby Just Like You" would
EXTD=spoil the album. This is typical Denver, reverent, irreverent, m
EXTD=ellow, lively. John was a study in opposites. He blended folk wit
EXTD=h country and was the first artist to broaden the base of country
EXTD=music listeners. The current popularity of country music has muc
EXTD=h to owe John Denver. Before him, it had a much narrower followin
EXTD=g. "Aspenglow" is a lovely tune, one that I like to hear every Ch
EXTD=ristmas, even though it is not traditional. The oddest track is "
EXTD=Please, Daddy, Don't Get Drunk this Christmas." Even more peculia
EXTD=r is the fact that I really like this track. It is certainly memo
EXTD=rable, and in its way brings home the fact that not every child h

EXTD=r: M. Jenkins (Houston, TX]\nWhen my parents moved from my childh

EXTD=ries, November 22, 2004\nReviewer: Jeffrey Davis (Tallahassee, FL
EXTD=]\nThe music sends me years back to the feeling of Christmas when
EXTD=I was young. My parents had the original 8 track and played this
EXTD=while mom baked Christmas sweets in the kitchen and dad was outs
EXTD=ide placing lights and decorations on the house. For a CD to tran
EXTD=sport you back, to pull on some forgotten heartstrings long ago f
EXTD=orgotten it must be a great buy. Makes me miss the simplicity of 
EXTD=Christmas as a child but I look forward to sharing this music of 
EXTD=a great artist for many years to come. \nBTW ....Yes "Please Dadd
EXTD=y" is a downer of a song and kind of silly but I think John Denve

EXTD=31, 2003\nReviewer: Jeffrey LaBonte (Boston, MA]\nDespite the cr
EXTD=iticism from many, "Please Daddy..." is the reason I love this al
EXTD=bum. I grew up with my parents playing Denver year-round, but I a
EXTD=lways loved this album and long for that one song. As an adult, i
EXTD=t seems "Please Daddy..." is more somber than its melody would im

EXTD=\nThis is a definitive Christmas album, all that such an album sh
EXTD=ould be with several familiar favorites and several less heard or
EXTD=new ones.\nJohn Denver bridges the pop-folk-country boundaries a
EXTD=nd gives us good doses of each.\n\nHe opens with "Aspenglow", as 
EXTD=typical Denver as you can get, and goes on with some familiar son
EXTD=gs of the season, but also surprises us with new material. "Pleas
EXTD=e Daddy, Don't Get Drunk This Christmas" delivered in a strong co
EXTD=untry manner certainly isn't something you'll find on your typica
EXTD=l Christmas album. The way it's delivered, it sounds almost autob
EXTD=iographical, and it sure is a song to make a person think. \n\nHi
EXTD=s original, "A Child Like You", is a real standout. Oh yes, that 
EXTD="Jingle Bells" delivered as an emotional, nostalgic ballad...\n\n
EXTD=Trust me, this is a Christmas CD you should have.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM

EXTD=vember 24, 2002\nReviewer: Kent Taylor (Perkins, OK USA]\nI can't
EXTD=add much to the many complimentary reviews of this CD other than
EXTD=to point out that it is only part of the package. The television
EXTD=special, "John Denver's Rocky Mountain Christmas" aired around C
EXTD=hristmas time of 1973 (or maybe'74). It featured a transparent do
EXTD=me in a snowy meadow up in the Rockies. Most of the songs were pe
EXTD=rformed there in front of a live audience of friends and relative
EXTD=s. It even featured a few bits from a then quite young Steve Mart
EXTD=in. There was lots of fantastic footage of the changing of the se
EXTD=asons in the Rockies and great snow and Christmas scenes througho
EXTD=ut. The final section is a Christmas mini concert at night in a s
EXTD=now shower with everyone snug and warm in the dome that is glowin
EXTD=g with Christmas lights. Pure magic! It was one of the most down-
EXTD=to-earth, purely honest Christmas specials I have ever seen. I re
EXTD=member it so well because I video taped it on an old (new then) r
EXTD=eel to reel video tape recorder. I have since transfered it to VH
EXTD=S and watch it several times each Christmas season. I sure wish i
EXTD=t would be re-released on DVD as the CD has been. See it if you c
EXTD=an, but definitely buy the CD and hear it this Christmas.\n\n\nAM

EXTD=23, 2001\nReviewer: historyone "historyone" (Republic of Texas, U
EXTD=SA]\nThis is an excellent CD and one of the best Christmas record
EXTD=ings made in the last 30 or so years. I remember watching John De
EXTD=nver's Christmas specials when I was a kid and I really enjoyed t
EXTD=he Christmas Carols he sang on them. I was looking for a long tim
EXTD=e for his Christmas CD but wasn't able to find it. What a nice su
EXTD=prise it was when I was able to find it on here and I received it
EXTD=during the Christmas season. It really made the season more enjo
EXTD=yable and I was able to remember back to my Christmas's of youth.
EXTD=\nMy favorite song on the CD is "Coventry Carol" it is an old En
EXTD=glish Carol and has that feeling of being in London during the 18
EXTD=th or 19th century. Another favorite is "Oh Holy Night", and Denv
EXTD=er sings it oustandingly. But every songs on this CD from "Aspeng
EXTD=low" to "Dreamland Express" are wonderful to listen to over and o
EXTD=ver again during the Christmas season.\n\nI highly recommend this
EXTD=CD to all who love good Christmas Carols and those who enjoy the
EXTD=singing voice of the late John Denver.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER

EXTD=sic fan\nAll I have to do is hear the first few notes of "Aspengl
EXTD=ow" and I can see, smell, and feel every Christmas from my childh
EXTD=ood. My parents played this album so often that it soon became mo
EXTD=stly pops and scratches, but that didn't matter. Hearing John Den
EXTD=ver's soft, warm voice wrap around these songs instantly reminded
EXTD=me of the peace and joy that Christmastime is really about. Give
EXTD=this album a listen, and get in touch with the spirit of Christm

EXTD=From John Denver!, August 21, 2000\nReviewer: Barron Laycock "Lab
EXTD=radorman" (Temple, New Hampshire United States]\nThis wonderful a
EXTD=lbum by John Denver is one of my favorite Christmas albums, and f
EXTD=or good reason. The inimitable Mr Denver is in top form here, and
EXTD=his selection of songs and arrangements is perfect. Many of thes
EXTD=e songs are timeless, and a few like "Aspenglow" and "A Baby Just
EXTD=Like You" are very special songs written by John himself. Johns 
EXTD=voice is in perfect pitch as he soars through "Silver Bells", "Aw
EXTD=ay In A Manger", "Silent Night", and a breath-taking "Oh, Holy Ni
EXTD=ght". He seems so very much at peace and happy as he sings all th
EXTD=e songs on this album, and it is a comfort to those of us who con
EXTD=sidered him a special person and entertainer to still have him ar
EXTD=ound with wonderful seasonal albums like this as well as all the 
EXTD=more popular albums he left behind as his personal legacy to a gr

EXTD=l have the LP, purchased back in the 70s. The best track in my op

EXTD=ite Christmas albums, September 22, 1998\nReviewer: A music fan\n
EXTD=I've always counted this as the cream of the crop of Denver album
EXTD=s. On the traditional songs, he gives each melody new life. I esp
EXTD=ecially like his quiet "Silver Bells", punctuated by his understa
EXTD=ted guitar and distant jingle bells. Still, it's the original son
EXTD=gs that stand out. My favorite is "Aspenglow," which interweaves 
EXTD=guitars and homesick portraits of the good life in the mountains.
EXTD=John sings a lovely Christmas lullaby to his adopted son (just a
EXTD=n infant at the time) in another song. "Please Daddy don't get dr
EXTD=unk this Christmas" is included, and its sadness is diminished by
EXTD=the next song, a hopping version of "Rudolph the red nosed reind
EXTD=eer." This album has a lot of things to celebrate. 5 stars!
