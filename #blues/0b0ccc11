EXTD=REVIEW:  "Take a Look" Aretha Franklin has simply been one of the
EXTD=greatest singers of the modern generation, and whether bringing 
EXTD=her powerful, passionate voice to bear on gospel standards, songs
EXTD=from the Great American Songbook, jazz standards, pop ditties, o
EXTD=r deep Southern soul and R&B, she has always had the presence -- 
EXTD=much like Ray Charles -- to make anything she touches unmistakabl
EXTD=y hers. Franklin began her career in gospel when she was still a 
EXTD=teenager, and her amazing vocal talents, coupled with her fine pi
EXTD=ano playing, marked her as a once-in-a-lifetime kind of artist, q
EXTD=ualities very apparent to legendary talent scout John Hammond, wh
EXTD=o signed her to Columbia Records. The problem Hammond and Columbi
EXTD=a immediately ran into, though, was how to best present that spir
EXTD=ited voice to the secular pop world. Between 1960 and 1969 (her f
EXTD=irst release for the label was actually in 1961), Columbia tried 
EXTD=Franklin in a variety of styles and settings, and if none of them
EXTD=exactly caught fire the way her legendary later sides for Atlant
EXTD=ic Records would, they still allowed Franklin to explore a lot of
EXTD=avenues, and she was too good a singer not to be at least memora
EXTD=ble in all of them. This wonderful box set includes CDs of Frankl
EXTD=in's seven full-length albums for the label, two CDs of her work 
EXTD=with producers Bobby Scott (in 1963) and Clyde Otis (in 1964), a 
EXTD=CD of singles produced by Bob Johnston, plus rarities that were s
EXTD=weetened and released after Franklin left Columbia for Atlantic a
EXTD=nd a DVD featuring Franklin performing several songs at the piano
EXTD=on The Steve Allen Show in 1964. It's a tremendous set, and it p
EXTD=ortrays an artist working her own way toward how to best present 
EXTD=herself to the world. We all know she got there.  -- Steve Legget
