EXTD=Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985 was a historically significant Stevi
EXTD=e Ray Vaughan recording in purely audio form, but the 2004 DVD re
EXTD=lease ups the ante by providing video footage of both sets. The 1
EXTD=982 show is essentially the show that got his career started. He 
EXTD=met both Jackson Browne and David Bowie after his set, and they w
EXTD=ere so impressed that Browne volunteered use of his studio (for f
EXTD=ree!) for Stevie to record what would become his debut album, and
EXTD=Bowie recruited him as lead guitarist for the Let's Dance album 
EXTD=and tour (alas, the tour was not to be). However, not everyone wa
EXTD=s so impressed. In fact, there are choruses of boos that follow n
EXTD=early every tune. Vaughan was basically a nobody at the time, pla
EXTD=ying very electric blues at the end of a mostly acoustic program.
EXTD=But he had done enough bar gigs to completely rise above it, and
EXTD=he plays with the passion and hunger of a young musician getting
EXTD=his big chance. He's not really an engaging frontman at this poi
EXTD=nt in his career, but man, can he play that guitar. And he simply
EXTD=never lets up. Even at this stage, his tone and style are pretty
EXTD=close to fully formed, and it's easy to see how he could become 
EXTD=the guitar hero he ended up being. \n\nThe 1985 show is quite a c
EXTD=ontrast. Vaughan had become a star, and it shows in so many ways.
EXTD=He had developed more of a stage persona, with showier moves and
EXTD=infinitely more presence as a frontman. He's also dressed to the
EXTD=hilt, looking like some sort of '80s cowboy-pimp with a ridiculo
EXTD=us hat, multiple scarfs, and gigantic earring. Heck, even Whipper
EXTD=Layton is sporting fancier '80s pants and a big earring, and Tom
EXTD=my Shannon's hat is more extravagant than the 1982 show as well. 
EXTD=Double Trouble also now included Reese Wynans on keyboards, which
EXTD=, along with Vaughan's addition of a wah-wah pedal, really expand
EXTD=ed the sound. Vaughan has many fiery moments on this set as well,
EXTD=but he also loses focus during several solos, and seems more tha
EXTD=n content to share or even hand over the spotlight to fellow Texa
EXTD=s guitar legend Johnny Copeland. Vaughan seems a bit worn out, an
EXTD=d it wouldn't be long before he got sober. Even so, there are cle
EXTD=ar moments of brilliance and this time the audience is fully behi
EXTD=nd him. Live at Montreux 1982 and 1985 is a vital document for fans
EXTD=, showing the raw ingredients that would make him a star, then co
EXTD=mparing it to what happened once he got there. The video is great
EXTD=, with multiple angles throughout (except for the encore of the 1
EXTD=985 set) and there are many excellent close-ups of his playing. I
EXTD=t's a great look at the rise of one of rock's most revered guitar
EXTD=players.  -- Sean Westergaard\n\n\nAmazon.com Editorial Review (
EXTD=2CD+2DVD Edition]\nIt's not the familiar, fiery playing of Stevie
EXTD=Ray Vaughan that tips listeners off that this set's first disc h
EXTD=as captured an extraordinary moment in modern blues history - it's
EXTD=the jarring, rising chorus of boos that accompanies it. As with 
EXTD=previous musicians as disparate as Dylan and Stravinsky, Vaughan'
EXTD=s willful tweaking of staid genre conventions initially infuriate
EXTD=d purists. Though few could have imagined it at the time, Vaughan
EXTD=and company's July 17, 1982, show at the Montreux Jazz Festival 
EXTD=(included here in its entirety) ignited not only a brilliant care
EXTD=er, but a widespread revival of the blues as well.\n\nDavid Bowie
EXTD=was there that night, but he was not booing. He secured the Texa
EXTD=s guitarist's services for his smash Let's Dance album on the spo
EXTD=t, nearly a year before Vaughan would make his major-label debut.
EXTD=\n\nStraight from the Austin club scene, the band displays their 
EXTD=nervous energy in a set that contains several previously unreleas
EXTD=ed/rare gems from SRV's early repertoire, including the Hound Dog
EXTD=Taylor romp "Give Me Back My Wig." By the time of this set's sec
EXTD=ond disc, recorded just three years later, SRV was a worldwide st
EXTD=ar, the boos had turned to rousing cheers, and Vaughan's nervousn
EXTD=ess was replaced by an incendiary swagger he seemed all too happy
EXTD=to push into the crowd's faces. With the band (drummer Chris Lay
EXTD=ton, bassist Tommy Shannon) now augmented by Reese Wynans on orga
EXTD=n and guest guitarist Johnny Copeland sitting in on "Tin Pan Alle
EXTD=y," the triumphant show (11 of the 15 songs are included here) ce
EXTD=ntered on the cream of SRV's first three studio albums. While som
EXTD=e of these tracks have found their way onto other releases (Live 
EXTD=Alive, Blues at Sunrise), the show's "Scuttle Buttin'," "Voodoo C
EXTD=hile," "Gone Home," and "Couldn't Stand the Weather" are released
EXTD=here for the first time. The set's comprehensive liner notes con
EXTD=tain new commentary from the band's Shannon and Layton, David Bow
EXTD=ie, early confidant Darryl Pitt, and many quotes from the guitar 
EXTD=legend himself. All history lessons should be this riveting. --Je

EXTD=If you have even a passing interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's peerl
EXTD=ess mastery of urban blues guitar, you must own Live at Montreux 
EXTD=1982 and 1985. Spaced almost exactly three years apart, these conce
EXTD=rts (60 and 93 minutes, respectively) represent the Texan blues g
EXTD=od at his fiery best, with Double Trouble (drummer Chris Layton a
EXTD=nd bassist Tommy Shannon) laying the solid foundation upon which 
EXTD=SRV built a Fender-driven sound as fierce as it was perfectly ref
EXTD=ined. The '82 show was truly "success in disguise," because despi
EXTD=te booing from a festival audience lulled by a day of acoustic bl
EXTD=ues, and the stunned dejection that SRV felt after persevering th
EXTD=rough a uncompromising set, this was the turning point in SRV's c
EXTD=areer, leading to post-show encounters with Jackson Browne and Da
EXTD=vid Bowie, who proved instrumental in bringing Stevie's music to 
EXTD=an appreciative global audience.\n\nWhen Stevie, Chris, and Tommy
EXTD=returned to Switzerland three years later, with organist Reese W
EXTD=ynans adding rich new dimension to the Double Trouble sound, the 
EXTD=Montreux crowd was primed for a rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubil
EXTD=ant response is a joyous thing to witness. One of SRV's favorite 
EXTD=bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appears for a three-song triumph in a 
EXTD=set that's uniformly superior and ecstatically energized. Basic t
EXTD=hree-camera coverage is all you need, although guitar students--f
EXTD=or whom this DVD is a godsend--will surely wish for more emphasis
EXTD=on SRV's picking and fretwork. Recording quality is superb in th
EXTD=e Montreux tradition, with 5.1-channel remixes that surpass the o
EXTD=riginal masters. A splendid 23-minute documentary features retros
EXTD=pective interviews with Layton, Shannon, Browne, and John Mayer, 
EXTD=and the accompanying booklet includes a heartfelt reminiscence fr
EXTD=om Bowie. Stevie Ray may be gone, but Live at Montreux ensures th
EXTD=at his gold-standard legacy will endure. --Jeff Shannon\n\n
