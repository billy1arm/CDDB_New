EXTD=lbums, Led Zeppelin issued a relentless assault of heavy blues an
EXTD=d rockabilly riffs, and Led Zeppelin III provided the band with t
EXTD=he necessary room to grow musically. While there are still a hand
EXTD=ful of metallic rockers, III is built on a folky, acoustic founda
EXTD=tion which gives the music extra depth. And even the rockers aren
EXTD='t as straightforward as before -- the galloping "Immigrant Song"
EXTD=is powered by Plant's banshee wail, "Celebration Day" turns blue
EXTD=s-rock inside out with a warped slide guitar riff, and "Out on th
EXTD=e Tiles" lumbers along with a tricky, multi-part riff. Neverthele
EXTD=ss, the heart of the album lies on the second side, when the band
EXTD=delves deeply into English folk. "Gallows Pole" updates a tradit
EXTD=ional tune with a menacing flair, and "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp" is an in
EXTD=fectious acoustic romp, while "That's the Way" and "Tangerine" ar
EXTD=e shimmering songs with graceful country flourishes. The band has
EXTD=n't left the blues behind, but the twisted bottleneck blues of "H
EXTD=ats Off to (Roy) Harper" actually outstrips the epic "Since I've 
EXTD=Been Loving You," which is the only time Zeppelin sounds a bit se
EXTD=t in their ways. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nAmazon.com Edito
EXTD=rial Review\nAfter plundering the Yardbirds' legacy and Willie Di
EXTD=xon (among others) for their blues-riff-heavy first two albums, J
EXTD=immy Page and company surprised many listeners with the strong ac
EXTD=oustic/folk sensibility displayed on III. Page aficionados should
EXTD=n't have been caught off guard - the guitarist had toyed with simi
EXTD=lar sensibilities and modalities during his brief tenure with the
EXTD=Yardbirds (most notably "White Summer" from the Little Games alb
EXTD=um). Ever the creative thieves, Zep kick off the album by nicking
EXTD=the riff from "Bali Ha'i" no less, with Robert Plant wailing it 
EXTD=to punctuate the thundering FM warhorse "Immigrant Song." Even ot
EXTD=her electric rockers like "Celebration Day" and "Out on the Tiles
EXTD=" have an inventive, offbeat musicality to them that suggest the 
EXTD=band was already wary of stereotyping. But it's the decidedly mel
EXTD=lower acoustic groove of the album's latter half that's the news 
EXTD=here, from the graceful beauty of "That's the Way" and "Tangerine
EXTD=" to the raw, folksy charm of "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp," "Hats Off (to R
EXTD=oy Harper)," and the traditional "Gallows Pole." --Jerry McCulley

EXTD=tic whispers that would run through much of ZEPPELIN IV have thei
EXTD=r folk/blues antecedents here (the lambent "That's the Way," the 
EXTD=earthy "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"), the results of the band's creative en
EXTD=campment in a woodland dwelling. At the same time, the heavier tr
EXTD=acks are unprecedented in their ferocious swagger. Robert Plant's
EXTD=bone-chilling battle cry and the band's savage riffing on "The I
EXTD=mmigrant Song" do full justice to the song's Viking imagery, and 
EXTD=it's easy to believe that the "hammer of the gods" Plant sings ab

EXTD=Q (11/01/1994]\n\n\nROLLING STONE REVIEW\nI keep nursing this lov
EXTD=e-hate attitude toward Led Zeppelin. Partly from genuine interest
EXTD=and mostly indefensible hopes, in part from the conviction that 
EXTD=nobody that crass could be all that bad, I turn to each fresh alb
EXTD=um expecting -- what? Certainly not subtle echoes of the monolith
EXTD=ic Yardbirds, or authentic blues experiments, or even much variet
EXTD=y. Maybe it's just that they seem like the ultimate Seventies Cal
EXTD=f of Gold.\n\nThe Zep, of all bands surviving, are today -- their
EXTD=music is as ephemeral as Marvel comix, and as vivid as an old Te
EXTD=chnicolor cartoon. It doesn't challenge anybody's intelligence or
EXTD=sensibilities, relying instead on a pat visceral impact that wil
EXTD=l insure absolute stardom for many moons to come. Their albums re
EXTD=fine the crude public tools of all dull white blues bands into so
EXTD=mething awesome in its very insensitive grossness, like a Cecil B
EXTD=DeMille epic. If I rely so much on visual and filmic metaphors,
EXTD=it's because they apply so exactly. I've never made a Zep show, 
EXTD=but friends (most of them the type, admittedly, who will listen- 
EXTD=to anything so long's it's loud and they're destroyed) describe a
EXTD=thunderous, near-undifferentiated tidal wave of sound that doesn
EXTD='t engross but envelops to snuff any possible distraction.\n\nThe
EXTD=ir third album deviates little from the track laid by the first t
EXTD=wo, even though they go acoustic on several numbers. Most of the 
EXTD=acoustic stuff sounds like standard Zep graded down decibelwise, 
EXTD=and the heavy blitzes could've been outtakes from Zeppelin II. In
EXTD=fact, when I first heard the album my main impression was the co
EXTD=nsistent anonymity of most of the songs -- no one could mistake t
EXTD=he band, but no gimmicks stand out with any special outrageousnes
EXTD=s, as did the great, gleefully absurd Orangutang Plant-cum-wheezi
EXTD=ng guitar freak-out that made "Whole Lotta Love" such a pulp clas
EXTD=sic. "Immigrant Song" comes closest, with its bulldozer rhythms a
EXTD=nd Bobby Plant's double-tracked wordless vocal croonings echoing 
EXTD=behind the main vocal like some cannibal chorus wailing in the in
EXTD=fernal light of a savage fertility rite. What's great about it, t
EXTD=hough, the Zep's special genius, is that the whole effect is so u
EXTD=tterly two-dimensional and unreal. You could play it, as I did, w
EXTD=hile watching a pagan priestess performing the ritual dance of Ka
EXTD=before the flaming sacrificial altar in Fire Maidens of Outer Sp
EXTD=ace with the TV sound turned off. And believe me, the Zep made my
EXTD=blood throb to those jungle rhythms even more frenziedly.\n\nUnf
EXTD=ortunately, precious little of Z III's remaining hysteria is as u
EXTD=seful or as effectively melodramatic. "Friends" has a fine bitter
EXTD=acoustic lead, but gives itself over almost entirely to monotono
EXTD=usly shrill Plant breast-beatings. Rob, give a listen to Iggy Sto
EXTD=oge.\n\n"Celebration Day" and "Out On the Tiles" are production-l
EXTD=ine Zep churners that no fan could fault and no one else could ev
EXTD=en hear without an effort. "Since I've Been Loving You" represent
EXTD=s the obligatory slow and lethally dull seven-minute blues jam, a
EXTD=nd "Hats Off to (Roy) Harper" dedicates a bottleneck-&-shimmering
EXTD=echo-chamber vocal salad to a British minstrel who, I am told, l
EXTD=eans more towards the music-hall tradition.\n\nMuch of the rest, 
EXTD=after a couple of listenings to distinguish between songs, is not
EXTD=bad at all, because the disc Zeppelin are at least creative enou
EXTD=gh to apply an occasional pleasing fillip to their uninspiring ma
EXTD=terial, and professional enough to keep all their recorded work r
EXTD=elatively clean and clear -- you can hear all the parts, which is
EXTD=more than you can say for many of their peers.\n\nFinally I must
EXTD=mention a song called "That's the Way," because it's the first s
EXTD=ong they've ever done that has truly moved me. Son of a gun, it's
EXTD=beautiful. Above a very simple and appropriately everyday acoust
EXTD=ic riff, Plant sings a touching picture of two youngsters who can
EXTD=no longer be playmates because one's parents and peers disapprov
EXTD=e of the other because of long hair and being generally from "the
EXTD=dark side of town." The vocal is restrained for once -- in fact,
EXTD=Plant's intonations are as plaintively gentle as some of the Ras
EXTD=cals' best ballad work -- and a perfectly modulated electronic dr
EXTD=one wails in the background like melancholy harbor scows as the w
EXTD=ords fall soft as sooty snow: "And yesterday I saw you standing b
EXTD=y the river - I read those tears that filled your eyes - And all 
EXTD=the fish that lay in dirty water dying - Had they got you hypnoti
EXTD=zed?" Beautiful, and strangely enough Zep. As sage Berry declared
EXTD=eons ago, it shore goes to show you never can tell.   (Posted: N
