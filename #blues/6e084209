EXTD=The Griffintown Jug Addicts\nhttp://www.danlivingstone.com/jug.ht
EXTD=ml\n\nDrawing inspiration from 'jug' bands of the 1930s and 40s (
EXTD=a blues style mixing ragtime, swing and folk music), the group re
EXTD=creates the ambiance of that lost era in music when simplicity a
EXTD=nd fun were paramount to the making of music. This music, decepti
EXTD=vely simple in nature and it themes, is often complex in its poly
EXTD=phony and rhythm and can directly be linked to the beginning of s
EXTD=wing, and much later rock'n'roll. The simplicity is demonstrated 
EXTD=by the high preponderance of homemade instruments such as the was
EXTD=htub bass, washboard, jugs and cigar-box guitars. The Griffintown
EXTD=Jug Addicts reflects and re-invents the traditions with an empha
EXTD=sis on vocal harmony and swing.\nDan Livingstone\n\nFingerstyle b
EXTD=lues guitarist Dan Livingstone has been receiving acclaim from mu
EXTD=sicians and audiences alike as an exceptional guitar player and a
EXTD=n engaging performer - a bluesman to watch. Whether playing rags,
EXTD=swing, blues or spirituals, his expressive style marks him as a 
EXTD=musician with "big ears" and a passion for the authentic. Born an
EXTD=d raised on the west coast of Canada, Livingstone now makes his h
EXTD=ome in Montreal where he regularly plays the clubs around that ci
EXTD=ty. In the Fall of 2004, he toured Europe, playing the clubs and 
EXTD=concert halls of Norway, Germany and France. His appearances and 
EXTD=concerts across Canada over the last decade have included festiva
EXTD=ls in the Maritimes, Prairies and Quebec, mainstaging at both Rim
EXTD=ouski en Blues and Carleton International Blues Festival, the Pan
EXTD=Am Games, International Jazz Festival of Montreal, and the Islan
EXTD=ds Folk Festival on Vancouver Island where audiences ranked him a
EXTD=s one of the top performers of the weekend. In 2008, he embarked 
EXTD=upon a tour that took him to China, Ireland, France, Belgium with
EXTD=brief stopovers in Greece, N. Ireland and the USA. With nearly 7
EXTD=00 shows in the past five years Livingstone has established himse
EXTD=lf as a veteran performer and raconteur.\n\nLivingstone is inspir
EXTD=ed by the magic of the Piedmont, Delta and Texas blues traditions
EXTD=, and one of his aims as a musician is to immerse his audience in
EXTD=the music of Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Fred Mc
EXTD=Dowell, and Robert Johnson. Livingstone's originals-- very popula
EXTD=r with his fans -- reflect a mix of these influences as well as a
EXTD=highly developed, lyrical style.\n\nLivingstone's debut CD was r
EXTD=eleased in June 2000 and is entitled, Dan Livingstone.\nDominic D
EXTD=esjardins\n\nGrowing up Trois-Rivières, Dominic Desjardins' first
EXTD=passion was jazz guitar. But it was while studying guitar at the
EXTD=Cegep du Vieux Montreal that he discovered another great instrum
EXTD=ent of the jazz era: the tenor banjo. Within a very short while, 
EXTD=the banjo became his principal instrument. Desjardin is currently
EXTD=studying music at Concordia University, but also performs as a b
EXTD=anjo and guitar player as well as arranger for several bands, inc
EXTD=luding the Early Jazz Band, the Jazz Knights, and with Dan Living
EXTD=stone and Jerome Dupuis-Cloutier.\nJulia Narveson\n\nWorld Champi
EXTD=on Jug-Tubbist Julia Narveson hails from Waterloo, Ontario where 
EXTD=she was raised in household of music afficianados. Julia has been
EXTD=playing music for over 20 years on violin, double bass ukelele, 
EXTD=saxophones, madolin, saw, jug and of course washtub. Played a who
EXTD=le lot in the classical realm, and branched out from there. Miss 
EXTD=Narveson has been living in Montreal for 5 years now, playing mai
EXTD=nly folk/country/old time music with such bands as Lake Of Stew a
EXTD=mong others. Her incredible groove and intonation is the keel of 
EXTD=the Griifintown Jug Addicts.\nBrad Levia\n\nOriginally from Chate
EXTD=auguay Quebec, 'Washboard' Brad Levia has played bass, drums and 
EXTD=guitar in numerous punk and rock bands around Ontario and Quebec.
EXTD=In 2004, he decided to retire from the loud, electric genres and
EXTD=began a solo show as 'Uncle Daddy', a country/rockabilly one ban
EXTD=d band. He is also a founding member of Lake of Stew- a 7 piece a
EXTD=coustic folk/country/bluegrass group with a heavy emphasis on voc
EXTD=al harmony. In tandem to Lake of Stew he also maintains a 'skiffl
EXTD=e' duo with Julia Narveson.\nBernadette Fortin\n\nMontréal born a
EXTD=nd raised, this prodigious fiddle player and vocalist is the late
EXTD=st addition to the band. After growing up in a family of musician
EXTD=s, where she honed her fiddle skills, Fortin moved on to world be
EXTD=at and eventually the blues. Recreating blues/Cajun fiddle with e
EXTD=xtraordinary versatility, she breathes new life into this almost 
EXTD=forgotten genre. Taking inspiration from such fiddle greats as Jo
EXTD=e Venuti, Harry Choates, "Stuff" Smith, and Johnny Gimble, Fortin
EXTD=is establishing herself as someone to watch closely in the Montr
EXTD=eal blues community. With her dark contralto vocals and expressiv
EXTD=e fiddle work, she fills out the top end. \n
