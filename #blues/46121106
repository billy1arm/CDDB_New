EXTD=roup\n\nOriginally Released October 6, 2009\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW:
EXTD=In just over a decade, John Coltrane passed through three (some
EXTD=would say four) distinct artistic phases, basically separated by
EXTD=which label he was signed to at the time. In only two years on A
EXTD=tlantic, he catapulted hard bop forward, imported influences from
EXTD=Indian and North African music, and worked with Ornette Coleman'
EXTD=s backing band. Upon signing to Impulse! in 1961, he began a six-
EXTD=year stretch of relentlessly experimental studio work, with his "
EXTD=classic quartet" and numerous other musicians including Eric Dolp
EXTD=hy, Rashied Ali, Pharoah Sanders, and his second wife, Alice. But
EXTD=his early recordings, made for the Prestige label between 1955 a
EXTD=nd 1957, are both voluminous and revelatory. Side Steps is the th
EXTD=ird and final box in a series that has separated Coltrane's work 
EXTD=for the label into albums on which he was the leader, albums reco
EXTD=rded with him as part of a larger group (the "Prestige All-Stars"
EXTD=), and discs on which he was a mere sideman. (The albums he recor
EXTD=ded with the Miles Davis Quintet have their own box.) The five di
EXTD=scs of Side Steps contain 43 tracks originally released under the
EXTD=leadership of players like Elmo Hope, Tadd Dameron, Mal Waldron,
EXTD=Red Garland, and Gene Ammons, plus "Tenor Madness," the saxophon
EXTD=ist's lone in-studio encounter with Sonny Rollins, and all find C
EXTD=oltrane playing his part, never truly dominating proceedings but 
EXTD=always stepping up when his moment comes. In the mid-'50s, Coltra
EXTD=ne had yet to develop the "sheets of sound" technique of worrying
EXTD=away endlessly at a chord - instead, his solos hold to a bluesy, 
EXTD=bop-derived style, with a rich command of the horn's full range, 
EXTD=though he tends to keep himself in the lower to middle register. 
EXTD=Bob Weinstock, owner of Prestige Records, tended to book "blowing
EXTD=sessions" rather than let artists come up with an album's worth 
EXTD=of solid new material that would work as a cohesive artistic stat
EXTD=ement, and he always attempted to get as much material as possibl
EXTD=e from a single studio date, so there are a lot of standards on t
EXTD=hese discs, and relatively few originals (by the leaders or the s
EXTD=idemen). Also, many of the performances are quite lengthy, with t
EXTD=en of them passing the ten-minute mark and "All Mornin' Long," on
EXTD=which Coltrane and Donald Byrd augment Red Garland's trio, comin

EXTD=pletes Prestige Trilogy, 11.23.2009 \nBy  D. Berryman (Minneapoli
EXTD=s, MN United States]\n\nWhat do give to the fan who has everythin
EXTD=g? A devoted John Coltrane fan may have every one his records, bu
EXTD=t John Coltrane also made outstanding contributions as a side man
EXTD=on other artists' records. Side Steps is the third and final set
EXTD=in the John Coltrane series of remastered studio sessions for Pr
EXTD=estige Records. This collection is valuable not only because it d
EXTD=ocuments some of Coltrane's pivotal session work, but also becaus
EXTD=e it contains outstanding music from one of the most fertile peri
EXTD=ods in jazz performed by some of its finest practitioners. \n\nTh
EXTD=ere are ten LP albums represented in Side Steps, some in their en
EXTD=tirety. The LP titles are Elmo Hope Sextet: Informal Jazz - Sonny 
EXTD=Rollins: 'Tenor Madness' - Tadd Dameron: 'Mating Call'' Mal Waldro
EXTD=n: 'Mal/2' and 'The Dealers', the Red Garland Quintet: 'All Morni
EXTD=n' Long', 'Soul Junction', 'High Pressure' and 'Dig It!' - Gene Am
EXTD=mons' All Stars: 'The Big Sound and Groove Blues' - and the Ray Dr
EXTD=aper Quintet: 'New Jazz'. Other than Tenor Madness, these are not
EXTD=very high-profile jazz albums and perhaps, because of that, they
EXTD=are rarely heard. This makes this remastered set an excellent se
EXTD=lection for the Coltrane collector or anyone interested in late '
EXTD=50s hard-bop. It's nice to hear something new, even if it is 50 y
EXTD=ears old. \n\nIn Side Steps the 43 tracks are presented in the or
EXTD=der they were recorded, rather than as they were released on LP a
EXTD=lbums. The most famous track in this set documents a historic mom
EXTD=ent with Coltrane trading solos with Sonny Rollins on the 12-minu
EXTD=te title track of Rollins' 'Tenor Madness'. These two tenor titan
EXTD=s only recorded together this one time and only a single track, d
EXTD=espite the fact that they greatly admired each other's work. \n\n
EXTD=A particular favorite track of mine is Mal Waldron's poignant arr
EXTD=angement of "Don't Explain" on disc 2 from Waldron's LP, Mal/2. I
EXTD=t begins slowly with the bass playing pedal point on 2 and 4 with
EXTD=light drums and Donald Byrd's trumpet soulfully playing the melo
EXTD=dy, punctuated by dissonant piercing tones from the saxophones. O
EXTD=n the bridge, Coltrane's tenor blends beautifully with Jackie McL
EXTD=ean's alto in harmony. Byrd lays down a bluesy solo and Coltrane 
EXTD=follows, managing to squeeze a dazzling amount of music into a fe
EXTD=w bars without altering the mood. The head arrangement is repeate
EXTD=d and the tune ends as it began with bass on 2 and 4 and light dr
EXTD=ums. \n\nAnother interesting combination is Coltrane playing with
EXTD=Ray Draper on tuba. The contrast between the sounds of the instr
EXTD=uments is striking, particularly when they play in unison, and th
EXTD=e tuba provides a rich depth of sound for the tenor to solo over.
EXTD=\n\nThis also is the time when Coltrane started developing his s
EXTD=o-called "sheets of sound" and Side Steps contains many marvellou
EXTD=s examples of these extremely dense improvisational lines, consis
EXTD=ting of high speed arpeggios and scales played in rapid successio
EXTD=n over the changes. A good example is his blistering solo on Char
EXTD=lie Parker's "Billies Bounce" on disc 4 from the Red Garland Quin
EXTD=tet's 'Dig It!' album. \n\nTo document this collection. Side Step
EXTD=s comes with a booklet that contains photos from the recording se
EXTD=ssions and reproductions of all of the original album cover art a
EXTD=s well as all of the original LP liner notes by Ira Gitler, Nat H
EXTD=entoff, Joe Goldberg, and Michael Gold. The booklet also includes
