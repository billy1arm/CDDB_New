EXTD=alifornia, USA]\nThe "Valotte" single came out when I was 10 year
EXTD=s old and I remember making fun of it at the time ("sitting on a 
EXTD=PEBBLE by the river"? Ouch!). Years later I ran across this album
EXTD=and thought I'd give it a try since, all kidding aside, the titl
EXTD=e track is great. To my surprise, the rest of the album is nearly
EXTD=as good. The first side (in vinyl terms) is the most solid. "O.K
EXTD=For You" is an awesome rocker as is "Well I Don't Know." "Space
EXTD=" is beautiful and sounds like it could be "Valotte II." "On the 
EXTD=Phone" bugs me because it sounds too much like "If This Is It" by
EXTD=Huey Lewis and the News.\n\nThe second half is weaker. It starts
EXTD=with the other top ten single "Too Late For Goodbyes" which, eve
EXTD=n though it is only 3 1/2 minutes, seems like it goes on too long
EXTD=After one verse and chorus it runs out of ideas. The rest of th
EXTD=e side offers some diverse sounds: a tiny bit of gospel in "Lonel
EXTD=y," a touch of Latin horn in "Say You're Wrong." "Jesse" is defin
EXTD=itely the best and most interesting track on side 2. It ends with
EXTD=the slow, yet upbeat 2-minute "Let Me Be." Together, these songs
EXTD=make for a very enjoyable album. Julian Lennon definitely inheri
EXTD=ted plenty of songwriting talent from his father and, only 4 year
EXTD=s after John Lennon's shocking murder, Valotte was a mature-sound
EXTD=ing tribute to those talents. That Julian was only 21 at the time
EXTD=makes this album particularly amazing. Now I feel guilty for mak
EXTD=ing fun of him back in the day.\n\nHalf.com Album Credits\nPhil R

EXTD=ure and the strikingly conversational first line "Sitting on the 
EXTD=doorstep of a house I can't afford," Julian Lennon's debut single
EXTD="Valotte" is an understated, melancholy gem. Equally blessed and
EXTD=cursed by both looking and sounding uncannily like his late fath
EXTD=er John, Lennon's first album was greeted with much more scrutiny
EXTD=than that of the average 21-year-old singer/songwriter. Because 
EXTD=Julian Lennon was unfairly compared to the elder Lennon and unwil
EXTD=lingly adopted as a real-life mascot by aging baby boomers eager 
EXTD=to relive their memories of Beatlemania, the often excellent musi
EXTD=c contained on VALOTTE often seemed somehow beside the point in t
EXTD=he intense media coverage that followed the album's release. This
EXTD=is a shame, because in addition to the title track and two other
EXTD=excellent hit singles, "Say You're Wrong" and the reggae-tinged 
EXTD="Too Late for Goodbyes," VALOTTE contains a handful of gems like 
EXTD=the heart-wrenching "Well I Don't Know" and "OK for You."
