EXTD=m's one live track, a cover of "Livin' for You" that's marred onl

EXTD=of guests, range from arena stratospherics to whispery folkisms - 
EXTD=in the fashion of Phil Spector, Scholz is more concerned with ble

EXTD=w\nThere's something very curious about Boston's fifth album--and
EXTD=the road the band has traveled from arena-rock heights to its cu
EXTD=rrent less-than-lofty status. Here, after all, is a band--really,
EXTD=guitarist-studio wunderkind Tom Scholz and company--that emerged
EXTD=from nowhere and set sales records with their 1976 self-titled d
EXTD=ebut. Since then, Boston's profile has shrunk with each successiv

EXTD=using much of a stir, but it's a strange creation from Scholz and
EXTD=his crew, which includes Brad Delp, the voice behind "More Than 
EXTD=a Feeling" and "Don't Look Back." Like the Boston of the '70s, th
EXTD=is unit creates polished, epic-scaled rock. Scholz's inimitable i

EXTD=: \nI'm used to waiting eight years between Boston albums, provid
EXTD=ed they satisfy me in the end. And I can safely say that this alb
EXTD=um, while good, was not worth the eight-year wait. If one word ca
EXTD=n describe this album, that word would be imbalanced. I've listen
EXTD=ed to a lot of imbalanced albums over the years, but this is argu
EXTD=ably the most imbalanced album I have EVER heard. Don't get me wr
EXTD=ong, it's good to diversify, but don't forget that a jack of all 
EXTD=trades is a master of none. No album proves that like Corporate A
EXTD=merica. No two songs on this album sound alike, but in a way that
EXTD='s the problem with the album. If you were to listen to these son
EXTD=gs without knowing they were from the same album/band, you'd have
EXTD=no idea they were. For instance, I Had A Good Time (the album's 
EXTD=big hit) harkens back to the band's classic rock sound. Stare Out
EXTD=Your Window sounds like a modern-day pop-style hit. With You, th
EXTD=e song with Kimberly Dahne singing, sounds NOTHING like Boston, b
EXTD=ut more like modern-day singer-songwriter pop music. Many songs a
EXTD=lso hint at an eighties power rock sound. None of these songs are
EXTD=particularly bad, but at the same time, none are particularly ou
EXTD=tstanding either. The band seems to have no sense of musical dire
EXTD=ction here. Is this a bad album? No. Is it a great, classic Bosto
EXTD=n album that was worth the eight-year wait so many long-time fans
EXTD=have grown used to? I'm afraid not. If you're a die-hard Boston 
EXTD=fan you'll want to add this one to your collection. If you're any
EXTD=thing less, pass it by. Oh, and don't get me started on how Tom S
EXTD=cholz bastardized the liner notes with all of his political belie
EXTD=fs.... \n\nEDITION NOTES: \nThere's only one edition of this albu
EXTD=m readily available in America, and it seems to have faded from s
EXTD=tore shelves due to the album not doing very well. Fortunately, b
EXTD=ecause so many fans were disappointed with the album, plenty of c
EXTD=opies are likely to turn up in the budget bins at used record sto
EXTD=res. So it shouldn't be too hard to get used. \n\nOVERALL: \nThis
EXTD=is an imbalanced album, plain and simple. It's a good album, no 
EXTD=questions asked, but defintely the weakest thing the Boston catal
EXTD=ogue has to offer (the wrongfully-maligned Walk On, which didn't 
EXTD=even have Brad Delp, kills this album dead.) The first three Bost
EXTD=on albums are essential to any classic rock collection. Unfortuna
EXTD=tely, I can't say the same for Corporate America. If you're a die
EXTD=hard fan who wants all of the band's output, then by all means p
EXTD=urchase the album. If you're not, don't bother. Final verdict? Go
EXTD=od but not great. Three out of five stars.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER

EXTD=O. "S.O."\nWow...I am ashamed to say I live in the same state as 
EXTD=Tom Scholtz! Tom lives in a fantasyworld where he believes everyo
EXTD=ne 'still' thinks he remains Boston's legacy. Years ago he was ha
EXTD=iled as a young genius and the driving force behind this band. Bu
EXTD=t no more. Tom has become an unimportant figure. Brad Delp is the
EXTD=only reason I gave this album a chance...and Brad Delp is the on
EXTD=ly glimmer of hope on this, otherwise, disappointing piece of mus
EXTD=ic. I Had A Good Time and the other songs that Brad sings on are 
EXTD=the only things worth listening to on this album. Forget the rest
EXTD=Scholtz apparently does not care what his future musical legacy
EXTD=will be. I have news for him....he has no legacy. Brad Delp has 
EXTD=become the figurehead, the draw, the symbol of this band. Brad De
EXTD=lp merits our respect. (And Brad is a humble and genuinely good m
EXTD=an to boot.) Tom can prance around on stage and think he's 'the m
EXTD=an' in front of all the old codgers and zombies who do not know a
EXTD=ny better....but true-longtime Boston fans know the real deal..it
EXTD='s sad. Very sad. \n\nPS) This is not a slam at the other members
EXTD=of the band.. the Cosmo's, K. Dahme etc. are extremely talented 
EXTD=individuals who would do a wonderful job in the proper setting. N
EXTD=ot this one however. This is supposed to be "Boston". Tom should'

EXTD=REVIEW\nTom Scholtz ignores his musical instincts, October 4, 20
EXTD=04\nReviewer: Gregory S. Standard (Manassas, Va United States]\nW
EXTD=hy is it that after almost thirty years of being a stubborn, non-
EXTD=inclusive musical dictator, whose uncompromising pursuit of uniqu
EXTD=e harmony and melody resulted in two masterpieces, Scholtz has su
EXTD=ddenly decided to be a team player? Moreover, a team player that 
EXTD=has given up way too much creative control (or lost control). The
EXTD=re is exactly ONE song on this CD that sounds like a natural, mod
EXTD=ern progression of the Boston sound: I Had a Good Time. The rest 
EXTD=of the CD is someone else's music. \n\nUnderneath all of the misc
EXTD=ellaneous goop on the CD is the real Tom Scholtz trying to be hea
EXTD=rd. Maybe he has been taken hostage? Or maybe he has been drugged
EXTD=and brain-washed? Or maybe......just maybe....he actually NEEDS 
EXTD=THE REST OF THE ORIGINAL BAND !!!! \n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I
EXTD=have a great deal of respect for Scholtz's past achievements. It
EXTD=is his original technical manipulation of sound and his musical 
EXTD=formula that made most of us Boston fans for life. However, if Sc
EXTD=holtz is going to totally ignore these two important and defining
EXTD=elements, then he has placed himself back into the ranks of the 
EXTD=average and the un-noticeable. A conductor isn't worth much witho
EXTD=ut his orchestra, and let's face it: Tom has driven off most of h
EXTD=is orchestra over the years. Maybe he should have given the origi
EXTD=nal members of Boston as much creative input as he has with his c
EXTD=urrent group of employees. \n\nI read a recent interview in which
EXTD=Scholtz stated that he really fought the instinct to create song
EXTD=s in the same way as he did in the past. BAD IDEA ! Tom, GO WITH 
EXTD=YOUR INSTINCTS ! \n\nI'll bet if Barry Goudreau was involved toda
EXTD=y, many of us wouldn't be bad mouthing the last two Boston projec
EXTD=ts. In fact, people think Tom was the mastermind behind the first
EXTD=two albums. However, the Don't Look Back album contains more Gou
EXTD=dreau influence than Scholtz. Scholtz himself gives credit to Bar
EXTD=ry for coming up with the intros and leads for Don't Look Back an
EXTD=d Long Time (two of my favorite Boston songs). \n\nOf course, Bos
EXTD=ton wouldn't even be an entity today if not for the continued pre
EXTD=sence of Brad Delp (no matter how subdued his role has become). I
EXTD=went to a Corporate America concert two years ago, and I can ass
EXTD=ure you it wasn't to hear Corporate America. I wanted to hear old
EXTD=Boston tunes played by Scholtz and sung by Delp. \n\nBottom line
EXTD=, repair some broken bridges, Tom, and make a REAL MODERN VERSION
EXTD=OF A BOSTON CD. For examples of how to do this, listen to Barry 
EXTD=Goudreau - Brad Delp albums from the past - RTZ, Orion The Hunter
EXTD=, Barry Goudreau's solo album. \n\nPlease, Tom, STOP THE MADNESS 
EXTD=!! We are all getting too old to wait for the real deal. Poor sal
EXTD=es are a result of a disappointed fan base consisting of older - 
EXTD=wiser adults, not bad marketing. \n\nP.S. GIVE BARRY GOUDREAU A C
EXTD=ALL OR DROP HIM AN E-MAIL AT WWW.BARRYGOUDREAU.COM \n\nP.P.S Stop
EXTD=trying to phase out Brad. He's all that remains between you and 
EXTD=obscurity.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nHated it at first, but

EXTD=ainesville, FL United States]\nMy first impression of this album 
EXTD=is that they have sold out and tried to be pop. I was halfway tho
EXTD=ugh the 4th track when I realized that I was listening to a count
EXTD=ry track sung by a women. That's how much I had lost interest in 
EXTD=it.\nSo now I've listened to it a few times over to try to get an
EXTD=objective point of view and here it is....\n\nI can understand a
EXTD=group's evolution in changing direction because "that is the mus
EXTD=ic we made back then and this is the music we like to do now". Ge
EXTD=nesis went through it, lost a lot of fans and gained others. Stil
EXTD=l I think you have to be somewhat true to your style and this alb
EXTD=um takes off on like a 90 degree tangent. At times, the music and
EXTD=singing sound very much like the pop group "Oasis". The group is
EXTD=still pushing vegetarianism and still proclaiming silly things l
EXTD=ike "that siren sound WASN'T a synthesizer, it was a modified Ham
EXTD=mond B3" and at that I'm still wondering what their point is beca
EXTD=use synths seem to be used fairly heavy on this album. I could re
EXTD=ally care less if that rocket ship sound was a Marshall amp with 
EXTD=a bad transistor or those "violins" were FX guitars. At the end o
EXTD=f the day, you are still SYNTHESIZING a sound, so why not use a k
EXTD=eyboard instead of busting your brand new Marshall amp you got fo
EXTD=r Christmas! Anyway....\n\nThe good news, Brad Delp is back for s
EXTD=ome vocals. The bad news is there are no tracks to let his voice 
EXTD=shine. His voice still seems to be there as it comes out momentar
EXTD=ily in a few key moments, but those are sadly few and far between
EXTD=\n\nThe trademark Boston guitar sound is still there, but instea
EXTD=d of in the forefront, they now seem to be overshadowed with popi
EXTD=sh tunes and lyrics. Unfortunately, the band doesn't have much to
EXTD=say anymore. Everything they want to say is on the album jacket:
EXTD="conserve fuel, avoid waste, learn about vegetarian living, avoi
EXTD=d animal products, shoot with cameras, not guns - vote for environ
EXTD=mental candidates, report child abuse and animal abuse, don't buy
EXTD=fur!" I don't think they left anything out. Oh wait...where are 
EXTD=those rocking Boston tunes???\n\n1. "I had a good time" - A nice 
EXTD=pop tune. Brad Delp sang on this one. I really had to check and s
EXTD=ee if I bought the right CD.\n\n2. "Stare out Your Window" - Anot
EXTD=her semi-pop tune and pointless kiddy lyrics\n\n3. "Corporate Ame
EXTD=rica" - Really the only rocking tune on the CD. It only has fire 
EXTD=because it coincides with the aforementioned album jacket stateme
EXTD=nts. The synths are all here and the Scholz man himself is playin
EXTD=g them, so why all the...oh never mind.\n\n4. "With You" - Writte
EXTD=n and sung by new edition Kimberley Dahme. Not a bad tune at all,
EXTD=but not a Boston tune. If Scholz left out his brief, heavy-hande
EXTD=d guitar solo then it wouldn't have surprised me if this would ha
EXTD=ve made the country charts.\n\n5. "Someone" - Another pop tune wi
EXTD=th Brad Delp on vocals.\n\n6. "Turn it off" - A rocking tune, but
EXTD=not in the Boston style\n\n7. "Cryin'" - I guess it wasn't too m
EXTD=emorable\n\n8. "Didn't Mean to Fall in Love" - Semi-popish tune a
EXTD=lmost Boston like. Brad Delp on vocals\n\n9. "You gave up on love
EXTD=" - Not a bad tune and one of the pleasant surprises is Tom Schol
EXTD=z on vocals and doesn't do a bad job. In fact, maybe Tom Scholz's
EXTD=vocal presence on some of the tracks are the reasons for their "
EXTD=popish" sound...if they had to be sung in his range...well, maybe
EXTD=, but that doesn't explain some of the writing.\n\n10. "Livin' fo
EXTD=r You" - Hey, wait a minute, wasn't this on the LAST album? Yes, 
EXTD=it was. Ok, it is a live version. Yes, it was a killer tune and n
EXTD=ice to have a live version, but c'mon guys. This time NINE years

EXTD=um, but I am because they call it "Boston". If they called it "To
EXTD=m Scholz and his egg-sucking dog" I would be cool with it. As it 
EXTD=is I can listen to it and pretend it is some other group. The tra

EXTD=t to go." This was exactly my thought when I first listened to th
EXTD=is album. I look at the band photos in the liner notes and see Sp
EXTD=inal Tap in those "spirit guide" outfits the girlfriend designed.
EXTD=\nAnd all the vegetarian/environmentalist/anti-capitalism crap ha

EXTD=We buy because we care how they sound. I'll be careful to snag a
EXTD=n MP3 or two of the next Boston release before plunking down my c

EXTD=IS ONE, December 12, 2002\nReviewer: Bill Moore (New Jersey]\nSti
EXTD=ll residing in my "top 10 favorite records of all time" is Boston
EXTD='s first album, Boston. The multi-million selling record is a fav
EXTD=orite amongst many of my generation - great tunes, incredible voc
EXTD=als and harmonies, and a scorching guitar sound like no other ban
EXTD=d then or since. It's one of those records you'd want in that sce
EXTD=nario "If you were stranded on a deserted island, and could only 
EXTD=have one CD, what would it be?" Ever since, I've been waiting for
EXTD=Boston to release another record of that caliber. They came clos
EXTD=e with the follow up Don't Look Back, but have been hardpressed t
EXTD=o hit the mark since. That trend continues, sadly, with Corporate
EXTD=America - probably the worst Boston record released to date. Thi
EXTD=s new record is a complete hodge podge of unfocused, pointless, u
EXTD=nrelated music that is uninteresting, too slow and even lacks the
EXTD=familiar Boston sound, in many places. \nEight years since the r
EXTD=elease of their last record Walk On (another stinker), Corporate 
EXTD=America offers ten tracks. Two songs, "Someone" and "Turn it Off"
EXTD=, have been available as downloadable MP3s for over three years n
EXTD=ow - Boston fans most likely have these tracks on their computers
EXTD=already. The forgettable tune "Livin' For You", is a live versio
EXTD=n of the same track that already appears on Walk On - why it reap
EXTD=pears here, makes no sense. So, technically, there are only 7 "ne
EXTD=w" tunes for Boston fans to latch on to. Of these, "I Had A Good 
EXTD=Time", "Corporate America" and "Didn't Mean to Fall In Love" are 
EXTD=about the only decent songs that still retain a bit of the Boston
EXTD=magic. And even these are mediocre, at best. The balance of song
EXTD=s are a weird mix of folk, soft rock and easy-listening music tha
EXTD=t don't sound like Boston at all. Brad Delp, who at one time did 
EXTD=all the lead and backup vocal work for Boston, helms lead vocals 
EXTD=on only three songs and provides backup harmonies - which still s
EXTD=ound incredibly great after all this time - on several others. Ha
EXTD=ndling vocals in his place on the other tracks are Fran Cosmo and
EXTD=new comer Kimberley Dahme. Dahme wrote the song "With You" which
EXTD=is horrible - doesn't even count as a Boston song. You listen to
EXTD=this song and ask yourself, "What the hell is going on here?" An
EXTD=d why Boston needs three lead vocalists, is beyond me. In additio
EXTD=n, each song has this bizarre group of musicians playing on it - 
EXTD=some are old band members, some new band members, some non-band m
EXTD=embers. This all gives the listener the impression that there are
EXTD=several bands playing on this record - nothing is unified and it
EXTD=s all very confusing. Regrettably missing from this effort (if yo
EXTD=u call this record an effort) is a classic organ/instrumental tun
EXTD=e, a la "Foreplay" or "The Journey". Also missing, is just one do
EXTD=wn and dirty, foot stomping, hard driving tune like "Smokin"? or 
EXTD=an ass-kickin' guitar-riff laden rock song like "Long Time" or ev
EXTD=en "Party". I am willing to bet none of this record will ever be 
EXTD=heard in rotation on radio stations nationwide. It's a huge letdo
EXTD=wn for long time fans like myself and overall a major disappointm
EXTD=ent considering how long Boston fans have been waiting for new ma
EXTD=terial.\n\nTom Sholtz needs to go back to the early days, bring b
EXTD=ack Barry Goudreau, Fran Sheehan and Sib Hashian and rekindle the
EXTD=creative magic that once was truly Boston. In its current incarn
EXTD=ation, Boston just doesnt live up to its reputation.\n\nI bought 
EXTD=three copies of Corporate America - one for myself and two others
EXTD=to give as Christmas presents to two other long time fans of Bos
EXTD=ton. This weekend, I will be returning the two unopened copies. C
EXTD=orporate America is no "gift" for anyone - its an exercise in pai
EXTD=n and frustration. If this review doesnt convince you, dont waste
EXTD=your money on the CD yet. I'll be putting my opened copy up on E
EXTD=bay soon - you can buy it from me for less than I paid at retail.
EXTD=Tom, you've let me down yet again.\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW

EXTD=Does vegetarianism make people lose their minds??? Brad, can't
EXTD=you do something about Tom??? Have him declared incompetent or s
EXTD=omething so you can write the checks and give the orders???? This
EXTD=is insane. Corporate America is the worst album of ALL TIME! It

EXTD=picture disks hanging up in my home studio and now every time I l
EXTD=ook at them I get a tear in my eye because I know now that Boston
EXTD=is gone - to the ...! What's up with Yoko Ono???? If she were a 
EXTD=true Boston fan she would have declined the offer and said, "Tom,
EXTD=why don't you put down the herb and call Barry, Sib and Fran (no
EXTD=t you Cosmo) and use that famous old Blues Brothers line "I'm put
EXTD=tin' the band back together"" (you know.....the one people liked?
EXTD=??). Brad, I know you're not responsible for this so I'll forgive
EXTD=you. Tom is burying your talent by holding the Boston name hosta
