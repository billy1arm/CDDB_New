EXTT0=AMG Review\n\nThere's a lot of Reverend Gary Davis out there, bu
EXTT0=t this CD, recorded between 1955 and 1957, is one of the best. D
EXTT0=avis was at the peak of his powers then. His playing on the inst
EXTT0=rumentals (of which there are a surprising number) testify to th
EXTT0=at, fluid and sturdy, and when he sings, he's never sounded in b
EXTT0=etter voice. Of particular interest is the fact that many of the
EXTT0=se pieces are made up on the spot  although you'd be hard presse
EXTT0=d tore come pieces more familiar, albeit in different versions, 
EXTT0=and  a real treat  some that have never been recorded elsewhere.
EXTT0=What truly sets this apart, though, is a long extract of Davis 
EXTT0=preaching in church, a side that's never been documented before.
EXTT0=And he's very much a raw gospel preacher, of a style that had f
EXTT0=allen out of fashion by the 50s. To hear him is an absolute reve
EXTT0=lation  you can feel the fervor in his voice, and his power over
EXTT0=the congregation. The sound quality throughout is superb, and t
EXTT0=his is an important addition to the Davis canon.  Chris Nickson
EXTT1=Rev. Gary Davis\n\nIn his prime of life, which is to say the lat
EXTT1=e '20s, the Reverend Gary Davis was one of the two most renowned
EXTT1=practitioners of the East Coast school of ragtime guitar - 35 ye
EXTT1=ars later, despite two decades spent playing on the streets of H
EXTT1=arlem in New York, he was still one of the giants in eople at a 
EXTT1=time, and an inspiration to dozens of modern guitarist/singers i
EXTT1=ncluding Bob Dylan, Taj Mahal, and Donovan - and Jorma Kaukonen, 
EXTT1=David Bromberg, and Ry Cooder, who studied with Davis. \nDavis w
EXTT1=as partially blind at birth, and lost what little sight he had b
EXTT1=efore he was an adult. He was self-taught on the guitar, beginni
EXTT1=ng at age six, and by the time he was in his 20s he had one of t
EXTT1=he most advanced guitar techniques of anyone in blues - his only 
EXTT1=peers among ragtime-based players were Blind Arthur Blake, Blind
EXTT1=Lemon Jefferson, and Blind Willie Johnson. Davis himself was a 
EXTT1=major influence on Blind Boy Fuller. \n\nDavis' influences inclu
EXTT1=ded gospel, marches, ragtime, jazz, and minstrel hokum, and he i
EXTT1=ntegrated them into a style that was his own. In 1911, when Davi
EXTT1=s was a still teenager, the family moved to Greenville, SC, and 
EXTT1=he fell under the influence of such ls Willie Walker, Sam Brooks
EXTT1=, and Baby Brooks. Davis moved to Durham in the mid-'20s, by whi
EXTT1=ch time he was a full-time street musician. He was celebrated no
EXTT1=t only for the diversity of styles that his playing embraced, bu
EXTT1=t also for his skills with the guitar, which were already virtua
EXTT1=lly unmatched in the blues field. \n\nDavis went into the record
EXTT1=ing studio for the first time in the '30s with the backing of a 
EXTT1=local businessman. Davis cut a mixture of blues and spirituals f
EXTT1=or the American Record Company label, but there was never an equ
EXTT1=itable agreement about payment for the recordings, and following
EXTT1=these sessions, it was 19 years before he entered the studio ag
EXTT1=ain. During that period, he went through many changes. Like many
EXTT1=other street buskers, Davis always interspersed gospel songs am
EXTT1=id his blues and ragtime numbers, to make it harder for the poli
EXTT1=ce to interrupt him. He began taking thaterial more seriously, a
EXTT1=nd in 1937 he became an ordained minister. After that, he usuall
EXTT1=y refused to perform any blues. \n\nDavis moved to New York in t
EXTT1=he early '40s and began preaching and playing on street corners 
EXTT1=in Harlem. He recorded again at the end of the 1940s, with a pai
EXTT1=r of gospel songs, but it wasn't until the mid-'50s that a real 
EXTT1=following for his work began developing anew. His music, all of 
EXTT1=it now of a spiritual nature, began showing up on labels such as
EXTT1=Stinson, Folkways, and Riverside, where he recorded seven songs
EXTT1=in early 1956. Davis was "rediscovered" by the folk revival mov
EXTT1=ement, and after some initial reticence, he agreed to perform as
EXTT1=part of the budding folk music revival, appearing at the Newpor
EXTT1=t Folk Festival, where his raspy voiced sung sermons - most notab
EXTT1=ly his transcendent "Samson and Delilah (If I Had My Way)"  a so
EXTT1=ng most closely associated with Blind Willie f the proceedings f
EXTT1=or several years. He also recorded a live album for the Vanguard
EXTT1=label at one such concert, as well as appearing on several Newp
EXTT1=ort live anthology collections. He was also the subject of two t
EXTT1=elevision documentaries, one in 1967 and one in 1970. \n\nDavis 
EXTT1=became one of the most popular players on the folk revival and b
EXTT1=lues revival scenes, playing before large and enthusiastic audie
EXTT1=nces - most of the songs that he performed were spirituals, but t
EXTT1=hey weren't that far removed from the blues that he'd recorded i
EXTT1=n the 1930s, and his guitar technique was intact. Davis' skills 
EXTT1=as a player, on the jumbo Gibson acoustic models that he favored
EXTT1=, were undiminished, and he was a startling figure to hear, pick
EXTT1=ing and strumming complicated rhythms and counter-melodies. Davi
EXTT1=s became a teacher during this period, and his students included
EXTT1=somevid Bromberg and the Jefferson Airplane's Jorma Kaukonen (w
EXTT1=ho later recorded Davis' "I'll Be Alright" on his acclaimed solo
EXTT1=album Quah!). \n\nThe Reverend Gary Davis left behind a fairly 
EXTT1=large body of modern (i.e. post-World War II) recordings, well i
EXTT1=nto the 1960s, taking the revival of his career in his stride as
EXTT1=a way of carrying the message of the gospel to a new generation
EXTT1=He even recorded anew some of his blues and ragtime standards 
EXTT1=in the studio, for the benefit of his students.  Bruce Eder-=AMG
