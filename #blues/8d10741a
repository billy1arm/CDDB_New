EXTT0=Lightnin' Hopkins \n\nAKA  Sam Hopkins \nBorn  Mar 15, 1912 in Centerv
EXTT0=ille, TX \nDied  Jan 30, 1982 in Houston, TX \n\nwas a Texas country b
EXTT0=luesman of the highest caliber whose career began in the 1920s and str
EXTT0=etched all the way into the 1980s. Along the way, Hopkins watched th
EXTT0=e genre change remarkably, but he never appreciably altered his mournf
EXTT0=ul Lone Star sound, which translated onto both acoustic and electric g
EXTT0=uitar. Hopkins' nimble dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy
EXTT0=, and his fascinating penchant for improvising lyrics to fit whateve
EXTT0=r situation might arise made him a beloved blues troubadour.\nHopkins
EXTT0=' brothers John Henry and Joel were also talented bluesmen, but it wa
EXTT0=s Sam who became a star. In 1920, he met the legendary Blind Lemon Jef
EXTT0=ferson at a social function, and even got a chance to play with him. L
EXTT0=ater, Hopkins served as Jefferson's guide. In his teens, Hopkins bega
EXTT0=n working with another pre-war great, singer Texas Alexander, who wa
EXTT0=s his cousin. A mid-'30s stretch in Houston's County Prison Farm for t
EXTT0=he young guitarist interrupted their partnership for a time, but whe
EXTT0=n he was freed, Hopkins hooked back up with the older bluesman.\n\nTh
EXTT0=e pair was dishing out their lowdown brand of blues in Houston's Thir
EXTT0=d Ward in 1946 when talent scout Lola Anne Cullum came across them. Sh
EXTT0=e had already engineered a pact with Los Angeles-based Aladdin Record
EXTT0=s for another of her charges, pianist Amos Milburn, and Cullum saw th
EXTT0=e same sort of opportunity within Hopkins' dusty country blues. Alexan
EXTT0=der wasn't part of the deal - instead, Cullum paired Hopkins with piani
EXTT0=st Wilson "Thunder" Smith, sensibly re-christened the guitarist "Light
EXTT0=nin'," and presto! Hopkins was very soon an Aladdin recording artist
EXTT0=\n\n"Katie May," cut on November 9, 1946, in L.A. with Smith lendin
EXTT0=g a hand on the 88s, was Lightnin' Hopkins' first regional seller of n
EXTT0=ote. He recorded prolifically for Aladdin in both L.A. and Houston int
EXTT0=o 1948, scoring a national R&B hit for the firm with his "Shotgun Blue
EXTT0=s." "Short Haired Woman," "Abilene," and "Big Mama Jump," among many A
EXTT0=laddin gems, were evocative Texas blues rooted in an earlier era
EXTT0=\n\nA load of other labels recorded the wily Hopkins after that, bot
EXTT0=h in a solo context and with a small rhythm section: Modern/RPM (his u
EXTT0=ncompromising "Tim Moore's Farm" was an R&B hit in 1949) - Gold Star (w
EXTT0=here he hit with "T-Model Blues" that same year) - Sittin' in With ("Gi
EXTT0=ve Me Central 209" and "Coffee Blues" were national chart entries in 1
EXTT0=952) and its Jax subsidiary - the major labels Mercury and Decca - and
EXTT0=, in 1954, a remarkable batch of sides for Herald where Hopkins playe
EXTT0=d blistering electric guitar on a series of blasting rockers ("Lightni
EXTT0=n's Boogie," "Lightnin's Special," and the amazing "Hopkins' Sky Hop"
EXTT0=) in front of drummer Ben Turner and bassist Donald Cooks (who must ha
EXTT0=ve had bleeding fingers, so torrid were some of the tempos).\n\nBut Ho
EXTT0=pkins' style was apparently too rustic and old-fashioned for the new g
EXTT0=eneration of rock and roll enthusiasts (they should have checked out "Ho
EXTT0=pkins' Sky Hop"). He was back on the Houston scene by 1959, largely fo
EXTT0=rgotten. Fortunately, folklorist Mack McCormick rediscovered the guita
EXTT0=rist, who was dusted off and presented as a folk-blues artist - a rol
EXTT0=e that Hopkins was born to play. Pioneering musicologist Sam Charter
EXTT0=s produced Hopkins in a solo context for Folkways Records that same ye
EXTT0=ar, cutting an entire LP in Hopkins' tiny apartment (on a borrowed gui
EXTT0=tar). The results helped introduced his music to an entirely new audie
EXTT0=nce.\n\nLightnin' Hopkins went from gigging at back-alley gin joints t
EXTT0=o starring at collegiate coffeehouses, appearing on TV programs, and t
EXTT0=ouring Europe to boot. His once-flagging recording career went right t
EXTT0=hrough the roof, with albums for World Pacific - Vee-Jay - Bluesville - B
EXTT0=obby Robinson's Fire label (where he cut his classic "Mojo Hand" in 19
EXTT0=60) - Candid - Arhoolie - Prestige - Verve - and, in 1965, the first of sev
EXTT0=eral LPs for Stan Lewis' Shreveport-based Jewel logo.\n\nHopkins gener
EXTT0=ally demanded full payment before he'd deign to sit down and record, a
EXTT0=nd seldom indulged a producer's desire for more than one take of any s
EXTT0=ong. His singular sense of country time befuddled more than a few unse
EXTT0=asoned musicians - from the 1960s on, his solo work is usually preferab
EXTT0=le to band-backed material.\n\nFilmmaker Les Blank captured the Texa
EXTT0=s troubadour's informal lifestyle most vividly in his acclaimed 1967 d
EXTT0=ocumentary, The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins. As one of the la
EXTT0=st great country bluesmen, Hopkins was a fascinating figure who bridge
EXTT0=d the gap between rural and urban styles. \n\nby Bill Dahl
