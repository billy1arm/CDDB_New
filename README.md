# CDDB_New
My efforts to clean up the final freedb-complete-20200401.tar CDDB entries

Original Folders are:

blues
classical
country
data
folk
jazz
misc
newage
reggae
rock
soundtrack

After processing by my cleanup tool, the entries will be moved to:

#blues
#classical
#country
#data
#folk
#jazz
#misc
#newage
#reggae
#rock
#soundtrack

Any entries which are unreadable due to encoding issues are placed here:
(Over time I will attempt to find the missing information and update the entries)

#blues_broken
#classical_broken
#country_broken
#data_broken
#folk_broken
#jazz_broken
#misc_broken
#newage_broken
#reggae_broken
#rock_broken
#soundtrack_broken

Finally, there will be a set of folders which will contain processed entries which have been cleaned up:
(This will be a fairly slow process as each entry will need to be compared to the original to ensure no major problems)

blues_new
classical_new
country_new
data_new
folk_new
jazz_new
misc_new
newage_new
reggae_new
rock_new
soundtrack_new
